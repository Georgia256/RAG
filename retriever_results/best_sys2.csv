Who is Harry Potter's best friend?,Ron Weasley,"Question: Who is Harry Potter's best friend?
Chain of thought: The context mentions Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger as Harry's close friends, but it seems to highlight Ron and Hermione's absence in Harry's life, implying that Ron and Hermione are his best friends.

Answer: Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger.","” into
long, sickly sentences: She had interviewed other people about him too.
Harry has at last found love at Hogwarts. His close friend, Colin
Creevey, says that Harry is rarely seen out of the company of one
Hermione Granger, a stunningly pretty Muggle-born girl who, like
Harry, is one of the top students in the school.
From the moment the article had appeared, Harry had had to endure people
— Slytherins, mainly — quoting it at him as he passed and making sneering
comments.
“Want a hanky, Potter, in case ere you’re going, Potter!”
“Sorry, Professor —”
“I’ve just been looking for you in the Gryffindor common room. Well, here
it is, we’ve done everything we could think of, and there doesn’t seem to be
anything wrong with it at all. You’ve got a very good friend somewhere,Potter. . . .”
Harry’s jaw dropped. She was holding out his Firebolt, and it looked as
magnificent as ever.
“I can have it back?” Harry said weakly. “Seriously?”
“Seriously,” said Professor McGonagall, and she was actually smiling. “I
daresay or
companionship on his trip to Diagon Alley. He preferred to operate alone. The
adult Voldemort is the same. You will hear many of his Death Eaters claiming
that they are in his confidence, that they alone are close to him, even
understand him. They are deluded. Lord Voldemort has never had a friend,
nor do I believe that he has ever wanted one.
“And lastly — I hope you are not too sleepy to pay attention to this, Harry
— the young Tom Riddle liked to collect trophies. You saw the box of stolen
articles he Harry with spit.
Ron obviously realized that he’d gotten Harry into trouble, because he
hadn’t called again. Harry’s other best friend from Hogwarts, Hermione
Granger, hadn’t been in touch either. Harry suspected that Ron had warned
Hermione not to call, which was a pity, because Hermione, the cleverest witch
in Harry’s year, had Muggle parents, knew perfectly well how to use a
telephone, and would probably have had enough sense not to say that she
went to Hogwarts.
So Harry had had no word from any of his  py birthday to me . . .”
No cards, no presents, and he would be spending the evening pretending
not to exist. He gazed miserably into the hedge. He had never felt so lonely.
More than anything else at Hogwarts, more even than playing Quidditch,
Harry missed his best friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. They,
however, didn’t seem to be missing him at all. Neither of them had written to
him all summer, even though Ron had said he was going to ask Harry to come
and stay.
Countless times, Harry had been o n!
She’s still Ron’s sister.
I’m his best mate!
That’ll make it worse.
If I talked to him first —
He’d hit you.
What if I don’t care?
He’s your best mate!
Harry barely noticed that they were climbing through the portrait hole into
the sunny common room, and only vaguely registered the small group of
seventh years clustered together there, until Hermione cried, “Katie! You’re
back! Are you okay?”
Harry stared: It was indeed Katie Bell, looking completely healthy and
surrounded by her jubilant friends.
“I’m r ugh Riddle was a friend he’d had when he was very small, and had half-
forgotten. But this was absurd. He’d never had friends before Hogwarts,
Dudley had made sure of that.
Nevertheless, Harry was determined to find out more about Riddle, so next
day at break, he headed for the trophy room to examine Riddle’s special
award, accompanied by an interested Hermione and a thoroughly
unconvinced Ron, who told them he’d seen enough of the trophy room to last
him a lifetime.
Riddle’s burnished gold shield was tucke  friend.
He’s a convicted murderer, but he’s broken out of Wizard prison and he’s on
the run. He likes to keep in touch with me, though . . . keep up with my
news . . . check if I’m happy. . . .”
And, grinning broadly at the look of horror on Uncle Vernon’s face, Harry
set off toward the station exit, Hedwig rattling along in front of him, for what
looked like a much better summer than the last.

What house is Harry Potter sorted into?,Gryffindor,"Chain of thought: The text is describing the Sorting Ceremony and the four Houses at Hogwarts. The context is setting the scene for the ceremony, explaining the importance of the Sorting and the characteristics of each House. The text mentions Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin, but doesn't explicitly state which House Harry is sorted into.

Answer: Gryffindor","f, Ravenclaw, and
Slytherin. Each House has its own noble history and each has produced
outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs
will earn your House points, while any rule-breaking will lose House points.
At the end of the year, the House with the most points is awarded the House
Cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever House
becomes yours.
“The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest
of the school. I suggest you al  year, the House with the most points is awarded the House
Cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever House

“The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest
of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can
while you are waiting.”
Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville’s cloak, which was fastened
under his left ear, and on Ron’s smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to
flatten his hair.
“I shall return when we are r 
about nervously.
“Welcome to Hogwarts,” said Professor McGonagall. “The start-of-term
banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall,
you will be sorted into your Houses. The Sorting is a very importantceremony because, while you are here, your House will be something like
your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your
House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free time in your House
common room.

At the end of the  on the third floor a few days later. “You belong at Hogwarts and
Sirius knows it. Personally, I think he’s being selfish.”
“That’s a bit harsh, Hermione,” said Ron, frowning as he attempted to prize
off a bit of mold that had attached itself firmly to his finger, “you wouldn’t
want to be stuck inside this house without company.”
“He’ll have company!” said Hermione. “It’s headquarters to the Order of
the Phoenix, isn’t it? He just got his hopes up that Harry would be coming to
live here with him.”
“I don’t  House you’ll be in?
I’ve been asking around, and I hope I’m in Gryffindor, it sounds by far the

had better change, you know, I expect we’ll be there soon.”
And she left, taking the toadless boy with her.“Whatever House I’m in, I hope she’s not in it,” said Ron. He threw his
wand back into his trunk. “Stupid spell — George gave it to me, bet he knew
it was  e wizard with a shock of white hair, was carrying an ancient hat and a
four-legged stool out of the hall.
“Oh,” said Hermione softly, “we’ve missed the Sorting!”
New students at Hogwarts were sorted into Houses by trying on the Sorting
Hat, which shouted out the House they were best suited to (Gryffindor,
Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, or Slytherin). Professor McGonagall strode off toward
her empty seat at the staff table, and Harry and Hermione set off in the other
direction, as quietly as possible, toward the Gry  and

“Am I?” said Harry, feeling dazed.
“Goodness, didn’t you know, I’d have found out everything I could if it
was me,” said Hermione. “Do either of you know what House you’ll be in?

What is the name of Harry Potter's owl?,Hedwig,"Chain of thought: The story is describing a scene where Harry Potter is receiving gifts from his friends, and one of the gifts is a owl. The owl's name is mentioned earlier in the story...

Answer: The name of Harry Potter's owl is Hedwig.","rry Potter’s, incidentally, who fought the Death Eaters
alongside him at the Ministry in June and —”
But the rest of this story was obscured by the large birdcage standing on
top of it. Inside it was a magnificent snowy owl. Her amber eyes surveyed the
room imperiously, her head swiveling occasionally to gaze at her snoring
master. Once or twice she clicked her beak impatiently, but Harry was too
deeply asleep to hear her.
A large trunk stood in the very middle of the room. Its lid was open; it
looked expec ng, jewel-bright eyes. Harry now carried a
large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep with her head under her
wing. He couldn’t stop stammering his thanks, sounding just like Professor
Quirrell.
“Don’ mention it,” said Hagrid gruffly. “Don’ expect you’ve had a lotta
presents from them Dursleys. Just Ollivanders left now — only place fer
wands, Ollivanders, and yeh gotta have the best wand.”
A magic wand . . . this was what Harry had been really looking forward to.
The last shop was narrow and s He
brought it carefully inside. The owl dropped its letter onto Harry’s seat and
began zooming around their compartment, apparently very pleased with itself
for accomplishing its task. Hedwig clicked her beak with a sort of dignified
disapproval. Crookshanks sat up in his seat, following the owl with his great
yellow eyes. Ron, noticing this, snatched the owl safely out of harm’s way.
Harry picked up the letter. It was addressed to him. He ripped open the
letter, and shouted, “It’s from Sirius!”
“What?” sai eeching, hooting, and flapping their wings.
“Harry!” said Hermione breathlessly, plunging her hands into the feathery
mass and pulling out a screech owl bearing a long, cylindrical package. “I
think I know what this means — open this one first!”
Harry ripped off the brown packaging. Out rolled a tightly furled copy of
March’s edition of 
The Quibbler. 
He unrolled it to see his own face grinning
sheepishly at him from the front cover. In large red letters across his picture
were the words:
 
HARRY POTTER SP g.” He waved his wand
without really concentrating; his bullfrog swelled like a green balloon and
emitted a high-pitched whistle.
“Silencio!” 
said Hermione hastily, pointing her wand at Harry’s frog,
which deflated silently before them. “Well, he mustn’t do it again, that’s all. I
just don’t know how we’re going to let him know. We can’t send him an owl.”
“I don’t reckon he’ll risk it again,” said Ron. “He’s not stupid, he knows
she nearly got him. 
Silencio!
”
The large and ugly raven in front of him let  tched voice from the
depths of the chair in which the owl had landed. “You are very fortunate
indeed. Your blunder has not ruined everything. He is dead.”
“My Lord!” gasped the man on the floor. “My Lord, I am . . . I am so
pleased . . . and so sorry. . . .”
“Nagini,” said the cold voice, “you are out of luck. I will not be feeding
Wormtail to you, after all . . . but never mind, never mind . . . there is still
Harry Potter. . . .”
The snake hissed. Harry could see its tongue fluttering.
“Now, Wormtail,” sa Hagrid, clapping a hand to his
forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse, and from yet another
pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl — a real, live, rather ruffled-
looking owl — a long quill, and a roll of parchment. With his tongue between
his teeth he scribbled a note that Harry could read upside down:
Dear Professor Dumbledore,
Given Harry his letter.
Taking him to buy his things tomorrow.
Weather’s horrible. Hope you’re well.
Hagrid
Hagrid rolled up the note, gave it to the owl, which nce: A
dazed and ruffled-looking barn owl was sitting outside on the kitchen sill,
having just collided with the closed window.
Ignoring Uncle Vernon’s anguished yell of “OWLS!” Harry crossed the
room at a run and wrenched the window open again. The owl stuck out its leg,
to which a small roll of parchment was tied, shook its feathers, and took off
the moment Harry had pulled off the letter. Hands shaking, Harry unfurled the
second message, which was written very hastily and blotchily in black ink.

A large picture of a familiar, hook-nosed, black-haired man stared up at
them all, beneath a headline that read:

“No!” said Ron and Hermione loudly.
Hermione was quickest; she snatched up the newspaper and began to read
the accompanying story out loud.

Madam Marchbanks. ‘This is a further disgusting att  at Hogwarts,” said Harry. “I mean, there’s Dumbledore, for one

with a picture of Hagrid looking extremely shifty.
DUMBLEDORE’S GIANT MISTAKE
Albus Dumbledore, eccentric headmaster of Hogwarts School of
Witchcraft and Wizardry, has never been afraid to make
controversial staff appointments, 
writes Rita Skeeter, Special
Correspondent.
 In September of this year, he hired Alastor “Mad-
Eye” Moody, the notoriously jinx-happy ex-Auror, to teach Defense
Against  eep-seated
confusion.
“He might even be pretending,” said one specialist. “This could
be a plea for attention.”
The 
Daily Prophet,
 however, has unearthed worrying facts about
Harry Potter that Albus Dumbledore, headmaster of Hogwarts, has
carefully concealed from the Wizarding public.
“Potter can speak Parseltongue,” reveals Draco Malfoy, a
Hogwarts fourth year. “There were a lot of attacks on students acouple of years ago, and most people thought Potter was behind

Confederation of Wizards, and reinstated Chief Warlock of the

believed, but recruiting followers once more for a fresh attempt to seize
power. Meanwhile the Boy Who Lived —

What spell is used to disarm an opponent?,Expelliarmus,"Question: What spell is used to disarm an opponent?
Chain of thought: The context is about defensive spells and dueling, and Harry is trying to defend himself against the Death Eaters. I remember a scene in the book where Harry is learning defensive spells at Hogwarts, and one of the spells he learns is the Disarming Spell, which is called ""Expelliarmus"".
Answer: Expelliarmus.","sed

secure, risk-free way —”
“What use is that?” said Harry loudly. “If we’re going to be attacked it
won’t be in a —”
“
Hand, 
Mr. Potter!” sang Professor Umbridge.
Harry thrust his fist in the air. Professor Umbridge promptly turned away
from him again, but now several other people had their hands up too.
“And your name is?” Professor Umbridge said to Dean.
“Dean Thomas.”
“Well, Mr. Thomas?”
“Well, it’s like Harry said, isn’t it?”  lay and returned with Harry’s wand, which he thrust
roughly into Harry’s hand without looking at him. Then Wormtail resumed his
place in the circle of watching Death Eaters.
“You have been taught how to duel, Harry Potter?” said Voldemort softly,
his red eyes glinting through the darkness.
At these words Harry remembered, as though from a former life, the
dueling club at Hogwarts he had attended briefly two years ago. . . . All he
had learned there was the Disarming Spell,
 “Expelliarmus”
 . . . and what us !”
 Harry yelled. The spell hit the skrewt’s armor again and
ricocheted off; Harry staggered back a few paces and fell over.
“IMPEDIMENTA!”
The skrewt was inches from him when it froze — he had managed to hit it
on its fleshy, shell-less underside. Panting, Harry pushed himself away from it
and ran, hard, in the opposite direction — the Impediment Curse was not
permanent; the skrewt would be regaining the use of its legs at any moment.
He took a left path and hit a dead end, a right, and hit another; forcin tuation where you’re facing it. CONSTANT
VIGILANCE!” he roared, and the whole class jumped again.
“Now . . . those three curses — 
Avada Kedavra,
 Imperius, and Cruciatus —
are known as the Unforgivable Curses. The use of any one of them on a
fellow human being is enough to earn a life sentence in Azkaban. That’s what
you’re up against. That’s what I’ve got to teach you to fight. You need
preparing. You need arming. But most of all, you need to practice 
constant,
never-ceasing vigilance.

dangerous enemy, another to speak of them, as Snape was doing, with aloving caress in his voice?
“Your defenses,” said Snape, a little louder, “must therefore be as flexible
and inventive as the arts you seek to undo. These pictures” — he indicated a
few of them as he swept past — “give a fair representation of what happens to
those who suffer, for instance, the Cruciatus Curse” — he waved a hand
toward a witch who was clearly shrieking in agony — “feel the Dementor’s
Kiss” — a wizard lying huddled and ensive magic.

3. Placing the use of defensive magic in a context for practical use.
 
For a couple of minutes the room was full of the sound of scratching quills
on parchment. When everyone had copied down Professor Umbridge’s three
course aims she said, “Has everybody got a copy of

There was a dull murmur of assent throughout the class.

Anthony Goldstein, his own wand would fly out of his hand, yet Anthony did
not seem to be making a sound. Harry did not have to look far for the solution
of the mystery, however; Fred and George were several feet from Smith and
taking it in turns to point their wands at his back.
“Sorry, Harry,” said George hastily, when Harry caught his eye. “Couldn’t
resist . . .”
Harry walked around the other pairs, trying to correct those who were
doing the spell wrong. Ginny was teamed with Michael Corner; s s

is exactly going to help us against You-Know-Who,
do you?”
“I’ve used it against him,” said Harry quietly. “It saved my life last June.”
Smith opened his mouth stupidly. The rest of the room was very quiet.
“But if you think it’s beneath you, you can leave,” Harry said.
Smith did not move. Nor di"
Who teaches Potions at Hogwarts?,Severus Snape,"Chain of thought: I've got this! I've read the Harry Potter books multiple times, and I'm sure I can recall who teaches Potions at Hogwarts.

Answer: Severus Snape teaches Potions at Hogwarts."," Potions class
was about as safe as poking a sleeping dragon in the eye.
Potions lessons took place in one of the large dungeons. Thursday
afternoon’s lesson proceeded in the usual way. Twenty cauldrons stood
steaming between the wooden desks, on which stood brass scales and jars of
ingredients. Snape prowled through the fumes, making waspish remarks about
the Gryffindors’ work while the Slytherins sniggered appreciatively. Draco
Malfoy, who was Snape’s favorite student, kept flicking puffer-fish eyes at
Ro wspaper and began to read
the accompanying story out loud.
“‘Severus Snape, long-standing Potions master at Hogwarts School of
Witchcraft and Wizardry, was today appointed headmaster in the most
important of several staffing changes at the ancient school. Following the

“Well, Potter, you know why you are here,” he said. “The headmaster has
asked me to teach you Occlumency. I can only hope that you prove more
adept at it than Potions.”
“Right,” said Harry tersely.
“This may not be an ordinary class, Potter,” said Snape, his eyes narrowed
malevolently, “but I am still your teacher and you will therefore call me ‘sir’
or ‘Professor’ at all times.”
“Yes . . . 
sir,
” said Harry.
“Now, Occlumency. As I told you back in your dear godfather’s kitchen,
this branch o  for a Love Potion would be force-fed
poison.
“Please, Hermione, tell me you weren’t one of the forty-six,” said Ron as
they left the Great Hall for their first lesson. Hermione suddenly became very
interested in searching her bag for her schedule and didn’t answer.
All day long, the dwarfs kept barging into their classes to deliver
valentines, to the annoyance of the teachers, and late that afternoon as the
Gryffindors were walking upstairs for Charms, one of the dwarfs caught up
with Harry.
“Oi, you! ’Arr y had tea with Hagrid to look forward to, because the
Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so
far.
At the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the idea that Professor Snape
disliked him. By the end of the first Potions lesson, he knew he’d been wrong.
Snape didn’t dislike Harry — he 
hated
 him.
Potions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons. It was colder here
than up in the main castle, and would have been quite creepy enough without
the pickled animals float ter-
of-fact tone. “You two will be expelled if you get into any more trouble, and
I’ve got a clean record. So all you need to do is cause enough mayhem to
keep Snape busy for five minutes or so.”
Harry smiled feebly. Deliberately causing mayhem in Snape’s Potions class
was about as safe as poking a sleeping dragon in the eye.
Potions lessons took place in one of the large dungeons. Thursday
afternoon’s lesson proceeded in the usual way. Twenty cauldrons stood
steaming between the wooden desks, on which sto .”
“But that’s impossible,” Harry said as Ron laughed.
“No, it’s not,” said Hermione. “All we’d need would be some Polyjuice
Potion.”
“What’s that?” said Ron and Harry together.
“Snape mentioned it in class a few weeks ago —”
“D’you think we’ve got nothing better to do in Potions than listen to
Snape?” muttered Ron.
“It transforms you into somebody else. Think about it! We could change
into three of the Slytherins. No one would know it was us. Malfoy would
probably tell us anything. He’s probably boasting a med glad that they were being
shepherded from class to class by teachers, but Harry found it very irksome.
One person, however, seemed to be thoroughly enjoying the atmosphere of
terror and suspicion. Draco Malfoy was strutting around the school as though
he had just been appointed Head Boy. Harry didn’t realize what he was so
pleased about until the Potions lesson about two weeks after Dumbledore and
Hagrid had left, when, sitting right behind Malfoy, Harry overheard him
gloating to Crabbe and Goyle.

Answer: The Weasley's house is not explicitly mentioned in this context, but it is implied that the story is taking place within the Weasley family's home.","gh the house to the upper stories.
“What are Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes?” Harry asked as they climbed.
Ron and Ginny both laughed, although Hermione didn’t.
“Mum found this stack of order forms when she was cleaning Fred and
George’s room,” said Ron quietly. “Great long price lists for stuff they’ve
invented. Joke stuff, you know. Fake wands and trick sweets, loads of stuff. It
was brilliant, I never knew they’d been inventing all that . . .”
“We’ve been hearing explosions out of their room for ages, but we n . Weasley’s face.
“And Arthur Weasley too! What are you doing here, Arthur?”
“I work here,” said Mr. Weasley shortly.
“Not 
here, 
surely?” said Mr. Malfoy, raising his eyebrows and glancing
toward the door over Mr. Weasley’s shoulder. “I thought you were up on the
second floor. . . . Don’t you do something that involves sneaking Muggle
artifacts home and bewitching them?”
“No,” said Mr. Weasley curtly, his fingers now biting into Harry’s shoulder.
“What are 
you
 doing here anyway?” Harry asked Lucius Malf ?” asked Harry, who found Ron just as
interesting as Ron found him.
“Er — yes, I think so,” said Ron. “I think Mum’s got a second cousin
who’s an accountant, but we never talk about him.”
“So you must know loads of magic already.”The Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale boy
in Diagon Alley had talked about.
“I heard you went to live with Muggles,” said Ron. “What are they like?”
“Horrible — well, not all of them. My aunt and uncle and cousin are,
though. Wish I’d had three wiza ning on. “Right.”
“Yeah, we’ll come too,” said George.
“You stay where you are!”
 snarled Mrs. Weasley.
Harry and Ron edged out of the kitchen, and they, Hermione, and Ginny set
off along the narrow hallway and up the rickety staircase that zigzagged
through the house to the upper stories.

“Home,” “school,” and “work” were there, but there was also “traveling,”
“lost,” “hospital,” “prison,” and, in the position where the number twelve
would be on a normal clock, “mortal peril.”
Eight of the hands were currently pointing to the “home” position, but Mr.

It seemed to go on for hours. Mrs. Weasley had shouted herself hoarse
before she turned on Harry, who backed away.
“I’m very pleased to see you, Harry, dear,” she said. “Come in and have
some breakfast.”
She turned and walked back into the house and Harry, after a nervous
glance at Ron, who nodded encouragingly, followed her.
The kitchen was small and rather cramped. There was a scrubbed wooden
table and cha nt with a wave of her wand: In the flash of light caused by Mrs.
Weasley’s charm, Harry caught a glimpse of what looked like the plan of a
building.
Mrs. Weasley had seen him looking. She snatched the plan off the table and
stuffed it into Bill’s heavily laden arms.
“This sort of thing ought to be cleared away promptly at the end of
meetings,” she snapped before sweeping off toward an ancient dresser from
which she started unloading dinner plates.
Bill took out his wand, muttered 
“Evanesco!”

sofa. Once they had done so, Scrimgeour spoke.
“I have some questions for the three of you, and I think it will be best if we
do it individually. If you two” — he pointed at Harry and Hermione — “can
wait upstairs, I will start with Ronald.”
“We’re not going anywhere,” said Harry, while Hermione nodded
vigorously. “You can speak to us together, or not at all.”
Scrimgeour gave Harry a cold, appraising look. Harry ha"

The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.
Harry read the words slowly, as though he would have only one chance to
take in their meaning, and he read the last of them aloud.
“‘The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death’ . . .” A horrible thought
came to him, and wit . Again, your readers will have to buy my book for the
whole story, but there is no question that Dumbledore took an unnatural
interest in Potter from the word go. Whether that was really in the boy’s
best interests — well, we’ll see. It’s certainly an open secret that Potter
has had a most troubled adolescence.”
I ask whether Skeeter is still in touch with Harry Potter, whom she so
famously interviewed last year: a breakthrough piece in which Potter
spoke exclusively of his conviction that You-Know-Who had essor Snape was teaching the subject. Professor
Slughorn, however, is perfectly happy to accept N.E.W.T. students with

anything —”

What platform do students use to board the Hogwarts Express?,Platform 9 3/4,"Chain of thought: The story mentions students sliding through a barrier and platform nine and three-quarters materializing. The Hogwarts Express is described as arriving at platform nine and three-quarters. The context suggests that the platform is a magical one, and students use it to board the Hogwarts Express.

Answer: Platform nine and three-quarters."," they leaned
casually against the barrier, chatting unconcernedly, and slid sideways

The Hogwarts Express, a gleaming scarlet steam engine, was already there,
clouds of steam billowing from it, through which the many Hogwarts students
and parents on the platform appeared like dark ghosts. Pigwidgeon became
noisier than ever in response to the hooting of many owls through the mist.

have gone on all summer, in fact, and that he would never arrive at King’s

“Take it,” he said, and he thrust the sack into George’s hands.

platform nine and three quarters, where the Hogwarts Express stood belching
sooty steam over a platform packed with departing students and their families.Harry inhaled the familiar smell and felt his spirits soar. . . . He was really

behind her at the wrought-iron arch spanning the platform, through which
new arrivals would come.

“Thanks, Lee,” said Harr  ten. The only tricky part was doing this in an
unobtrusive way, so as to avoid attracting Muggle attention. They did it in
groups today; Harry, Ron, and Hermione (the most conspicuous, since they
were accompanied by Pigwidgeon and Crookshanks) went first; they leaned
casually against the barrier, chatting unconcernedly, and slid sideways
through it . . . and as they did so, platform nine and three-quarters
materialized in front of them.
The Hogwarts Express, a gleaming scarlet steam engine, was already the  yelled, seeing a gigantic silhouette at the far end of the
platform.
“All righ’, Harry?” Hagrid bellowed back, waving. “See yeh at the feast if
we don’ drown!”
First years traditionally reached Hogwarts Castle by sailing across the lake
with Hagrid.
“Oooh, I wouldn’t fancy crossing the lake in this weather,” said Hermione
fervently, shivering as they inched slowly along the dark platform with the
rest of the crowd. A hundred horseless carriages stood waiting for them
outside the station. Harry, Ron, Hermio o eleven. Mr. Weasley dashed
across the road to get trolleys for their trunks and they all hurried into the
station.
Harry had caught the Hogwarts Express the previous year. The tricky part
was getting onto platform nine and three-quarters, which wasn’t visible to theMuggle eye. What you had to do was walk through the solid barrier dividing
platforms nine and ten. It didn’t hurt, but it had to be done carefully so that
none of the Muggles noticed you vanishing.

What is the name of Harry's godfather?,Sirius Black,"Chain of thought: I remember the conversation between Harry, Fudge, and others, where Fudge mentions that Sirius Black was Harry's godfather. I recall that Sirius was a close friend of James and Lily Potter, and was even the best man at their wedding. I also remember that Sirius was named as Harry's godfather.

Answer: Sirius Black is Harry's godfather.","Harry. But you see what they’re doing? They want to turn you into someone
nobody will believe. Fudge is behind it, I’ll bet anything. They want wizards
on the street to think you’re just some stupid boy who’s a bit of a joke, who
tells ridiculous tall stories because he loves being famous and wants to keep it
going.”“I didn’t ask — I didn’t want — 
Voldemort killed my parents!
” Harry
spluttered. “I got famous because he murdered my family but couldn’t kill
me! Who wants to be famous for that? Don’t they th ” chimed in Professor
Flitwick. “Inseparable!”
“Of course they were,” said Fudge. “Potter trusted Black beyond all his
other friends. Nothing changed when they left school. Black was best man
when James married Lily. Then they named him godfather to Harry. Harry hasno idea, of course. You can imagine how the idea would torment him.”
“Because Black turned out to be in league with You-Know-Who?”
whispered Madam Rosmerta.
“Worse even than that, m’dear. . . .” Fudge dropped his voice and
proceeded in a sort of  y
others. . . . At last he forced himself to speak.
“You’re not,” he said, his quiet voice full of hatred.
“Not what?” snapped Riddle.
“Not the greatest sorcerer in the world,” said Harry, breathing fast. “Sorry
to disappoint you and all that, but the greatest wizard in the world is Albus
Dumbledore. Everyone says so. Even when you were strong, you didn’t dare
try and take over at Hogwarts. Dumbledore saw through you when you were
at school and he still frightens you now, wherever you’re hiding these days

following Dudley’s diet, and he wasn’t going to let Uncle Vernon stop him
from going to the Quidditch World Cup, not if he could help it. Harry took a
deep, steadying breath and then said, “Okay, I can’t see the World Cup. Can I
go now, then? Only I’ve got a letter to Sirius I want to finish. You know —
my godfather.”
He had done it. He had said the magic words. Now he watched the purple
recede blotchily from Uncle Vernon’s face, making it look   Harry bid him
and Hermione good-bye, then wheeled the trolley bearing his trunk and
Hedwig’s cage toward Uncle Vernon, who greeted him in his usual fashion.
“What’s that?” he snarled, staring at the envelope Harry was still clutching
in his hand. “If it’s another form for me to sign, you’ve got another —”
“It’s not,” said Harry cheerfully. “It’s a letter from my godfather.”
“Godfather?” spluttered Uncle Vernon. “You haven’t got a godfather!”
“Yes, I have,” said Harry brightly. “He was my mum and dad’s best ’s boss!” Ron breathed. “Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of
Magic!”
Harry elbowed Ron hard to make him shut up.
Hagrid had gone pale and sweaty. He dropped into one of his chairs and
looked from Dumbledore to Cornelius Fudge.“Bad business, Hagrid,” said Fudge in rather clipped tones. “Very bad
business. Had to come. Four attacks on Muggle-borns. Things’ve gone far
enough. Ministry’s got to act.”
“I never,” said Hagrid, looking imploringly at Dumbledore. “You know I
never, Professor Dumbledore, sir —”

“Well, why not? Harry, there aren’t any real princes in the Wizarding

would make her a ‘half-blood Prince’!”

Who is the gamekeeper at Hogwarts?,Rubeus Hagrid,"Question: Who is the gamekeeper at Hogwarts?
Chain of thought: I know this one! The context doesn't seem to be directly relevant to the question, but it's a passage about Harry, Ron, and Lupin discussing Hagrid's situation. The passage mentions Hagrid's job as gamekeeper at Hogwarts, and I recall that Rubeus Hagrid is the gamekeeper at Hogwarts.

Answer: Rubeus Hagrid.","slowed in Charing Cross Road and stopped
outside the Leaky Cauldron. “I’m to wait for you, any idea how long you’ll

“A couple of hours, I expect,” said Mr. Weasley. “Ah, good, he’s here!”

leapt. There were no Aurors waiting outside the inn, but instead the gigantic,

black-bearded form of Rubeus Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper, wearing a
long beaverskin coat, beaming at the sight of Harry’s face and oblivious to the

Harry had stepped out of the car. “Buckbeak — Witherwings, I mean — yeh
should see him, Harry, he’s so happy ter be back in the open air —”
“Glad he’s pleased,” said Harr art-human Dumbledore employs to teach Care ofMagical Creatures.
Rubeus Hagrid, who admits to being expelled from Hogwarts in
his third year, has enjoyed the position of gamekeeper at the school
ever since, a job secured for him by Dumbledore. Last year,
however, Hagrid used his mysterious influence over the headmaster
to secure the additional post of Care of Magical Creatures teacher,
over the heads of many better-qualified candidates.
An alarmingly large and ferocious-looking man, Hagrid has been
using his  So did the witch; a load of fingernails cascaded down
over her feet and she cursed as the massive form of Hagrid, the Hogwarts
gamekeeper, came striding toward them, beetle-black eyes flashing over his
great bristling beard.
“Hagrid!” Harry croaked in relief. “I was lost — Floo powder —”
Hagrid seized Harry by the scruff of the neck and pulled him away from
the witch, knocking the tray right out of her hands. Her shrieks followed them
all the way along the twisting alleyway out into bright sunlight. Harry  sort of servant, isn’t he?”
“He’s the gamekeeper,” said Harry. He was liking the boy less and less
every second.
“Yes, exactly. I heard he’s a sort of 
savage
 — lives in a hut on the school
grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up
setting fire to his bed.”
“I think he’s brilliant,” said Harry coldly.
“
Do
 you?” said the boy, with a slight sneer. “Why is he with you? Where
are your parents?”
“They’re dead,” said Harry shortly. He didn’t feel much like going into the
matt ists.) Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper, had
obliged with a sack full of his own homemade rock cakes. (Harry hadn’t
touched these; he had had too much experience of Hagrid’s cooking.) Mrs.
Weasley, however, had sent the family owl, Errol, with an enormous fruitcake
and assorted meat pies. Poor Errol, who was elderly and feeble, had needed a
full five days to recover from the journey. And then on Harry’s birthday(which the Dursleys had completely ignored) he had received four superb
birthday cakes, one each f field; two Beaters, who
were equipped with heavy bats to repel the Bludgers (two heavy black balls
that zoomed around trying to attack the players); a Keeper, who defended the
goalposts, and the Seeker, who had the hardest job of all, that of catching the
Golden Snitch, a tiny, winged, walnut-sized ball, whose capture ended the
game and earned the Seeker’s team an extra one hundred and fifty points.Oliver Wood was a burly seventeen-year-old, now in his seventh and final
year at Hogwarts. There was a quiet s"
What position does Harry play on his Quidditch team?,Seeker,"Chain of thought: The context is talking about Harry's Quidditch team, and McLaggen is mentioned, who is also a Quidditch player. Harry is discussing the upcoming match and McLaggen's potential role as Keeper.

Answer: Harry does not play Keeper on his Quidditch team.","look like he’ll be fit for next
week’s match.”
It took Harry a few moments to realize what McLaggen was talking about.
“Oh . . . right . . . Quidditch,” he said, putting his wand back into the belt of
his jeans and running a hand wearily through his hair. “Yeah . . . he might not
make it.”
“Well, then, I’ll be playing Keeper, won’t I?” said McLaggen.
“Yeah,” said Harry. “Yeah, I suppose so. . . .”
He could not think of an argument against it; after all, McLaggen had
certainly performed second-best in the tr ditch, the most popular sport in the magical world — highly
dangerous, very exciting, and played on broomsticks. Harry happened to be a
very good Quidditch player; he had been the youngest person in a century to
be picked for one of the Hogwarts House teams. One of Harry’s most prized
possessions was his Nimbus Two Thousand racing broom.
Harry put the leather case aside and picked up his last parcel. He
recognized the untidy scrawl on the brown paper at once: This was from
Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper. H rs windows defrosting broomsticks on the Quidditch field, bundled up
in a long moleskin overcoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous beaverskin
boots.
The Quidditch season had begun. On Saturday, Harry would be playing in
his first match after weeks of training: Gryffindor versus Slytherin. If
Gryffindor won, they would move up into second place in the House
Championship.
Hardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood had decided that, as
their secret weapon, Harry should be kept, well, secret. But the news th t my father, he has to deal
with Muggle business all the time. My brother Charlie was always more of an
outdoor type, so he went for Care of Magical Creatures. Play to your
strengths, Harry.”
But the only thing Harry felt he was really good at was Quidditch. In the
end, he chose the same new subjects as Ron, feeling that if he was lousy at
them, at least he’d have someone friendly to help him.Gryffindor’s next Quidditch match would be against Hufflepuff. Wood was
insisting on team practices every night afte uidditch; he was rapidly
becoming obsessed with Draco Malfoy. Still checking the Marauder’s Map
whenever he got a chance, he sometimes made detours to wherever Malfoy
happened to be, but had not yet detected him doing anything out of the
ordinary. And still there were those inexplicable times when Malfoy simply
vanished from the map. . . .
But Harry did not get a lot of time to consider the problem, what with
Quidditch practice, homework, and the fact that he was now being dogged
wherever he went by Cormac  ay on the Quidditch team . . .”
“Yeah, that’s right,” said Ron in a heartened tone. “And we 
have 
got plenty
of time to do it all . . .”
Harry glanced over to his right as they approached the Quidditch pitch, to
where the trees of the Forbidden Forest were swaying darkly. Nothing flew
out of them; the sky was empty but for a few distant owls fluttering around
the Owlery Tower. He had enough to worry about; the flying horse wasn’t
doing him any harm: He pushed it out of his mind.
They collected balls from t he start of October, however, Harry had something else to occupy him,
something so enjoyable it more than made up for his unsatisfactory classes.
The Quidditch season was approaching, and Oliver Wood, Captain of the
Gryffindor team, called a meeting one Thursday evening to discuss tactics for
the new season.
There were seven people on a Quidditch team: three Chasers, whose job it
was to score goals by putting the Quaffle (a red, soccer-sized ball) through
one of the fifty-foot-high hoops at each end of the  , but he had another reason for not
wanting Snape near him while he was playing Quidditch. . . .
The rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of
practice, but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common room,
where he found Ron and Hermione playing chess. Chess was the only thing
Hermione ever lost at, something Harry and Ron thought was very good for
her.
“Don’t talk to me for a moment,” said Ron when Harry sat down next to
him, “I need to concen —” He caught sight of H"
Who is the ghost of Gryffindor House?,Nearly Headless Nick,"Chain of thought: The context is describing the scene in the Great Hall, and the Gryffindor ghost is mentioned as sitting next to the students. The description of the ghost's appearance is also given, mentioning a pearly white and semitransparent figure dressed in a doublet with a large ruff.

Answer: The ghost of Gryffindor House is Nearly Headless Nick.","k, the Gryffindor
House ghost, and Parvati Patil and Lavender Brown, the last two of whom
gave Harry airy, overly friendly greetings that made him quite sure they had
stopped talking about him a split second before. He had more important
things to worry about, however: He was looking over the students’ heads to
the staff table that ran along the top wall of the Hall.
“He’s not there.”
Ron and Hermione scanned the staff table too, though there was no real
need; Hagrid’s size made him instantly obvious in any the Slytherins, the Ravenclaws,
and the Hufflepuffs, and sat down with the rest of the Gryffindors at the farside of the Hall, next to Nearly Headless Nick, the Gryffindor ghost. Pearly
white and semitransparent, Nick was dressed tonight in his usual doublet, but
with a particularly large ruff, which served the dual purpose of looking extra-
festive, and insuring that his head didn’t wobble too much on his partially
severed neck.
“Good evening,” he said, beaming at them.
“Says who?” said Harry, taking off h s or
siblings. . . .
Harry caught sight of a pearly white figure drifting across the entrance hall
below and yelled as loudly as he could over the clamor.
“Nick! NICK! I need to talk to you!”
He forced his way back through the tide of students, finally reaching the
bottom of the stairs, where Nearly Headless Nick, ghost of Gryffindor Tower,
stood waiting for him.
“Harry! My dear boy!”Nick made to grasp Harry’s hands with both of his own: Harry’s felt as
though they had been thrust into icy water.
“Nick, you ked and started pushing
one another in their efforts to get out of the line of fire. Harry looked up and
saw, floating twenty feet above them, Peeves the Poltergeist, a little man in a
bell-covered hat and orange bow tie, his wide, malicious face contorted withconcentration as he took aim again.
“PEEVES!” yelled an angry voice. “Peeves, come down here at ONCE!”

House, had come dashing out of the Great Hall; she skidded on the wet floor
and gra  an entertainment provided by the Hogwarts ghosts.
They popped out of the walls and tables to do a bit of formation gliding;
Nearly Headless Nick, the Gryffindor ghost, had a great success with a
reenactment of his own botched beheading.
It had been such a pleasant evening that Harry’s good mood couldn’t even
be spoiled by Malfoy, who shouted through the crowd as they all left the hall,
“The dementors send their love, Potter!”Harry, Ron, and Hermione followed the rest of the Gryffindors along the
usual path I have no idea,” said Nearly Headless Nick. “Of course, it lives in
Dumbledore’s office, so I daresay it picks things up there.”
“And it wants all the Houses to be friends?” said Harry, looking over at the
Slytherin table, where Draco Malfoy was holding court. “Fat chance.”
“Well, now, you shouldn’t take that attitude,” said Nick reprovingly.
“Peaceful cooperation, that’s the key. We ghosts, though we belong to
separate Houses, maintain links of friendship. In spite of the competitiveness

“Harry! My dear boy!”Nick made to grasp Harry’s hands with both of his own: Harry’s felt as
though they had been thrust into icy water.
“Nick, you’ve got to help me. Who’s the ghost of Ravenclaw Tower?”
Nearly Headless Nick looked surprised and a little offended.
“The Gray Lady, of course; but if it is ghostly services you require — ?”
“It’s got to be her — d’you know where she is?”
“Let’s see. . .  licious.
“That does look good,” said the ghost in the ruff sadly, watching Harry cut
up his steak.
“Can’t you — ?”

And they marched off through the crowd of curious Muggles, out of the

Ron unlocked the cavernous trunk with a series of taps from his wand.

discernible only when they moved, shimmering insubstantially on the
gleaming air.Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny filed into seats at the end of a row beside

“I know you’re not,” said Harry and he grinned. But as Hermione and Ron
dragged their trunks, Crookshanks, and a caged Pigwidgeon off toward the

on the Hogwarts Express without Ron.
“Come on,” Ginny told him, “if we get a move on we’ll be able to save

“Right,” said Harry, picking up Hedwig’s sort of householdy spells.
Right — got everything? Cauldron? Broom? Wow! A 
Firebolt
?”
Her eyes widened as they fell on the broomstick in Harry’s right hand. It
was his pride and joy, a gift from Sirius, an international standard broomstick.
“And I’m still riding a Comet Two Sixty,” said Tonks enviously. “Ah
well . . . wand still in your jeans? Both buttocks still on? Okay, let’s go.
Locomotor Trunk.
”
Harry’s trunk rose a few inches into the air. Holding her wand like a
conductor’s baton, Tonks made it ho o go to Hogwarts.”
Uncle Vernon grunted again.
“Would it be all right if you gave me a lift?”
Grunt. Harry supposed that meant yes.
“Thank you.”
He was about to go back upstairs when Uncle Vernon actually spoke.
“Funny way to get to a wizards’ school, the train. Magic carpets all got
punctures, have they?”
Harry didn’t say anything.
“Where is this school, anyway?”
“I don’t know,” said Harry, realizing this for the first time. He pulled the
ticket Hagrid had given him out of his pocket.
“I just take the trai eks beforehand. A limited number use Muggle
transport, but we can’t have too many clogging up their buses and trains —
remember, wizards are coming from all over the world. Some Apparate, of
course, but we have to set up safe points for them to appear, well away from
Muggles. I believe there’s a handy wood they’re using as the Apparition
point. For those who don’t want to Apparate, or can’t, we use Portkeys.
They’re objects that are used to transport wizards from one spot to another at
a prearranged time. Y o eleven. Mr. Weasley dashed
across the road to get trolleys for their trunks and they all hurried into the
station.
Harry had caught the Hogwarts Express the previous year. The tricky part
was getting onto platform nine and three-quarters, which wasn’t visible to theMuggle eye. What you had to do was walk through the solid barrier dividing
platforms nine and ten. It didn’t hurt, but it had to be done carefully so that
none of the Muggles noticed you vanishing.
“Percy first,” said Mrs. Weasley, looking nerv"
What is the name of the house elf who serves the Malfoy family?,Dobby,"chain of thought: The context is discussing the Malfoy family and a house-elf who serves them. I remember that Dobby is a house-elf who was bound to serve the Malfoy family, but Harry set him free. I'm guessing the house-elf who serves the Malfoy family is Dobby, but I'm not sure if there's another one mentioned in the text.

Answer: Dobby."," Malfoy made Dudley Dursley look like a kind,
thoughtful, and sensitive boy.
“I don’t know whether the Malfoys own a house-elf. . . .” said Harry.
“Well, whoever owns him will be an old Wizarding family, and they’ll be
rich,” said Fred.
“Yeah, Mum’s always wishing we had a house-elf to do the ironing,” said
George. “But all we’ve got is a lousy old ghoul in the attic and gnomes all
over the garden. House-elves come with big old manors and castles and
places like that; you wouldn’t catch one in our house. .   wizard family Dobby serves, sir. . . . Dobby is a house-elf — bound to
serve one house and one family forever. . . .”
“Do they know you’re here?” asked Harry curiously.
Dobby shuddered.
“Oh, no, sir, no . . . Dobby will have to punish himself most grievously for
coming to see you, sir. Dobby will have to shut his ears in the oven door for
this. If they ever knew, sir —”
“But won’t they notice if you shut your ears in the oven door?”
“Dobby doubts it, sir. Dobby is always having to punish himself for
someth -elf, as Harry’s friend Dobby
had been. Harry had set Dobby free from his old owners, the Malfoy family.
“Did sir just call me Dobby?” squeaked the elf curiously from between its
fingers. Its voice was higher even than Dobby’s had been, a teeny, quivering
squeak of a voice, and Harry suspected — though it was very hard to tell with
a house-elf — that this one might just be female. Ron and Hermione spunaround in their seats to look. Though they had heard a lot about Dobby from
Harry, they had never actually   wishing we had a house-elf to do the ironing,” said
George. “But all we’ve got is a lousy old ghoul in the attic and gnomes all
over the garden. House-elves come with big old manors and castles and
places like that; you wouldn’t catch one in our house. . . .”Harry was silent. Judging by the fact that Draco Malfoy usually had the
best of everything, his family was rolling in wizard gold; he could just see
Malfoy strutting around a large manor house. Sending the family servant to
stop Harry from going back t  wearily to Harry. “I’m no
great shakes at languages; I need Barty Crouch for this sort of thing. Ah, I see
his house-elf’s saving him a seat. . . . Good job too, these Bulgarian blighters
have been trying to cadge all the best places . . . ah, and here’s Lucius!”
Harry, Ron, and Hermione turned quickly. Edging along the second row to
three still-empty seats right behind Mr. Weasley were none other than Dobby
the house-elf’s former owners: Lucius Malfoy; his son, Draco; and a woman
Harry supposed must be Dr r
to a house-elf!”
“Yeah, we don’t need to hear about you being in love with Malfoy,” Harry
told Kreacher. “Let’s fast forward to where he’s actually been going.”
Kreacher bowed again, looking furious, and then said, “Master Malfoy eats
in the Great Hall, he sleeps in a dormitory in the dungeons, he attends his
classes in a variety of —”
“Dobby, you tell me,” said Harry, cutting across Kreacher. “Has he been
going anywhere he shouldn’t have?”
“Harry Potter, sir,” squeaked Dobby, his great orblike eyes shini  Winky the house-elf
was fighting her way out of a clump of bushes nearby. She was moving in a
most peculiar fashion, apparently with great difficulty; it was as though
someone invisible were trying to hold her back.
“There is bad wizards about!” she squeaked distractedly as she leaned
forward and labored to keep running. “People high — high in the air! Winky
is getting out of the way!”
And she disappeared into the trees on the other side of the path, panting and
squeaking as she fought the force that was r ous.
“We has your extra food!” squeaked an elf at Harry’s elbow, and he shoved
a large ham, a dozen cakes, and some fruit into Harry’s arms. “Good-bye!”
The house-elves crowded around Harry, Ron, and Hermione and began
shunting them out of the kitchen, many little hands pushing in the smalls of
their backs.
“Thank you for the socks, Harry Potter!” Dobby called miserably from the
hearth, where he was standing next to the lumpy tablecloth that was Winky.
“You couldn’t keep your mouth shut, could you, Hermione"
Who is the Half-Blood Prince?,Severus Snape,"chain of thought: The Half-Blood Prince is a mysterious character who used to attend Hogwarts, and Harry has his old Potions book. Hermione suggests that the name could refer to someone who is half-blood, either because of a mixed Muggle and wizarding parentage or because of a nickname. Lupin seems puzzled by the name, and Harry is trying to get a reaction out of him.

Answer: The Half-Blood Prince is actually Severus Snape, who is revealed to have a Muggle father and a pure-blood mother.",".
“There are no Wizarding princes,” said Lupin, now smiling. “Is this a title
you’re thinking of adopting? I should have thought being ‘the Chosen One’
would be enough.”
“It’s nothing to do with me!” said Harry indignantly. “The Half-Blood
Prince is someone who used to go to Hogwarts, I’ve got his old Potions book.
He wrote spells all over it, spells he invented. One of them was Levicorpus
—”
“Oh, that one had a great vogue during my time at Hogwarts,” said Lupin
reminiscently. “There were a few months in m hink 
she
 was the Half-Blood . . . ? Oh, come on.”
“Well, why not? Harry, there aren’t any real princes in the Wizarding
world! It’s either a nickname, a made-up title somebody’s given themselves,
or it could be their actual name, couldn’t it? No, listen! If, say, her father wasa wizard whose surname was Prince, and her mother was a Muggle, then that
would make her a ‘half-blood Prince’!”
“Yeah, very ingenious, Hermione . . .”
“But it would! Maybe she was proud of being half a Prince!”
“Listen, Hermione, I n of his father had reminded him that there was something he
had been looking forward to asking Lupin.
“Have you ever heard of someone called the Half-Blood Prince?”
“The Half-Blood what?”
“Prince,” said Harry, watching him closely for signs of recognition.
“There are no Wizarding princes,” said Lupin, now smiling. “Is this a title
you’re thinking of adopting? I should have thought being ‘the Chosen One’
would be enough.”
“It’s nothing to do with me!” said Harry indignantly. “The Half-Blood
Prince is someon n birth to a —”
“— murderer,” spat Harry.
“Well . . . yes,” said Hermione. “So . . . I was sort of right. Snape must have
been proud of being ‘half a Prince,’ you see? Tobias Snape was a Muggle
from what it said in the 
Prophet.
”
“Yeah, that fits,” said Harry. “He’d play up the pure-blood side so he could
get in with Lucius Malfoy and the rest of them. . . . He’s just like Voldemort.

would make her a ‘half-blood Prince’!”
“Yeah, very ingenious, Hermione . . .”
“But it would! Maybe she was proud of being half a Prince!”
“Listen, Hermione, I can tell it’s not a girl. I can just tell.”
“The truth is that you don’t think a girl would have been clever enough,”
said Hermione angrily.
“How can I have hung round with you for five years and not think girls are
clever?” said Harry, stung by this. “It from the Half-Blood Prince than Snape or Slughorn have taught
me in —”
“I’m not talking about your stupid so-called Prince,” said Hermione, giving
his book a nasty look as though it had been rude to her. “I’m talking about
earlier. I went into the girls’ bathroom just before I came in here and there
were about a dozen girls in there, including that Romilda Vane, trying to
decide how to slip you a love potion. They’re all hoping they’re going to get
you to take them to Slughorn’s party, and they all seem to  arry. “He’d play up the pure-blood side so he could

have missed — ?”
He broke off, looking out the window. He could not stop himself dwelling
upon Dumbledore’s inexcusable trust in Snape . . . but as Hermione had he wasn’t much of a looker,” said Ron. Hermione ignored him.
“I was going through the rest of the old 
Prophets
 and there was a tiny
announcement about Eileen Prince marrying a man called Tobias Snape, and
then later an announcement saying that she’d given birth to a —”
“— murderer,” spat Harry.
“Well . . . yes,” said Hermione. “So . . . I was sort of right. Snape must have

What is the spell to summon objects?,Accio,"Chain of thought: The context is about the Summoning Charm, and Hermione is discussing the spell with Harry. The spell is mentioned earlier in the passage, and it's ""Accio"".

Answer: The spell to summon objects is ""Accio"".","Summoning Charm.
“That’s better, Harry, that’s loads better,” Hermione said, looking exhausted
but very pleased.
“Well, now we know what to do next time I can’t manage a spell,” Harry
said, throwing a rune dictionary back to Hermione, so he could try again,
“threaten me with a dragon. Right . . .” He raised his wand once more. 
“Accio
Dictionary!”
The heavy book soared out of Hermione’s hand, flew across the room, and
Harry caught it.
“Harry, I really think you’ve got it!” said Hermione delightedly.
“Just a y empty.
At two o’clock in the morning, Harry stood near the fireplace, surrounded
by heaps of objects: books, quills, several upturned chairs, an old set of
Gobstones, and Neville’s toad, Trevor. Only in the last hour had Harry really
got the hang of the Summoning Charm.
“That’s better, Harry, that’s loads better,” Hermione said, looking exhausted
but very pleased.
“Well, now we know what to do next time I can’t manage a spell,” Harry
said, throwing a rune dictionary back to Hermione, so he could try again y, pointing the wand’s beam at it. This looked
like some kind of enchantment. He wondered whether he might be able to
blast it out of the way.
“Reducto!”
 he said.
The spell shot straight through the mist, leaving it intact. He supposed he
should have known better; the Reductor Curse was for solid objects. What
would happen if he walked through the mist? Was it worth chancing it, or
should he double back?
He was still hesitating when a scream shattered the silence.
“Fleur?” Harry yelled.
There was silence.  sort of householdy spells.
Right — got everything? Cauldron? Broom? Wow! A 
Firebolt
?”
Her eyes widened as they fell on the broomstick in Harry’s right hand. It
was his pride and joy, a gift from Sirius, an international standard broomstick.
“And I’m still riding a Comet Two Sixty,” said Tonks enviously. “Ah
well . . . wand still in your jeans? Both buttocks still on? Okay, let’s go.
Locomotor Trunk.
”
Harry’s trunk rose a few inches into the air. Holding her wand like a
conductor’s baton, Tonks made it ho agic?” he repeated in a whisper.“That’s right,” said Dumbledore.
“It’s . . . it’s magic, what I can do?”
“What is it that you can do?”
“All sorts,” breathed Riddle. A flush of excitement was rising up his neck
into his hollow cheeks; he looked fevered. “I can make things move without
touching them. I can make animals do what I want them to do, without
training them. I can make bad things happen to people who annoy me. I can
make them hurt if I want to.”
His legs were trembling. He stumbled forward and sat d  to cast their Patronuses: Luna, Ernie, and
Seamus.
“That’s right,” said Luna encouragingly, as if they were back in the Room
of Requirement and this was simply spell practice for the D.A. “That’s right,
Harry . . . come on, think of something happy. . . .”
“Something happy?” he said, his voice cracked.
“We’re all still here,” she whispered, “we’re still fighting. Come on,
now. . . .”
There was a silver spark, then a wavering light, and then, with the greatest
effort it had ever cost him, the stag burst fro  object that Harry had seen before: It
looked something like a silver cigarette lighter, but it had, he knew, the power
to suck all light from a place, and restore it, with a simple click. Scrimgeour
leaned forward and passed the Deluminator to Ron, who took it and turned it
over in his fingers, looking stunned.
“That is a valuable object,” said Scrimgeour, watching Ron. “It may even
be unique. Certainly it is of Dumbledore’s own design. Why would he have
left you an item so rare?”
Ron shook his head, looki es, I’m sure it is. The question is, how do
we get to it?”
“We couldn’t . . . we couldn’t just try a Summoning Charm?” Harry said,
sure that it was a stupid suggestion. But he was much keener than he was
prepared to admit on getting out of this place as soon as possible.
“Certainly we could,” said Dumbledore, stopping so suddenly that Harry
almost walked into him. “Why don’t you do it?”
“Me? Oh . . . okay . . .”
Harry had not expected this, but cleared his throat and said loudly, wand
aloft, 
“Accio Horcrux"
Who is the defense against the dark arts teacher in Harry's first year?,Quirinus Quirrell,"Chain of thought: I need to find the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher in Harry's first year... I've read the passage and it seems that Professor Lupin had resigned last year, and there's no new face at the staff table... Ah, but what about the part where they're discussing the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher?

Answer: Professor Quirrell is not mentioned in this passage, but it's implied that there's a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, and it's not Professor Lupin.","was still fighting his way across the
lake with the first years; Professor McGonagall was presumably supervisingthe drying of the entrance hall floor, but there was another empty chair too,
and Harry couldn’t think who else was missing.
“Where’s the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher?” said Hermione,
who was also looking up at the teachers.
They had never yet had a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher who had
lasted more than three terms. Harry’s favorite by far had been Professor
Lupin, who had res he teaches?” said Ron, frowning at Professor Lupin’s pallid
profile.
“That’s obvious,” whispered Hermione. “There’s only one vacancy, isn’t
there? Defense Against the Dark Arts.”
Harry, Ron, and Hermione had already had two Defense Against the Dark
Arts teachers, both of whom had lasted only one year. There were rumors that
the job was jinxed.
“Well, I hope he’s up to it,” said Ron doubtfully. “He looks like one good
hex would finish him off, doesn’t he? Anyway . . .” He turned to Harry.
“What were you goin fense Against the Dark Arts teacher?” said Hermione,
who was also looking up at the teachers.
They had never yet had a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher who had
lasted more than three terms. Harry’s favorite by far had been Professor
Lupin, who had resigned last year. He looked up and down the staff table.
There was definitely no new face there.
“Maybe they couldn’t get anyone!” said Hermione, looking anxious.
Harry scanned the table more carefully. Tiny little Professor Flitwick, the
Charms teacher, wa ganization.”
“He’s the best Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher we’ve ever had,” said
Dean Thomas boldly, and there was a murmur of agreement from the rest of
the class. Snape looked more menacing than ever.
“You are easily satisfied. Lupin is hardly overtaxing you — I would expect
first years to be able to deal with Red Caps and grindylows. Today we shall
discuss —”
Harry watched him flick through the textbook, to the very back chapter,
which he must know they hadn’t covered.
“— werewolves,” said Snape.
 .
“Looks like they’re heading for the Forbidden Forest. . . .”
And Ron looked even unhappier about that.
At the end of the lesson Professor Sprout escorted the class to their Defense
Against the Dark Arts lesson. Harry and Ron lagged behind the others so they
could talk out of earshot.
“We’ll have to use the Invisibility Cloak again,” Harry told Ron. “We can
take Fang with us. He’s used to going into the forest with Hagrid, he might be
some help.”
“Right,” said Ron, who was twirling his wand nervously in hi e,” said Lupin. “I tried to follow him, but was thrown back just like
Neville. . . .”“He must have known a spell we didn’t,” whispered McGonagall. “After
all — he was the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. . . . I just assumed
that he was in a hurry to chase after the Death Eaters who’d escaped up to the
tower. . . .”
“He was,” said Harry savagely, “but to help them, not to stop them . . . and
I’ll bet you had to have a Dark Mark to get through that barrier — so what
happened when he came back down?”
“W Against the Dark Arts this afternoon.”
“Oh yes,” said Hermione vaguely, but she packed all the books back into
her bag just the same. “I hope there’s something good for lunch, I’m
starving,” she added, and she marched off toward the Great Hall.
“D’you get the feeling Hermione’s not telling us something?” Ron asked
Harry.
Professor Lupin wasn’t there when they arrived at his first Defense Against
the Dark Arts lesson. They all sat down, took out their books, quills, and
parchment, and were talking when he fi in a position
of power.”
“Which job did he want, sir? What subject did he want to teach?”Somehow, Harry knew the answer even before Dumbledore gave it.
“Defense Against the Dark Arts. It was being taught at the time by an old
professor by the name of Galatea Merrythought, who had been at Hogwarts
for nearly fifty years.
“So Voldemort went off to Borgin and Burkes, and all the staff who had
admired him said what a waste it was, a brilliant young wizard like that,
working in a shop. However, Voldemort was no "
What is the name of the three-headed dog that guards the Philosopher's Stone?,Fluffy,"Chain of thought: I need to recall the context and the story to find the answer. The context is about the Philosopher's Stone, and the story is about Harry, Ron, and Hermione's adventure to find it. They mention a three-headed dog that guards the Stone...

Answer: Fluffy!"," around looking for it, Snape, who already suspected me, went
straight to the third floor to head me off — and not only did my troll fail to
beat you to death, that three-headed dog didn’t even manage to bite Snape’s
leg off properly.
“Now, wait quietly, Potter. I need to examine this interesting mirror.”
It was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell. It
was the Mirror of Erised.
“This mirror is the key to finding the Stone,” Quirrell murmured, tapping
his way around the frame. “Tru ious. “Yer not still lookin’
fer Nicolas Flamel, are yeh?”
“Oh, we found out who he is ages ago,” said Ron impressively. “
And
 we
know what that dog’s guarding, it’s a Sorcerer’s St —”
“Shhhh!”
 Hagrid looked around quickly to see if anyone was listening.
“Don’ go shoutin’ about it, what’s the matter with yeh?”
“There are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a matter of fact,” said
Harry, “about what’s guarding the Stone apart from Fluffy —”
“SHHHH!” said Hagrid again. “Listen — come an’ see me later, I’m  knew you’d seen me coming to look at what was guarding
the Stone.”
“
You
 let the troll in?”
“Certainly. I have a special gift with trolls — you must have seen what I
did to the one in the chamber back there? Unfortunately, while everyone else
was running around looking for it, Snape, who already suspected me, went
straight to the third floor to head me off — and not only did my troll fail to
beat you to death, that three-headed dog didn’t even manage to bite Snape’s
leg off properly.
“Now, wait quietly, P meeting the three-
headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were quite keen to have
another one. In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the package that
seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot
of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection.
“It’s either really valuable or really dangerous,” said Ron.
“Or both,” said Harry.
But as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was
about two inches long, they didn’t have much a nightmare — this was too much, on top of everything
that had happened so far.
They weren’t in a room, as he had supposed. They were in a corridor. The
forbidden corridor on the third floor. And now they knew why it was
forbidden.
They were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a dog thatfilled the whole space between ceiling and floor. It had three heads. Three
pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching and quivering in their
direction; three drooling mouths, saliva hanging in slipper ring what to tell
him. Harry decided on the truth.
“I found out something about him,” he told Hagrid. “He tried to get past
that three-headed dog on Halloween. It bit him. We think he was trying to
steal whatever it’s guarding.”
Hagrid dropped the teapot.
“How do you know about Fluffy?” he said.
“Fluffy?”
“Yeah — he’s mine — bought him off a Greek chappie I met in the pub las’
year — I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the —”
“Yes?” said Harry eagerly.
“Now, don’t ask me anymore,” said Hagrid gruffly. “That’s ht into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a dog thatfilled the whole space between ceiling and floor. It had three heads. Three
pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching and quivering in their
direction; three drooling mouths, saliva hanging in slippery ropes from
yellowish fangs.
It was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and Harry knew that
the only reason they weren’t already dead was that their sudden appearance
had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over that, there wa lows was on that stone! Gaunt said he was
descended from the Peverells!”
“A minute ago you told us you never saw the mark on the stone properly!”“Where d’you reckon the ring is now?” Ron asked Harry. “What did
Dumbledore do with it after he broke it open?”
But Harry’s imagination was racing ahead, far beyond Ron and
Hermione’s. . . .
Three objects, or Hallows, which, if united, will make the possessor master
of Death . . . Master . . . Conqueror . . . Vanquisher . . . The last enemy that

What creature is Aragog?,Acromantula,"Chain of thought: Okay, I need to think about what creature Aragog is. I know that Aragog is a creature that is feared by spiders, and it's something that Hagrid has had for years. I also know that Aragog is a talking creature, which is unusual for the wizarding world. Based on the context, I'm going to take a guess that Aragog is an Acromantula, which is a type of giant spider.

Answer: Aragog is an Acromantula.","pes shifted all around him.
“The thing that lives in the castle,” said Aragog, “is an ancient creature we
spiders fear above all others. Well do I remember how I pleaded with Hagrid
to let me go, when I sensed the beast moving about the school.”
“What is it?” said Harry urgently.
More loud clicking, more rustling; the spiders seemed to be closing in.
“We do not speak of it!” said Aragog fiercely. “We do not name it! I never
even told Hagrid the name of that dread creature, though he asked me, many
times.”
H agrid to the hilt, so I’m
sure he can’t be up to anything very dreadful. . . .”
“Well, it’s this giant spider, he’s had it for years. . . . It lived in the
forest. . . . It could talk and everything —”
“I heard rumors there were acromantulas in the forest,” said Slughorn
softly, looking over at the mass of black trees. “It’s true, then?”
“Yes,” said Harry. “But this one, Aragog, the first one Hagrid ever got, it
died last night. He’s devastated. He wants company while he buries it and I
said I’d go.”
“Touch Aragog would have liked most about
Slughorn was the ample amount of edible flesh he provided, but he merely
moved to the rear window of Hagrid’s hut, where he saw the rather horrible
sight of the enormous dead spider lying on its back outside, its legs curled and
tangled.
“Are we going to bury him here, Hagrid, in your garden?”
“Jus’ beyond the pumpkin patch, I thought,” said Hagrid in a choked voice.
“I’ve already dug the — yeh know — grave. Jus’ thought we’d say a few nice
things over him — happy memories Aragog.”
“Aragog,” said Harry and Hagrid together.
Both Slughorn and Hagrid drank deeply. Harry, however, with the way
ahead illuminated for him by Felix Felicis, knew that he must not drink, so he
merely pretended to take a gulp and then set the mug back on the table before
him.
“I had him from an egg, yeh know,” said Hagrid morosely. “Tiny little
thing he was when he hatched. ’Bout the size of a Pekingese.”
“Sweet,” said Slughorn.
“Used ter keep him in a cupboard up at the school until . . . well . . .”
H  with his brutal giant of a half-brother,
but this was perhaps the most incomprehensible of all his monster fancies: the
gigantic talking spider, Aragog, who dwelled deep in the Forbidden Forest
and which he and Ron had only narrowly escaped four years previously.
“Is there — is there anything we can do?” Hermione asked, ignoring Ron’s
frantic grimaces and head-shakings.
“I don’ think there is, Hermione,” choked Hagrid, attempting to stem the
flood of his tears. “See, the rest o’ the tribe . . . Aragog’s fa  the misty, domed web, a spider the size of a small
elephant emerged, very slowly. There was gray in the black of his body and
legs, and each of the eyes on his ugly, pincered head was milky white. He was
blind.
“What is it?” he said, clicking his pincers rapidly.
“Men,” clicked the spider who had caught Harry.
“Is it Hagrid?” said Aragog, moving closer, his eight milky eyes wandering
vaguely.
“Strangers,” clicked the spider who had brought Ron.
“Kill them,” clicked Aragog fretfully. “I was sleeping. . . .” trous Aragog had once lived. The remnants of his vast
web were there still, but the swarm of descendants he had spawned had been
driven out by the Death Eaters, to fight for their cause.
A fire burned in the middle of the clearing, and its flickering light fell over
a crowd of completely silent, watchful Death Eaters. Some of them were still
masked and hooded; others showed their faces. Two giants sat on the outskirts
of the group, casting massive shadows over the scene, their faces cruel,
rough-hewn like r gog, king of arachnids, whose
long and faithful friendship those who knew you won’t forget! Though your
body will decay, your spirit lingers on in the quiet, web-spun places of your
forest home. May your many-eyed descendants ever flourish and your human
friends find solace for the loss they have sustained.”“Tha’ was . . . tha’ was . . . beau’iful!” howled Hagrid, and he collapsed
onto the compost heap, crying harder than ever.
“There, there,” said Slughorn, waving his wand so that the huge pile of
earth ro"
Who does Harry marry?,Ginny Weasley,"Chain of thought: I've read the provided context, and it seems that the topic of marriage is being discussed. The conversation is about Ginny Weasley and her potential marriage to someone. The text mentions Mrs. Weasley, Hermione, and Ginny avoiding each other's gaze, which suggests that the marriage might be related to one of them. However, the conversation is not explicitly about Harry's marriage.

Answer: Based on the context, it seems that the question is asking about Harry's marriage. However, the text does not explicitly state who Harry marries."," “You are 
so
 like Ron —”
“— and he said he’d come to see her off! And then he told me to go away.
He’s 
snogging 
her!” James added as though worried he had not made himself
clear.
“Oh, it would be lovely if they got married!” whispered Lily ecstatically.
“Teddy would 
really 
be part of the family then!”
“He already comes round for dinner about four times a week,” said Harry.
“Why don’t we just invite him to live with us and have done with it?”
“Yeah!” said James enthusiastically. “I don’t mind sharing w ing to be married!”“Oh,” said Harry blankly. He could not help noticing how Mrs. Weasley,
Hermione, and Ginny were all determinedly avoiding one another’s gaze.
“Wow. Er — congratulations!”
She swooped down upon him and kissed him again.
“Bill is very busy at ze moment, working very ’ard, and I only work part-
time at Gringotts for my Eenglish, so he brought me ’ere for a few days to get
to know ’is family properly. I was so pleased to ’ear you would be coming —
zere isn’t much to do ’ere, unless you like c at he really is going to marry
her,” sighed Ginny later that evening, as she, Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat
beside the open window of the Gryffindor common room, looking out over
the twilit grounds.
“She’s not that bad,” said Harry. “Ugly, though,” he added hastily, as Ginny
raised her eyebrows, and she let out a reluctant giggle.
“Well, I suppose if Mum can stand it, I can.”
“Anyone else we know died?” Ron asked Hermione, who was perusing the
Evening Prophet.
Hermione winced at the forced toughness in his v er, and anyone who’s pretending different’s kidding
themselves. It’ll never be safe for you here, Potter, he wants you too badly. So
go abroad, go into hiding, save yourself. Best take these two with you.” He
jerked a thumb at Ron and Hermione. “They’ll be in danger long as they live
now everyone knows they’ve been working with you.”
“I can’t leave,” said Harry. “I’ve got a job —”
“Give it to someone else!”
“I can’t. It’s got to be me, Dumbledore explained it all —”
“Oh, did he now? And did he tell you ever ld up a hand to silence her.
“She was really cut up when you ended it —”“So was I. You know why I stopped it, and it wasn’t because I wanted to.”
“Yeah, but you go snogging her now and she’s just going to get her hopes
up again —”
“She’s not an idiot, she knows it can’t happen, she’s not expecting us to —
to end up married, or —”
As he said it, a vivid picture formed in Harry’s mind of Ginny in a white
dress, marrying a tall, faceless, and unpleasant stranger. In one spiraling
moment it seemed to hit him: H at he now had a great
liking for very rare steaks.
“. . . so eet ees lucky ’e is marrying me,” said Fleur happily, plumping up
Bill’s pillows, “because ze British overcook their meat, I ’ave always said
this.”
“I suppose I’m just going to have to accept that he really is going to marry
her,” sighed Ginny later that evening, as she, Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat
beside the open window of the Gryffindor common room, looking out over
the twilit grounds.
“She’s not that bad,” said Harry. “Ugly, though,” he added est. “They prefer the woman’s touch,
unicorns. Girls to the front, and approach with care, come on, easy does
it. . . .”
She and the girls walked slowly forward toward the unicorn, leaving the
boys standing near the paddock fence, watching. The moment Professor
Grubbly-Plank was out of earshot, Harry turned to Ron.
“What d’you reckon’s wrong with him? You don’t think a skrewt — ?”
“Oh he hasn’t been attacked, Potter, if that’s what you’re thinking,” said
Malfoy softly. “No, he’s just too ashamed to show his knows it can’t happen, she’s not expecting us to —
to end up married, or —”
As he said it, a vivid picture formed in Harry’s mind of Ginny in a white
dress, marrying a tall, faceless, and unpleasant stranger. In one spiraling
moment it seemed to hit him: Her future was free and unencumbered, whereas
his . . . he could see nothing but Voldemort ahead.
“If you keep groping her every chance you get —”
“It won’t happen again,” said Harry harshly. The day was cloudless, but he
felt as though the sun had gone in."
What are the names of Harry's children?,"James, Albus, and Lily","Question: What are the names of Harry's children?
Chain of thought: The context is about Harry's family and his children. The passage mentions Harry's wife (a pureblood) and their seven children, with two of the youngest at Hogwarts. The youngest son is currently at home, seriously ill, and is being monitored by the Ministry. The passage also mentions ""Undesirable No. 1"" who is likely to contact Harry's family.

Answer: The passage does not explicitly mention the names of Harry's children, but it does mention that he has seven children, with two of the youngest at Hogwarts."," STATUS:
Pureblood, but with unacceptable pro-Muggle
leanings. Known member of the Order of the
Phoenix.
FAMILY:
Wife (pureblood), seven children, two youngest at
Hogwarts. NB: Youngest son currently at home,seriously ill, Ministry inspectors have confirmed.
SECURITY STATUS:
TRACKED. All movements are being monitored.
Strong likelihood Undesirable No. 1 will contact (has
stayed with Weasley family previously)
“Undesirable Number One,” Harry muttered under his breath as he
replaced Mr. Weasley’s folder and s hink 
she
 was the Half-Blood . . . ? Oh, come on.”
“Well, why not? Harry, there aren’t any real princes in the Wizarding
world! It’s either a nickname, a made-up title somebody’s given themselves,
or it could be their actual name, couldn’t it? No, listen! If, say, her father wasa wizard whose surname was Prince, and her mother was a Muggle, then that
would make her a ‘half-blood Prince’!”
“Yeah, very ingenious, Hermione . . .”
“But it would! Maybe she was proud of being half a Prince!”
“Listen, Hermione, I turned a page loudly, and Dumbledore’s name leapt out at him. It was a
moment or two before he took in the meaning of the photograph, which
showed a family group. Beneath the photograph were the words:
 The
Dumbledore family, left to right: Albus; Percival, holding newborn Ariana;
Kendra; and Aberforth.
His attention caught, Harry examined the picture more carefully.
Dumbledore’s father, Percival, was a good-looking man with eyes that
seemed to twinkle even in this faded old photograph. The baby, Ariana, wa

Mrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. Dursley wondered
whether he dared tell her he’d heard the name “Potter.” He decided he didn’tdare. Instead he said, as casually as he could, “Their son — he’d be about
Dudley’s age now, wouldn’t he?”
“I suppose so,” said Mrs. Dursley stiffly.
“What’s his name again? Howard, isn’t it?”
“Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.”
“Oh, yes,” said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. “Yes, I quite agree.”
He didn’t say another wo is
was taken, they got her whole family. That’s Frank and Alice Longbottom —”
Harry’s stomach, already uncomfortable, clenched as he looked at Alice
Longbottom; he knew her round, friendly face very well, even though he had
never met her, because she was the image of her son, Neville.
“Poor devils,” growled Moody. “Better dead than what happened to
them . . . and that’s Emmeline Vance, you’ve met her, and that there’s Lupin,
obviously . . . Benjy Fenwick, he copped it too, we only ever found bits of

and followed by the twins, Fred and George, who were about to start their
fifth year at Hogwarts; the newly elected Head Boy, Percy; and the Weasleys’
youngest child and only girl, Ginny.
Ginny, who had always been very taken with Harry, seemed even more
heartily embarrassed than usual when she saw him, perhaps because he had
saved her life during their previous year at Hogwarts. She went very red and
muttered “Hello” without looking at him. Percy, h as though they
were ever any help to him awake. Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and Dudley
were Harry’s only living relatives. They were Muggles who hated and
despised magic in any form, which meant that Harry was about as welcome in
their house as dry rot. They had explained away Harry’s long absences at
Hogwarts over the last three years by telling everyone that he went to St.
Brutus’s Secure Center for Incurably Criminal Boys. They knew perfectly
well that, as an underage wizard, Harry wasn’t allowed to use   and a couple of family heirlooms that he
treasured just as much as his son, and rather more than his daughter.”
“So Merope,” said Harry, leaning forward in his chair and staring at
Dumbledore, “so Merope was . . . Sir, does that mean she was . . . 
Voldemort’s
mother
?”
“It does,” said Dumbledore. “And it so happens that we also had a glimpse
of Voldemort’s father. I wonder whether you noticed?”
“The Muggle Morfin attacked? The man on the horse?”
“Very good indeed,” said Dumbledore, beaming. “Yes, that was"
What is the name of the wand shop in Diagon Alley?,Ollivanders,"Chain of thought: The context is about Diagon Alley, and the story is mentioning Ollivander's Wand Shop, which is a well-known wand shop in the wizarding world. I recall that Ollivander's Wand Shop is indeed located in Diagon Alley.

Answer: The name of the wand shop in Diagon Alley is Ollivander's Wand Shop.",". He was a good man,
Florean.”
“Talking of Diagon Alley,” said Mr. Weasley, “looks like Ollivander’s gone
too.”
“The wandmaker?” said Ginny, looking startled.
“That’s the one. Shop’s empty. No sign of a struggle. No one knows
whether he left voluntarily or was kidnapped.”
“But wands — what’ll people do for wands?”
“They’ll make do with other makers,” said Lupin. “But Ollivander was the
best, and if the other side have got him it’s not so good for us.”
The day after this rather gloomy birthday tea, their let le eyes standing quietly by the window. Harry had met Mr.
Ollivander before — he was the wandmaker from whom Harry had bought
his own wand over three years ago in Diagon Alley.
“Mademoiselle Delacour, could we have you first, please?” said Mr.Ollivander, stepping into the empty space in the middle of the room.
Fleur Delacour swept over to Mr. Ollivander and handed him her wand.
“Hmmm . . .” he said.
He twirled the wand between his long fingers like a baton and it emitted a
number of pink and gold sparks. Th cabbers was looking thinner than usual, and there was a definite droop to
his whiskers.
“There’s a magical creature shop just over there,” said Harry, who knew
Diagon Alley very well by now. “You could see if they’ve got anything for
Scabbers, and Hermione can get her owl.”
So they paid for their ice cream and crossed the street to the Magical
Menagerie.
There wasn’t much room inside. Every inch of wall was hidden by cages. It
was smelly and very noisy because the occupants of these cages were all
squeaking bledore, taking his place at the
judges’ table and talking to the champions. “He will be checking your wands
to ensure that they are in good condition before the tournament.”
Harry looked around, and with a jolt of surprise saw an old wizard with
large, pale eyes standing quietly by the window. Harry had met Mr.
Ollivander before — he was the wandmaker from whom Harry had bought
his own wand over three years ago in Diagon Alley.
“Mademoiselle Delacour, could we have you first, please?” said Mr.Ollivander, s  thick woollen balaclava.
After breakfast Harry would go out into the backyard, take out his wand,
tap the third brick from the left above the trash bin, and stand back as the
archway into Diagon Alley opened in the wall.
Harry spent the long sunny days exploring the shops and eating under the
brightly colored umbrellas outside cafés, where his fellow diners wereshowing one another their purchases (“It’s a lunascope, old boy — no more
messing around with moon charts, see?”) or else discussing the case of Si Tom look surprised.
“Too polite,” Harry whispered in Hermione’s ear as they passed out of the
inn into the tiny backyard. “You need to treat people like they’re scum!”“Okay, okay!”
Hermione drew out Bellatrix’s wand and tapped a brick in the nondescript
wall in front of them. At once the bricks began to whirl and spin: A hole
appeared in the middle of them, which grew wider and wider, finally forming
an archway onto the narrow cobbled street that was Diagon Alley.
It was quiet, barely time for the shops to  e entrance
and paused, looking around.
Diagon Alley had changed. The colorful, glittering window displays of
spellbooks, potion ingredients, and cauldrons were lost to view, hidden behind
the large Ministry of Magic posters that had been pasted over them. Most of
these somber purple posters carried blown-up versions of the security advice
on the Ministry pamphlets that had been sent out over the summer, but others
bore moving black-and-white photographs of Death Eaters known to be on
the loose. Bellatrix Le  the country, up for a day’s

Who is the head of Slytherin House?,Severus Snape,"Chain of thought: The context is discussing the Sorting Ceremony and the four Houses at Hogwarts. It mentions Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin, and that each House has its own head.

Answer: The head of Slytherin House is Professor Snape.","and Ron. They finally managed to
find their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast without getting lost once.
“What have we got today?” Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar on his
porridge.
“Double Potions with the Slytherins,” said Ron. “Snape’s Head of Slytherin
House. They say he always favors them — we’ll be able to see if it’s true.”
“Wish McGonagall favored us,” said Harry. Professor McGonagall was
head of Gryffindor House, but it hadn’t stopped her from giving them a huge
pile of homework the day bef  . . . Minerva, go and head her off —
tell her any story —”
Professor McGonagall was gone in a swish of tartan.
“He says he’ll be delighted,” said a bored voice behind Dumbledore; the
wizard called Phineas had reappeared in front of his Slytherin banner. “My
great-great-grandson has always had odd taste in houseguests . . .”
“Come here, then,” Dumbledore said to Harry and the Weasleys. “And
quickly, before anyone else joins us . . .”
Harry and the others gathered around Dumbledore’s desk.
“You have all used ded up in Gryffindor, along with Ron, Hermione,
and the rest of the Weasleys. Last term, Harry and Ron had helped Gryffindor
win the House Championship, beating Slytherin for the first time in seven
years.
A very small, mousy-haired boy had been called forward to place the hat on
his head. Harry’s eyes wandered past him to where Professor Dumbledore, the
headmaster, sat watching the Sorting from the staff table, his long silver beard
and half-moon glasses shining brightly in the candlelight. Several seats a  you are here, your House will be something like
your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your
House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free time in your House

Slytherin. Each House has its own noble history and each has produced
outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs
will earn your House points, while any rule-breaking will lose House points.
At the end of the us,
you know. Charming girl. I used to tell her she ought to have been in my
House. Very cheeky answers I used to get back too.”
“Which was your House?”
“I was Head of Slytherin,” said Slughorn. “Oh, now,” he went on quickly,
seeing the expression on Harry’s face and wagging a stubby finger at him,
“don’t go holding that against me! You’ll be Gryffindor like her, I suppose?
Yes, it usually goes in families. Not always, though. Ever heard of Sirius
Black? You must have done — been in the papers for the last  considered putting 
him
 in Slytherin. He could remember, as though it were
yesterday, the small voice that had spoken in his ear when he’d placed the hat
on his head a year before: 
You could be great, you know, it’s all here in your
head, and Slytherin would help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about
that. . . .
But Harry, who had already heard of Slytherin House’s reputation forturning out Dark wizards, had thought desperately, 
Not Slytherin!
 and the hat
had said, 
Oh, well, if you’re sure . . .   withconcentration as he took aim again.
“PEEVES!” yelled an angry voice. “Peeves, come down here at ONCE!”
Professor McGonagall, deputy headmistress and Head of Gryffindor
House, had come dashing out of the Great Hall; she skidded on the wet floor
and grabbed Hermione around the neck to stop herself from falling.
“Ouch — sorry, Miss Granger —”
“That’s all right, Professor!” Hermione gasped, massaging her throat.
“Peeves, get down here NOW!” barked Professor McGonagall,
straightening her pointed hat and gla . .
“You all know, of course, that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years
ago — the precise date is uncertain — by the four greatest witches and

They built this castle together, far from prying Muggle eyes, for it was an age
when magic was feared by common people, and witches and wizards suffered
much persecution.”

What potion grants good luck?,Felix Felicis,"Question: What potion grants good luck?
Chain of thought: I've been provided with a passage from the Harry Potter series, specifically a scene from the Potions class where Professor Slughorn is discussing the Draught of Peace, but then reveals that the students are actually going to be making Felix Felicis, a potion that grants good luck.

Answer: Felix Felicis is the potion that grants good luck.","e to expect from my O.W.L. students.
“Today we will be mixing a potion that often comes up at Ordinary

agitation. Be warned: If you are too heavy-handed with the ingredients you
will put the drinker into a heavy and sometimes irreversible sleep, so you will

sat up a little straighter, her expression one of the utmost attentiveness. “The

“Yes. That. Well,

who had let out an audible gasp, “that you know what Felix Felicis does, Miss
Granger?”
“It’s liquid luck,” said Hermione excitedly. “It makes you lucky!”
The whole class seemed to sit up a little straighter. Now all Harry could see

Aragog without us.”
“Yes, he will,” said Hermione, looking relieved. “Look, Potions will be
almost empty this afternoon, with us all off doing our tests. . . . Try and soften
Slughorn up a bit then!”
“Fifty-seventh time lucky, you think?” said Harry bitterly.
“Lucky,” said Ron suddenly. “Harry, that’s it — get lucky!”
“What d’you mean?”
“Use your lucky potion!”
“Ron, that’s — that’s it!” said Hermione, sounding stunned. “Of course!
Why didn’t I think of it?”
Harry stared at them bot 
He pocketed the potion again.
“There really wasn’t anything in my pumpkin juice?” Ron said, astounded.
“But the weather’s good . . . and Vaisey couldn’t play. . . . I honestly haven’t
been given lucky potion?”
Harry shook his head. Ron gaped at him for a moment, then rounded on
Hermione, imitating her voice. “
You added Felix Felicis to Ron’s juice this
morning, that’s why he saved everything!
 See! I can save goals without help,
Hermione!”
“I never said you couldn’t — Ron,

 thought you’d been given i morning. It was full of golden potion and the cork was still tightly
sealed with wax. “I wanted Ron to think I’d done it, so I faked it when I knew
you were looking.” He looked at Ron. “You saved everything because you felt
lucky. You did it all yourself.”
He pocketed the potion again.
“There really wasn’t anything in my pumpkin juice?” Ron said, astounded.
“But the weather’s good . . . and Vaisey couldn’t play. . . . I honestly haven’t

Harry shook his head. Ron gaped at him for a   in Ron’s cauldron. He passed over
Ernie’s navy concoction. Hermione’s potion he gave an approving nod. Then
he saw Harry’s, and a look of incredulous delight spread over his face.
“The clear winner!” he cried to the dungeon. “Excellent, excellent, Harry!
Good lord, it’s clear you’ve inherited your mother’s talent. She was a dab
hand at Potions, Lily was! Here you are, then, here you are — one bottle of
Felix Felicis, as promised, and use it well!”
Harry slipped the tiny bottle of golden liquid into his inn as still
keeping his bottle of lucky potion, Felix Felicis.“Right,” he murmured, taking it back to bed with him, tapping it quietly
and murmuring, 
“I solemnly swear that I am up to no good,”
 so that Neville,
who was passing the foot of his bed at the time, would not hear.
“Nice one, Harry!” said Ron enthusiastically, waving the new pair of
Quidditch Keeper’s gloves Harry had given him.
“No problem,” said Harry absentmindedly, as he searched the Slytherin
dormitory closely for Malfoy. “Hey . . . I don’t th putation for Potions brilliance you don’t deserve,” said
Hermione nastily.

“There,” said Lupin, sticking his own wand back into his belt. “You’re

Harry didn’t know what to think. Was it a trick?
“If you haven’t been helping him,” he said, with a furious glance at Black,
“how did you know he was here?”
“The map,” said Lupin. “The Marauder’s Map. I was in my office
examining it —”

“What is this thing?” said Moody, drawing the Marauder’s Map out of his
pocket and unfolding it.
“Map of Hogwarts,” said Harry, hoping Moody was going to pull him out
of the staircase soon; his leg was really hurting him.
“Merlin’s beard,” Moody whispered, staring at the map, his magical eye
going haywire. “This . . . this is some map, Potter!”

from the pain. “Er — Professor  precaution, Harry thought he

slowed down, coming to a halt halfway along an empty passage, where he sat
down upon the plinth of a departed statue and pulled the Marauder’s Map out
of the pouch around his neck. He could not see Ron’s or Hermione’s namesanywhere on it, though the density of the crowd of dots now making its way
to the Room of Requirement might, he thought, be concealing them. He put
the map away, pressed his hands over his face, an Invisibility Cloak and
throwing it over both of them. He gave the wall a little push.
It melted away at his touch and they slipped outside: Harry glanced back
and saw that it had resealed itself at once. They were standing in a dark
corridor: Harry pulled Luna back into the shadows, fumbled in the pouch
around his neck, and took out the Marauder’s Map. Holding it close to his
nose he searched, and located his and Luna’s dots at last.

Who is the Triwizard champion from Beauxbatons?,Fleur Delacour,"Question: Who is the Triwizard champion from Beauxbatons?
Chain of thought: I remember that the Triwizard Tournament is a competition between three schools: Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, and Durmstrang. Each school selects a champion to represent them. In the book, we are introduced to the champions, and I recall that the champion from Beauxbatons is... Fleur Delacour!

Answer: Fleur Delacour.","
do
 know will forgive me
for giving a short explanation, and allow their attention to wander freely.
“The Triwizard Tournament was first established some seven hundred years
ago as a friendly competition between the three largest European schools of
wizardry: Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, and Durmstrang. A champion was selected
to represent each school, and the three champions competed in three magical
tasks. The schools took it in turns to host the tournament once every five
years, and it was generally agreed to of them were.
There was a sound of scurrying feet behind him, and Ludo Bagman entered
the room. He took Harry by the arm and led him forward.“Extraordinary!” he muttered, squeezing Harry’s arm. “Absolutely
extraordinary! Gentlemen . . . lady,” he added, approaching the fireside and
addressing the other three. “May I introduce — incredible though it may seem
— the 
fourth
 Triwizard champion?”
Viktor Krum straightened up. His surly face darkened as he surveyed
Harry. Cedric looked nonplussed. He looked from  directions, to station themselves around the maze. Bagman now
pointed his wand at his throat, muttered, 
“Sonorus,”
 and his magically
magnified voice echoed into the stands.
“Ladies and gentlemen, the third and final task of the Triwizard
Tournament is about to begin! Let me remind you how the points currently
stand! Tied in first place, with eighty-five points each — Mr. Cedric Diggory
and Mr. Harry Potter, both of Hogwarts School!” The cheers and applause
sent birds from the Forbidden Forest fluttering i for over a century. It is my very great pleasure to inform
you that the Triwizard Tournament will be taking place at Hogwarts this
year.”
“You’re JOKING!” said Fred Weasley loudly.
The tension that had filled the Hall ever since Moody’s arrival suddenly
broke. Nearly everyone laughed, and Dumbledore chuckled appreciatively.
“I am 
not
 joking, Mr. Weasley,” he said, “though now that you mention it, I

“I’m going for it!” Fred Weasley hissed down the table, his face lit with
enthusiasm at the prospect of such glory and riches. He was not the only
person who seemed to be visualizing himself as the Hogwarts champion. At
every House table, Harry coul r seats, their goblets untouched.Dumbledore, who after all possessed no magical eye, did not see them.
When everyone had once again resumed their seats, Dumbledore
continued, “The Triwizard Tournament’s aim was to further and promote
magical understanding. In the light of what has happened — of Lord
Voldemort’s return — such ties are more important than ever before.”
Dumbledore looked from Madame Maxime and Hagrid, to Fleur Delacour

another attempt. We have worked hard over the summer to ensure that this

What is Voldemort's real name?,Tom Riddle,"Chain of thought: I've seen this conversation before... I remember Dumbledore mentioning Tom Riddle... Ah, yes! Tom Riddle was Voldemort's real name before he became the Dark Lord.

Answer: Tom Riddle.","id Voldemort. “But I want there to be no
mistake in anybody’s mind. Harry Potter escaped me by a lucky chance. And
I am now going to prove my power by killing him, here and now, in front of
you all, when there is no Dumbledore to help him, and no mother to die for
him. I will give him his chance. He will be allowed to fight, and you will be
left in no doubt which of us is the stronger. Just a little longer, Nagini,” he
whispered, and the snake glided away through the grass to where the Death
Eaters stood wa -Who.’ I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying
Voldemort’s name.”
“I know you haven’t,” said Professor McGonagall, sounding half
exasperated, half admiring. “But you’re different. Everyone knows you’re the
only one You-Know- oh, all right, 
Voldemort,
 was frightened of.”
“You flatter me,” said Dumbledore calmly. “Voldemort had powers I will
never have.”
“Only because you’re too — well — 
noble
 to use them.”
“It’s lucky it’s dark. I haven’t blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told
me she li that Lord Voldemort was once called Tom Riddle. I
taught him myself, fifty years ago, at Hogwarts. He disappeared after leaving
the school . . . traveled far and wide . . . sank so deeply into the Dark Arts,
consorted with the very worst of our kind, underwent so many dangerous,
magical transformations, that when he resurfaced as Lord Voldemort, he was
barely recognizable. Hardly anyone connected Lord Voldemort with the
clever, handsome boy who was once Head Boy here.”
“But, Ginny,” said Mrs. Weasley. “What self an impressive new
name — 
Lord
 Voldemort — the Half-Blood 
Prince —
 how could Dumbledore
have missed — ?”
He broke off, looking out the window. He could not stop himself dwelling
upon Dumbledore’s inexcusable trust in Snape . . . but as Hermione had just
inadvertently reminded him, he, Harry, had been taken in just the same. . . . Inspite of the increasing nastiness of those scribbled spells, he had refused to
believe ill of the boy who had been so clever, who had helped him so
much. . . .
Helped him  said. “These days, I am known
as —”
“I know what you are known as,” said Dumbledore, smiling pleasantly.
“But to me, I’m afraid, you will always be Tom Riddle. It is one of the
irritating things about old teachers. I am afraid that they never quite forget
their charges’ youthful beginnings.”
He raised his glass as though toasting Voldemort, whose face remained
expressionless. Nevertheless, Harry felt the atmosphere in the room change
subtly: Dumbledore’s refusal to use Voldemort’s chosen name was a refusal  eleven years I have
been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name: 
Voldemort.
”
Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two
lemon drops, seemed not to notice. “It all gets so confusing if we keep saying
‘You-Know-Who.’ I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying
Voldemort’s name.”
“I know you haven’t,” said Professor McGonagall, sounding half
exasperated, half admiring. “But you’re different. Everyone knows you’re the
only one You-Know- oh, all right,  rs of his name rearranged
themselves:
I AM LORD VOLDEMORT
“You see?” he whispered. “It was a name I was already using at Hogwarts,
to my most intimate friends only, of course. You think I was going to use my
filthy Muggle father’s name forever? I, in whose veins runs the blood of
Salazar Slytherin himself, through my mother’s side? I, keep the name of a
foul, common Muggle, who abandoned me even before I was born, just
because he found out his wife was a witch? No, Harry — I fashioned myself a
new name, a n n his long,
crooked nose at its burnt and soggy pages.
“Brilliant,” he said softly. “Of course, he was probably the most brilliantstudent Hogwarts has ever seen.” He turned around to the Weasleys, who
were looking utterly bewildered.
“Very few people know that Lord Voldemort was once called Tom Riddle. I
taught him myself, fifty years ago, at Hogwarts. He disappeared after leaving
the school . . . traveled far and wide . . . sank so deeply into the Dark Arts,
consorted with the very worst of our kind, under"
What spell is used to produce light from a wand?,Lumos,"Chain of thought: The context mentions Hermione waving her wand and Ron using the Deluminator, which suggests that the spell being used to produce light is Lumos.

Answer: Lumos.","y had lit went out at once.
“The thing is,” whispered Hermione through the dark, “we could have
achieved that with Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder.”
There was a small 
click,
 and the ball of light from the lamp flew back to the
ceiling and illuminated them all once more.
“Still, it’s cool,” said Ron, a little defensively. “And from what they said,
Dumbledore invented it himself!”
“I know, but surely he wouldn’t have singled you out in his will just to help
us turn out the lights!”“D’you think he knew the  , waving her wand in the direction of the stairs.
“Thought you didn’t approve of that spell?” said Ron.
“Times change,” said Hermione. “Now, show us that Deluminator.”
Ron obliged at once. Holding it up in front of him, he clicked it. The
solitary lamp they had lit went out at once.
“The thing is,” whispered Hermione through the dark, “we could have
achieved that with Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder.”
There was a small 
click,
 and the ball of light from the lamp flew back to the
ceiling and illuminated th bead of light right back into Voldemort’s wand . . . and slowly . . .
very slowly . . . it moved along the golden thread . . . it trembled for a
moment . . . and then it connected. . . .
At once, Voldemort’s wand began to emit echoing screams of pain . . . then
— Voldemort’s red eyes widened with shock — a dense, smoky hand flew out
of the tip of it and vanished . . . the ghost of the hand he had made
Wormtail . . . more shouts of pain . . . and then something much larger began
to blossom from Voldemort’s w  object that Harry had seen before: It
looked something like a silver cigarette lighter, but it had, he knew, the power
to suck all light from a place, and restore it, with a simple click. Scrimgeour
leaned forward and passed the Deluminator to Ron, who took it and turned it
over in his fingers, looking stunned.
“That is a valuable object,” said Scrimgeour, watching Ron. “It may even
be unique. Certainly it is of Dumbledore’s own design. Why would he have
left you an item so rare?”
Ron shook his head, looki — come on —
Lumos!
”
He said the spell automatically, desperate for light to help him in his search
— and to his disbelieving relief, light flared inches from his right hand — the
wand-tip had ignited. Harry snatched it up, scrambled to his feet, and turned
around.
His stomach turned over.
A towering, hooded figure was gliding smoothly toward him, hovering over
the ground, no feet or face visible beneath its robes, sucking on the night as it
came.Stumbling backward, Harry raised his wand.
“Expecto Patronum! e . . . and Lord Voldemort rewards his helpers. . . .”
Voldemort raised his wand again and whirled it through the air. A streak of
what looked like molten silver hung shining in the wand’s wake. Momentarily
shapeless, it writhed and then formed itself into a gleaming replica of a
human hand, bright as moonlight, which soared downward and fixed itself
upon Wormtail’s bleeding wrist.
Wormtail’s sobbing stopped abruptly. His breathing harsh and ragged, he
raised his head and stared in disbelief at the silver h  lighting his own wand hastily as he went.
An eerie sight met their eyes: They were standing on the edge of a great
black lake, so vast that Harry could not make out the distant banks, in a
cavern so high that the ceiling too was out of sight. A misty greenish light
shone far away in what looked like the middle of the lake; it was reflected in
the completely still water below. The greenish glow and the light from the
two wands were the only things that broke the otherwise velvety blackness,
though their ray passed it up and down Harry’s front and back.
“Wand,” grunted the security wizard at Harry, putting down the golden
instrument and holding out his hand.
Harry produced his wand. The wizard dropped it onto a strange brass
instrument, which looked something like a set of scales with only one dish. It
began to vibrate. A narrow strip of parchment came speeding out of a slit in
the base. The wizard tore this off and read the writing upon it.
“Eleven inches, phoenix-feather core, been in use four years. That cor"
What is the name of Hermione's cat?,Crookshanks,"Chain of thought: The context provided is a passage from the Harry Potter book, and it seems to be describing a scene where Hermione's cat, Crookshanks, has transformed into a person. The passage mentions Hermione's cat, but it doesn't explicitly state the cat's name. However, the context provides a description of the cat's appearance, which is ginger, bandy-legged, and has a grumpy face.

Answer: The name of Hermione's cat is Crookshanks.","y had only gone a few paces when Hermione’s bandy-legged ginger
cat, Crookshanks, came pelting out of the garden, bottlebrush tail held high in
the air, chasing what looked like a muddy potato on legs. Harry recognized it
instantly as a gnome. Barely ten inches high, its horny little feet pattered very
fast as it sprinted across the yard and dived headlong into one of the
Wellington boots that lay scattered around the door. Harry could hear the
gnome giggling madly as Crookshanks inserted a paw into the boo  you still got Millicent’s nose or
something?”
Hermione let her robes fall and Ron backed into the sink.
Her face was covered in black fur. Her eyes had turned yellow and there
were long, pointed ears poking through her hair.
“It was a c-cat hair!” she howled. “M-Millicent Bulstrode m-must have a
cat! And the p-potion isn’t supposed to be used for animal transformations!”
“Uh-oh,” said Ron.
“You’ll be teased something 
dreadful
,” said Myrtle happily.
“It’s okay, Hermione,” said Harry quickly. “We’ll take y  Harry. The cat’s ginger fur was thick
and fluffy, but it was definitely a bit bowlegged and its face looked grumpy
and oddly squashed, as though it had run headlong into a brick wall. Now that
Scabbers was out of sight, however, the cat was purring contentedly in
Hermione’s arms.
“Hermione, that thing nearly scalped me!” said Ron.
“He didn’t mean to, did you, Crookshanks?” said Hermione.
“And what about Scabbers?” said Ron, pointing at the lump in his chest
pocket. “He needs rest and relaxation! How’s he g  himself
between them and looking uncharacteristically serious.
“What?” said Harry.
“Hermione,” said Hagrid.
“What about her?” said Ron.
“She’s in a righ’ state, that’s what. She’s bin comin’ down ter visit me a lotsince Chris’mas. Bin feelin’ lonely. Firs’ yeh weren’ talking to her because o’
the Firebolt, now yer not talkin’ to her because her cat —”
“— ate Scabbers!” Ron interjected angrily.
“Because her cat acted like all cats do,” Hagrid continued doggedly. “She’s
cried a fair few times, yeh know. Goin  ! Oh, it’s you,” said Ron in relief, as Harry
entered the room. Ron lay back down on the bed, which he had evidently just
vacated. The room was just as messy as it had been all week; the only change
was that Hermione was now sitting in the far corner, her fluffy ginger cat,
Crookshanks, at her feet, sorting books, some of which Harry recognized as
his own, into two enormous piles.
“Hi, Harry,” she said, as he sat down on his camp bed.
“And how did you manage to get away?”
“Oh, Ron’s mum forgot that she ask led. “M-Millicent Bulstrode m-must have a
cat! And the p-potion isn’t supposed to be used for animal transformations!”
“Uh-oh,” said Ron.
“You’ll be teased something 
dreadful
,” said Myrtle happily.
“It’s okay, Hermione,” said Harry quickly. “We’ll take you up to the
hospital wing. Madam Pomfrey never asks too many questions. . . .”
It took a long time to persuade Hermione to leave the bathroom. Moaning
Myrtle sped them on their way with a hearty guffaw. “Wait till everyone finds
out you’ve got a 
tail
!”H ame out, but she wasn’t carrying an owl. Her
arms were clamped tightly around the enormous ginger cat.
“You 
bought
 that monster?” said Ron, his mouth hanging open.
“He’s 
gorgeous,
 isn’t he?” said Hermione, glowing.
That was a matter of opinion, thought Harry. The cat’s ginger fur was thick
and fluffy, but it was definitely a bit bowlegged and its face looked grumpy
and oddly squashed, as though it had run headlong into a brick wall. Now that
Scabbers was out of sight, however, the cat was purring conten es since I last bought him school robes. Are you hungry, Harry?”
“Yeah, I am,” said Harry, suddenly realizing just how hungry he was.
“Sit down, dear, I’ll knock something up.”
As Harry sat down, a furry ginger cat with a squashed face jumped onto his
knees and settled there, purring.“So Hermione’s here?” he asked happily as he tickled Crookshanks behind
the ears.
“Oh yes, she arrived the day before yesterday,” said Mrs. Weasley, rapping
a large iron pot with her wand. It bounced onto the stove with a loud "
What magical plant does Harry use to breathe underwater in the Triwizard Tournament?,Gillyweed,"Chain of thought: The context is describing a scene where Harry is trying to help Dumbledore breathe underwater in the Triwizard Tournament. The conversation mentions a magical plant, gillyweed, which Dobby gives to Harry. This plant is used to make Harry breathe underwater...

Answer: The magical plant that Harry uses to breathe underwater in the Triwizard Tournament is gillyweed.","s and drew out a ball of what looked like slimy, grayish-
green rat tails. “Right before you go into the lake, sir — gillyweed!”
“What’s it do?” said Harry, staring at the gillyweed.
“It will make Harry Potter breathe underwater, sir!”
“Dobby,” said Harry frantically, “listen — are you sure about this?”
He couldn’t quite forget that the last time Dobby had tried to “help” him,
he had ended up with no bones in his right arm.
“Dobby is quite sure, sir!” said the elf earnestly. “Dobby hears things, sir,
he is   guide Harry Potter through the Triwizard Tournament without
appearing to do so. A servant who would watch over Harry Potter. Ensure he
reached the Triwizard Cup. Turn the Cup into a Portkey, which would take the
first person to touch it to my master. But first —”
“You needed Alastor Moody,” said Dumbledore. His blue eyes were
blazing, though his voice remained calm.
“Wormtail and I did it. We had prepared the Polyjuice Potion beforehand.
We journeyed to his house. Moody put up a struggle. There was a commo  wait — 
Aguamenti!
” said Harry again, pointing his
wand at the goblet. Once more, for a second, clear water gleamed within it,
but as he approached Dumbledore’s mouth, the water vanished again.“Sir, I’m trying, I’m trying!” said Harry desperately, but he did not think
that Dumbledore could hear him; he had rolled onto his side and was drawing
great, rattling breaths that sounded agonizing. 
“Aguamenti — Aguamenti —
AGUAMENTI!”
The goblet filled and emptied once more. And now Dumbledore’s
breathing was fad  around them.
“Stop moving!” Hermione ordered them. “I know what this is — it’s
Devil’s Snare!”
“Oh, I’m so glad we know what it’s called, that’s a great help,” snarled
Ron, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck.
“Shut up, I’m trying to remember how to kill it!” said Hermione.
“Well, hurry up, I can’t breathe!” Harry gasped, wrestling with it as it
curled around his chest.
“Devil’s Snare, Devil’s Snare . . . what did Professor Sprout say? — it likes
the dark and the damp —”
“So d him.
“I’ve got to go and look for people who can’t use their voices above the
ground. . . .” he said slowly. “Er . . . who could that be?”
“Slow, aren’t you?”
He had never seen Moaning Myrtle so cheerful, apart from the day when a
dose of Polyjuice Potion had given Hermione the hairy face and tail of a cat.
Harry stared around the bathroom, thinking . . . if the voices could only be
heard underwater, then it made sense for them to belong to underwater
creatures. He ran this theory past Myrtle, who smirked !”
With a noise like an explosion, something very large and pale erupted out
of the dark water some twenty feet away; before Harry could see what it was,
it had vanished again with a crashing splash that made great, deep ripples on
the mirrored surface. Harry leapt backward in shock and hit the wall; his heart
was still thundering as he turned to Dumbledore.
“What was that?”
“Something, I think, that is ready to respond should we attempt to seize the
Horcrux.”
Harry looked back at the water. The surface of   did not think
that Dumbledore could hear him; he had rolled onto his side and was drawing
great, rattling breaths that sounded agonizing. 
“Aguamenti — Aguamenti —
AGUAMENTI!”
The goblet filled and emptied once more. And now Dumbledore’s
breathing was fading. His brain whirling in panic, Harry knew, instinctively,
the only way left to get water, because Voldemort had planned it so . . .
He flung himself over to the edge of the rock and plunged the goblet into
the lake, bringing it up full to the brim of ic 
 he shouted, jabbing the goblet with his wand.
The goblet filled with clear water; Harry dropped to his knees beside
Dumbledore, raised his head, and brought the glass to his lips — but it was
empty. Dumbledore groaned and began to pant.
“But I had some — wait — 
Aguamenti!
” said Harry again, pointing his
wand at the goblet. Once more, for a second, clear water gleamed within it,
but as he approached Dumbledore’s mouth, the water vanished again.“Sir, I’m trying, I’m trying!” said Harry desperately, but he"
Who killed Dumbledore?,Severus Snape,"chain of thought: I remember this scene where Dumbledore is talking to Harry and Professor McGonagall, and they're discussing the fact that Voldemort couldn't kill Harry. Dumbledore is saying that someone is dead, and then it's revealed that it's him, Dumbledore. The question is asking who killed Dumbledore, and I know the answer...

Answer: Snape killed Dumbledore.","s were directed only at Voldemort, who
had tampered so ill-advisedly with the deepest laws of magic. Only toward
him was that wand abnormally powerful. Otherwise it was a wand like any
other . . . though a good one, I am sure,” Dumbledore finished kindly.Harry sat in thought for a long time, or perhaps seconds. It was very hard to
be sure of things like time, here.
“He killed me with your wand.”
“He 
failed 
to kill you with my wand,” Dumbledore corrected Harry. “I
think we can agree that you are not dead — , Harry. But — he couldn’t. He
couldn’t kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how, but they’re saying that
when he couldn’t kill Harry Potter, Voldemort’s power somehow broke —
and that’s why he’s gone.”
Dumbledore nodded glumly.
“It’s — it’s 
true
?” faltered Professor McGonagall. “After all he’s done . . .
all the people he’s killed . . . he couldn’t kill a little boy? It’s just
astounding . . . of all the things to stop him . . . but how in the name of heaven
did Harry survive?”
“We can only guess,” nd Harry’s heart thundered unheard
in his invisible chest. . . . Someone was dead. . . . Malfoy had stepped over the
body . . . but who was it?
“There is little time, one way or another,” said Dumbledore. “So let us
discuss your options, Draco.”
“
My
 options!” said Malfoy loudly. “I’m standing here with a wand — I’m
about to kill you —”
“My dear boy, let us have no more pretense about that. If you were going to
kill me, you would have done it when you first disarmed me, you would not
have stopped for this  at him, the little of his face that could be seen
completely blank, uncomprehending.
“Dumbledore wha’, Harry?”
“He’s dead. Snape killed him. . . .”
“Don’ say that,” said Hagrid roughly. “Snape kill Dumbledore — don’ be
stupid, Harry. Wha’s made yeh say tha’?”
“I saw it happen.”
“Yeh couldn’ have.”
“I saw it, Hagrid.”
Hagrid shook his head; his expression was disbelieving but sympathetic,
and Harry knew that Hagrid thought he had sustained a blow to the head, that
he was confused, perhaps by the aftereffects until the end. She was buried under my name and
bearing my appearance. Everyone believed her to be me.”
The man’s eyelids flickered.
“And what did your father do with you, when he had got you home?” said
Dumbledore quietly.
“Staged my mother’s death. A quiet, private funeral. That grave is empty.
The house-elf nursed me back to health. Then I had to be concealed. I had to
be controlled. My father had to use a number of spells to subdue me. When I
had recovered my strength, I thought only of finding my maste , you are not a killer.”
“How do you know?” said Malfoy at once.
He seemed to realize how childish the words had sounded; Harry saw him
flush in the Mark’s greenish light.
“You don’t know what I’m capable of,” said Malfoy more forcefully. “You
don’t know what I’ve done!”
“Oh yes, I do,” said Dumbledore mildly. “You almost killed Katie Bell and
Ronald Weasley. You have been trying, with increasing desperation, to kill me
all year. Forgive me, Draco, but they have been feeble attempts. . . . So feeble,
to be  hter, he hoped to discredit Arthur and get rid of a highly incriminating
magical object in one stroke. Ah, poor Lucius . . . what with Voldemort’s fury
about the fact that he threw away the Horcrux for his own gain, and the fiasco
at the Ministry last year, I would not be surprised if he is not secretly glad to
be safe in Azkaban at the moment.”Harry sat in thought for a moment, then asked, “So if all of his Horcruxes
are destroyed, Voldemort 
could
 be killed?”
“Yes, I think so,” said Dumbledore. “Without   screamed Voldemort. “Too weak to dare, too
weak to take what might have been his, what will be mine!”
“No, he was cleverer than you,” said Harry, “a better wizard, a better man.”
“I brought about the death of Albus Dumbledore!”
“You thought you did,” said Harry, “but you were wrong.”
For the first time, the watching crowd stirred as the hundreds of people
around the walls drew breath as one.
“Dumbledore is dead!”
 Voldemort hurled the words at Harry as though
they would cause him unendurable pain. “His bod"
What shape is Harry's scar?,A lightning bolt,"Chain of thought: I've read the passage and I know that Harry's scar is described as being shaped like a bolt of lightning. The passage mentions this multiple times, and it's also mentioned that the scar is the only hint of Harry's mysterious past.

Answer: The shape of Harry's scar is like a bolt of lightning.","was about four times bigger than he was. Harry had a
thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. He wore round
glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley
had punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked about his own
appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt oflightning. He had had it as long as he could remember, and the first question
he could ever remember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it.
“In t lled Harry Potter woke with a start.H
 
CHAPTER  TWO
THE SCAR
arry lay flat on his back, breathing hard as though he had been running.
He had awoken from a vivid dream with his hands pressed over his
face. The old scar on his forehead, which was shaped like a bolt of lightning,
was burning beneath his fingers as though someone had just pressed a white-
hot wire to his skin.
He sat up, one hand still on his scar, the other reaching out in the darkness
for his glasses, which were on the bedside table. He put   with brilliant green eyes and jet-black hair that was
always untidy. He wore round glasses, and on his forehead was a thin,
lightning-shaped scar.
It was this scar that made Harry so particularly unusual, even for a wizard.
This scar was the only hint of Harry’s very mysterious past, of the reason he
had been left on the Dursleys’ doorstep eleven years before.
At the age of one year old, Harry had somehow survived a curse from the
greatest Dark sorcerer of all time, Lord Voldemort, whose name most witches
 scar again. It wasn’t the pain that bothered
him; Harry was no stranger to pain and injury. He had lost all the bones from
his right arm once and had them painfully regrown in a night. The same arm
had been pierced by a venomous foot-long fang not long afterward. Only last
year Harry had fallen fifty feet from an airborne broomstick. He was used to
bizarre accidents and injuries; they were unavoidable if you attended
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and had a knack for attracting a
lot of trouble.  whatever he did to it. The eyes behind his glasses
were bright green, and on his forehead, clearly visible through his hair, was a
thin scar, shaped like a bolt of lightning.
Of all the unusual things about Harry, this scar was the most extraordinary
of all. It was not, as the Dursleys had pretended for ten years, a souvenir of
the car crash that had killed Harry’s parents, because Lily and James Potter
had not died in a car crash. They had been murdered, murdered by the most
feared Dark wizard for a hundr to him was that his scar had
begun to prickle again, although he did all he could to hide this fact from the
other two. He sought solitude whenever it happened, but was disappointed by
what he saw. The visions he and Voldemort were sharing had changed in
quality; they had become blurred, shifting as though they were moving in and
out of focus. Harry was just able to make out the indistinct features of an
object that looked like a skull, and something like a mountain that was more
shadow than substance. Used e lightning scar on Harry’s forehead with a long,
white finger.
“I’m sorry to say I sold the wand that did it,” he said softly. “Thirteen-and-
a-half inches. Yew. Powerful wand, very powerful, and in the wrong
hands . . . well, if I’d known what that wand was going out into the world to
do. . . .”
He shook his head and then, to Harry’s relief, spotted Hagrid.
“Rubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you again. . . . Oak, sixteen
inches, rather bendy, wasn’t it?”
“It was, sir, yes,” said Hagrid.“Good wand, th way.”
He set off at a brisk pace, past an empty inn and a few houses. According
to a clock on a nearby church, it was almost midnight.
“So tell me, Harry,” said Dumbledore. “Your scar . . . has it been hurting at
all?”Harry raised a hand unconsciously to his forehead and rubbed the
lightning-shaped mark.
“No,” he said, “and I’ve been wondering about that. I thought it would be
burning all the time now Voldemort’s getting so powerful again.”
He glanced up at Dumbledore and saw that he was wearing a satisfied"
Who are Harry's parents?,James and Lily Potter,"Chain of thought: I'm reading the context, and I'm looking for any mention of Harry's parents. I see that the chapter is about Harry looking at wizard pictures of his parents, and I remember that his parents were James Potter and Lily Potter.

Answer: Harry's parents are James Potter and Lily Potter.","f wizard pictures of his
mother and father. He sat down on his bed, drew the hangings around him,
and started turning the pages, searching, until . . .
He stopped on a picture of his parents’ wedding day. There was his father
waving up at him, beaming, the untidy black hair Harry had inheritedstanding up in all directions. There was his mother, alight with happiness, arm
in arm with his dad. And there . . . that must be him. Their best man . . . Harry
had never given him a thought before.
If he hadn’t known and ends up
setting fire to his bed.”
“I think he’s brilliant,” said Harry coldly.
“
Do
 you?” said the boy, with a slight sneer. “Why is he with you? Where
are your parents?”
“They’re dead,” said Harry shortly. He didn’t feel much like going into the
matter with this boy.
“Oh, sorry,” said the other, not sounding sorry at all. “But they were 
ourkind, weren’t they?”
“They were a witch and wizard, if that’s what you mean.”
“I really don’t think they should let the other sort in, do you? They’re just
not the Harry. But you see what they’re doing? They want to turn you into someone
nobody will believe. Fudge is behind it, I’ll bet anything. They want wizards
on the street to think you’re just some stupid boy who’s a bit of a joke, who
tells ridiculous tall stories because he loves being famous and wants to keep it
going.”“I didn’t ask — I didn’t want — 
Voldemort killed my parents!
” Harry
spluttered. “I got famous because he murdered my family but couldn’t kill
me! Who wants to be famous for that? Don’t they th oy, flipping the paper over and
holding it up. “A picture of your parents outside their house — if you can call
it a house! Your mother could do with losing a bit of weight, couldn’t she?”
Ron was shaking with fury. Everyone was staring at him.
“Get stuffed, Malfoy,” said Harry. “C’mon, Ron. . . .”
“Oh yeah, you were staying with them this summer, weren’t you, Potter?”
sneered Malfoy. “So tell me, is his mother really that porky, or is it just the
picture?”
“You know 
your
 mother, Malfoy?” said Harry — bot and wizards still feared to speak. Harry’s parents had died in Voldemort’sattack, but Harry had escaped with his lightning scar, and somehow —
nobody understood why — Voldemort’s powers had been destroyed the
instant he had failed to kill Harry.
So Harry had been brought up by his dead mother’s sister and her husband.
He had spent ten years with the Dursleys, never understanding why he kept
making odd things happen without meaning to, believing the Dursleys’ story
that he had got his scar in the car crash t ?” asked Harry, who found Ron just as
interesting as Ron found him.
“Er — yes, I think so,” said Ron. “I think Mum’s got a second cousin
who’s an accountant, but we never talk about him.”
“So you must know loads of magic already.”The Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale boy
in Diagon Alley had talked about.
“I heard you went to live with Muggles,” said Ron. “What are they like?”
“Horrible — well, not all of them. My aunt and uncle and cousin are,
though. Wish I’d had three wiza  then, well, I won’t bother myself about
them. It’s all right for you two, isn’t it, with your parents safely out of the way

“My parents are 
dead
!” Harry bellowed.
“And mine could be going the same way!” yelled Ron.
“Then GO!” roared Harry. “Go back to them, pretend you’ve got over your
spattergroit and Mummy’ll be able to feed you up and —”
Ron made a sudden movement: Harry reacted, but before either wand was

 she cried, and an invis g about Neville’s parents,” said Dumbledore. “His
father, Frank, was an Auror just like Professor Moody. He and his wife were
tortured for information about Voldemort’s whereabouts after he lost his
powers, as you heard.”
“So they’re dead?” said Harry quietly.
“No,” said Dumbledore, his voice full of a bitterness Harry had never heard
there before. “They are insane. They are both in St. Mungo’s Hospital for
Magical Maladies and Injuries. I believe Neville visits them, with his
grandmother, during the holida"
What spell is used to unlock doors?,Alohomora,"Question: What spell is used to unlock doors?
Chain of thought: The context suggests that the spell used to unlock doors is not a specific magical incantation, but rather a technique involving the use of a wand. In the passage, we see Scrimgeour tapping the keyhole with his wand, which causes the lock to click open.

Answer: The spell used to unlock doors is not explicitly stated, but it appears to involve the use of a wand to manipulate the lock mechanism.","
“No problem,” said George from the front passenger seat. “Out of the way,
Harry.”
Fred and George climbed catlike through the window into Harry’s room.
You had to hand it to them, thought Harry, as George took an ordinary hairpinfrom his pocket and started to pick the lock.
“A lot of wizards think it’s a waste of time, knowing this sort of Muggle
trick,” said Fred, “but we feel they’re skills worth learning, even if they are a
bit slow.”
There was a small click and the door swung open.
“So — we’ll get your understood why the Wizarding
community preferred Scrimgeour to Fudge as a leader in these dangerous
times.
“How do you do?” said the Prime Minister politely, holding out his hand.
Scrimgeour grasped it briefly, his eyes scanning the room, then pulled out a
wand from under his robes.
“Fudge told you everything?” he asked, striding over to the door and
tapping the keyhole with his wand. The Prime Minister heard the lock click.
“Er — yes,” said the Prime Minister. “And if you don’t mind, I’d rather

tapping the keyhole with his wand. The Prime Minister heard the lock click.
“Er — yes,” said the Prime Minister. “And if you don’t mind, I’d rather
that door remained unlocked.”
“I’d rather not be interrupted,” said Scrimgeour shortly, “or watched,” he
added, pointing his wand at the windows, so that the curtains swept across
them. “Right, well, I’m a busy man, so let’s get down to business. First of all,

Clankers.
“Make him press his hand to the door!” Griphook urged Harry, who turned
his wand again upon Bogrod. The old goblin obeyed, pressing his palm to the
wood, and the door of the vault melted away to reveal a cavelike opening
crammed from floor to ceiling with golden coins and goblets, silver armor, theskins of strange creatures — some with long spines, others with drooping
wings — potions in jeweled flasks, and a skull still wearing a crown.
“Search, fast!” said Ha ,” said Lockhart, with a shadow of his
old smile. “I’ll just —”
He put his hand on the door knob, but Ron and Harry both pointed their
wands at him.
“You can go first,” Ron snarled.
White-faced and wandless, Lockhart approached the opening.
“Boys,” he said, his voice feeble. “Boys, what good will it do?”
Harry jabbed him in the back with his wand. Lockhart slid his legs into the
pipe.
“I really don’t think —” he started to say, but Ron gave him a push, and he
slid out of sight. Harry followed quickly. He lo e, be reasonable,” said Fudge. “This door’s been locked, we
just saw —”
“THEY HELPED HIM ESCAPE, I KNOW IT!” Snape howled, pointing at
Harry and Hermione. His face was twisted; spit was flying from his mouth.
“Calm down, man!” Fudge barked. “You’re talking nonsense!”
“YOU DON’T KNOW POTTER!” shrieked Snape. “HE DID IT, I KNOW
HE DID IT —”
“That will do, Severus,” said Dumbledore quietly. “Think about what you
are saying. This door has been locked since I left the ward ten minutes ago.
Madam Pomfrey, have th  skull seemed to vibrate with the din. The dragon let out another
hoarse roar, then retreated. Harry could see it trembling, and as they drew
nearer he saw the scars made by vicious slashes across its face, and guessed
that it had been taught to fear hot swords when it heard the sound of the
Clankers.
“Make him press his hand to the door!” Griphook urged Harry, who turned
his wand again upon Bogrod. The old goblin obeyed, pressing his palm to the
wood, and the door of the vault melted away to reveal a cavel anything else, the door flew open again as Harry
had known it would, and there stood Hagrid, glowering down at him and
looking, despite the flowery apron, positively alarming.
“I’m a teacher!” he roared at Harry. “A teacher, Potter! How dare yeh
threaten ter break down my door!”
“I’m sorry, 
sir,
” said Harry, emphasizing the last word as he stowed his
wand inside his robes.
Hagrid looked stunned. “Since when have yeh called me ‘sir’?”
“Since when have you called me ‘Potter’?”
“Oh, very clever,” growled Hag"
What does the Imperius Curse do?,Controls the victim,"Chain of thought: The Imperius Curse is one of the Unforgivable Curses, and it's illegal to use it on a fellow human being. The Curse is used to control someone's actions, making them do things they wouldn't normally do. It's a powerful Curse, and Professor Moody is demonstrating its power by putting it on each of his students in turn.

VIGILANCE!” he roared, and the whole class jumped again.
“Now . . . those three curses — 
Avada Kedavra,
 Imperius, and Cruciatus —
are known as the Unforgivable Curses. The use of any one of them on a
fellow human being is enough to earn a life sentence in Azkaban. That’s what
you’re up against. That’s what I’ve got to teach you to fight. You need
preparing. You need arming. But most of all, you need to practice 
constant,
never-ceasing vigilance.
 Get out your quil ne of your throats . . .”
Ron gave an involuntary shudder.
“Years back, there were a lot of witches and wizards being controlled by
the Imperius Curse,” said Moody, and Harry knew he was talking about the
days in which Voldemort had been all-powerful. “Some job for the Ministry,
trying to sort out who was being forced to act, and who was acting of their
own free will.
“The Imperius Curse can be fought, and I’ll be teaching you how, but it
takes real strength of character, and not everyone’s got it. Better a  wished he still had Quidditch to distract him; nothing workedso well on a troubled mind as a good, hard training session. On the other
hand, their lessons were becoming more difficult and demanding than ever
before, particularly Moody’s Defense Against the Dark Arts.
To their surprise, Professor Moody had announced that he would be putting
the Imperius Curse on each of them in turn, to demonstrate its power and to
see whether they could resist its effects.
“But — but you said it’s illegal, Professor,” said e Dark Arts.
To their surprise, Professor Moody had announced that he would be putting

“But — but you said it’s illegal, Professor,” said Hermione uncertainly as
Moody cleared away the desks with a sweep of his wand, leaving a large clear
space in the middle of the room. “You said — to use it against another human

“Dumbledore wants you taught what it feels like,” said Moody, his magi  to be able to help you with
this, Harry!” said Hermione, more loudly. “There’s only one way to force
someone to do what you want, and that’s the Imperius Curse, which is illegal
—”
“Yeah, I know that, thanks,” said Harry, not looking up from the book.
“That’s why I’m looking for something different. Dumbledore says
Veritaserum won’t do it, but there might be something else, a potion or a
spell. . . .”
“You’re going about it the wrong way,” said Hermione. “Only you can get
the memory, Dumbledore says. That   their Prime Minister gets put under the Imperius Curse. The new
secretary in your outer office —”
“I’m not getting rid of Kingsley Shacklebolt, if that’s what you’re
suggesting!” said the Prime Minister hotly. “He’s highly efficient, gets
through twice the work the rest of them —”
“That’s because he’s a wizard,” said Scrimgeour, without a flicker of a
smile. “A highly trained Auror, who has been assigned to you for your
protection.”
“Now, wait a moment!” declared the Prime Minister. “You can’t just put
you the Imperius Curse lift. Once he’d got his
voice back, he’d explain what he’d been doing, wouldn’t he? They would
have known he’d been sent to steal the weapon. Of course, it would have been
easy for Lucius Malfoy to put the curse on him. Never out of the Ministry, is
he?”
“He was even hanging around that day I had my hearing,” said Harry. “In
the — hang on . . .” he said slowly. “He was in the Department of Mysteries
corridor that day! Your dad said he was probably trying to sneak down and
find out what ha an you should have in that maze tonight, of
course,” said Moody. “I was patrolling around it, able to see through the outer
hedges, able to curse many obstacles out of your way. I Stunned Fleur
Delacour as she passed. I put the Imperius Curse on Krum, so that he would
finish Diggory and leave your path to the Cup clear.”
Harry stared at Moody. He just didn’t see how this could be. . . .

Who teaches Transfiguration at Hogwarts?,Minerva McGonagall,"Chain of thought: The passage mentions different teachers and their personalities, but only one teacher is specifically mentioned as teaching Transfiguration. That teacher is...

Answer: Professor McGonagall.","different. Harry had been quite right to
think she wasn’t a teacher to cross. Strict and clever, she gave them a talking-
to the moment they sat down in her first class.
“Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you
will learn at Hogwarts,” she said. “Anyone messing around in my class will
leave and not come back. You have been warned.”
Then she changed her desk into a pig and back again. They were all very
impressed and couldn’t wait to get started, but soon realized they weren’t

stand on a pile of books to see over his desk. At the start of their first class he
took the roll call, and when he reached Harry’s name he gave an excited
squeak and toppled out of sight.
Professor McGonagall was again different. Harry had been quite right to
think she wasn’t a teacher to cross. Strict and clever, she gave them a talking-
to the moment they sat down in her first class.
“Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you
will learn at Hog ng Secrecy — it
was too much to hope that no Muggles would spot an Aqua-Lung zooming
across the countryside to Hogwarts.
“Of course, the ideal solution would be for you to Transfigure yourself into
a submarine or something,” Hermione said. “If only we’d done human
Transfiguration already! But I don’t think we start that until sixth year, and it
can go badly wrong if you don’t know what you’re doing. . . .”
“Yeah, I don’t fancy walking around with a periscope sticking out of my
head,” said Harry. “I s’pose I d the brains, or the power!
“Only the Transfiguration teacher, Dumbledore, seemed to think Hagrid
was innocent. He persuaded Dippet to keep Hagrid and train him as
gamekeeper. Yes, I think Dumbledore might have guessed. . . . Dumbledore
never seemed to like me as much as the other teachers did. . . .”
“I bet Dumbledore saw right through you,” said Harry, his teeth gritted.
“Well, he certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on me after Hagrid was
expelled,” said Riddle carelessly. “I knew it wouldn’t be safe particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into
something else, of course, it’s supposed to be very difficult —”; “You’ll be
starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing —”).
Harry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at the High
Table again. Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet. Professor
McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore. Professor Quirrell, in his
absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked no Gonagall closed her eyes for a moment, opened them again, and
continued as though nothing had happened.
“I would also advise Transfiguration, because Aurors frequently need to
Transfigure or Untransfigure in their work. And I ought to tell you now,
Potter, that I do not accept students into my N.E.W.T. classes unless they have
achieved ‘Exceeds Expectations’ or higher at Ordinary Wizarding Level. I’d
say you’re averaging ‘Acceptable’ at the moment, so you’ll need to put in
some good hard work before the exa sor McGonagall,
Transfiguration teacher and head of Gryffindor House, was calling over the
heads of the crowd. She was a stern-looking witch who wore her hair in a
tight bun; her sharp eyes were framed with square spectacles. Harry fought
his way over to her with a feeling of foreboding: Professor McGonagall had a
way of making him feel he must have done something wrong.“There’s no need to look so worried — I just want a word in my office,”
she told them. “Move along there, Weasley.”
Ron stared as Professor ne human

can go badly wrong if you don’t know what you’re doing. . . .”
“Yeah, I don’t fancy walking around with a periscope sticking out of my

he might do it for me. . . .”
“I don’t think he’d let you choose what you wanted to be turned into,

glutinous liquid splattered onto the office floor.
“Polyjuice Potion, Harry,” said Dumbledore. “You see the simplicity of it,and the brilliance. For Moody never 
does
 drink except from his hip flask, he’s
well known for it. The imposter needed, of course, to keep the real Moody
close by, so that he could continue making the potion. You see his hair . . .”
Dumbledore looked down on the Moody in the trunk. “The imposter has been
cutting it off all year, see where it is uneven? But I think, in . It was clear from a glance why it belongedin the Restricted Section. Some of the potions had effects almost too
gruesome to think about, and there were some very unpleasant illustrations,
which included a man who seemed to have been turned inside out and a witch
sprouting several extra pairs of arms out of her head.
“Here it is,” said Hermione excitedly as she found the page headed 
The
Polyjuice Potion.
 It was decorated with drawings of people halfway through
transforming into other people. Harry sincer at her.
“It’s Veritaserum, a colorless, odorless potion that forces the drinker to tell
the truth,” said Hermione.
“Very good, very good!” said Slughorn happily. “Now,” he continued,
pointing at the cauldron nearest the Ravenclaw table, “this one here is pretty
well known. . . . Featured in a few Ministry leaflets lately too . . . Who can —
?”
Hermione’s hand was fastest once more.
“It’s Polyjuice Potion, sir,” she said.
Harry too had recognized the slow-bubbling, mudlike substance in the
second cauldron, b .”
“But that’s impossible,” Harry said as Ron laughed.
“No, it’s not,” said Hermione. “All we’d need would be some Polyjuice
Potion.”
“What’s that?” said Ron and Harry together.
“Snape mentioned it in class a few weeks ago —”
“D’you think we’ve got nothing better to do in Potions than listen to
Snape?” muttered Ron.
“It transforms you into somebody else. Think about it! We could change
into three of the Slytherins. No one would know it was us. Malfoy would
probably tell us anything. He’s probably boasting a see him, but
he seems in no immediate danger.”
Harry did as he was told; Dumbledore covered Moody in the cloak, tucked
it around him, and clambered out of the trunk again. Then he picked up the
hip flask that stood upon the desk, unscrewed it, and turned it over. A thick
glutinous liquid splattered onto the office floor.
“Polyjuice Potion, Harry,” said Dumbledore. “You see the simplicity of it,and the brilliance. For Moody never 
does
 drink except from his hip flask, he’s
well known for it. The imposter ne g up at Hagrid. “The Polyjuice
Potion is designed for human use only.”
“None of the Order would have told Voldemort we were moving tonight,”
said Harry. The idea was dreadful to him, he could not believe it of any of
them. “Voldemort only caught up with me toward the end, he didn’t knowwhich one I was in the beginning. If he’d been in on the plan he’d have
known from the start I was the one with Hagrid.”
“Voldemort caught up with you?” said Lupin sharply. “What happened?
How did you escape?”
Harry explained  a witch
sprouting several extra pairs of arms out of her head.
“Here it is,” said Hermione excitedly as she found the page headed 
The
Polyjuice Potion.
 It was decorated with drawings of people halfway through
transforming into other people. Harry sincerely hoped the artist had imagined
the looks of intense pain on their faces.
“This is the most complicated potion I’ve ever seen,” said Hermione as
they scanned the recipe. “Lacewing flies, leeches, fluxweed, and knotgrass,”
she murmured, running her finger or. “We’ll take separate stalls.”
Careful not to spill a drop of his Polyjuice Potion, Harry slipped into the
middle stall.
“Ready?” he called.
“Ready,” came Ron’s and Hermione’s voices.
“One — two — three —”
Pinching his nose, Harry drank the potion down in two large gulps. It tasted
like overcooked cabbage.
Immediately, his insides started writhing as though he’d just swallowed live
snakes — doubled up, he wondered whether he was going to be sick — then a
burning sensation spread rapidly from his stomach "
What is the name of Voldemort's snake?,Nagini,"Chain of thought: The context is describing a scene where Voldemort is interacting with a snake, and the snake is described as Nagini, Voldemort's snake.

Answer: Nagini."," snake emerged to climb slowly up Voldemort’s chair. It rose,
seemingly endlessly, and came to rest across Voldemort’s shoulders: its neck
the thickness of a man’s thigh; its eyes, with their vertical slits for pupils,
unblinking. Voldemort stroked the creature absently with long thin fingers,
still looking at Lucius Malfoy.
“Why do the Malfoys look so unhappy with their lot? Is my return, my riseto power, not the very thing they professed to desire for so many years?”
“Of course, my Lord,” said Lucius Malf serpent, which relinquished its hold
upon Voldemort at once and turned, hissing furiously, to face Dumbledore.
Voldemort vanished. The snake reared from the floor, ready to strike —
There was a burst of flame in midair above Dumbledore just as Voldemort
reappeared, standing on the plinth in the middle of the pool where so recently
the five statues had stood.
“Look out!” 
Harry yelled.
But even as he shouted, one more jet of green light had flown at
Dumbledore from Voldemort’s wand and the snake had struck — promptly. “Please continue.”
“Voldemort got a letter from an owl. He said something like, Wormtail’s
blunder had been repaired. He said someone was dead. Then he said,
Wormtail wouldn’t be fed to the snake — there was a snake beside his chair.
He said — he said he’d be feeding me to it, instead. Then he did the Cruciatus
Curse on Wormtail — and my scar hurt,” Harry said. “It woke me up, it hurt
so badly.”
Dumbledore merely looked at him.
“Er — that’s all,” said Harry.
“I see,” said Dumbledore quietly. “I se  Voldemort, who stood with his head bowed, and
his white hands folded over the Elder Wand in front of him. He might have
been praying, or else counting silently in his mind, and Harry, standing still
on the edge of the scene, thought absurdly of a child counting in a game of
hide-and-seek. Behind his head, still swirling and coiling, the great snake
Nagini floated in her glittering, charmed cage, like a monstrous halo.
When Dolohov and Yaxley rejoined the circle, Voldemort looked up.
“No sign of him, my Lor He’s in the Shrieking Shack. The snake’s with him, it’s got some sort of
magical protection around it. He’s just sent Lucius Malfoy to find Snape.”
“Voldemort’s sitting in the Shrieking Shack?” said Hermione, outraged.
“He’s not — he’s not even 
fighting
?”
“He doesn’t think he needs to fight,” said Harry. “He thinks I’m going to go
to him.”
“But why?”
“He knows I’m after Horcruxes — he’s keeping Nagini close beside him —
obviously I’m going to have to go to him to get near the thing —”
“Right,” said Ron, s vant I needed, and, poor wizard though he is,
Wormtail was able to follow the instructions I gave him, which would return
me to a rudimentary, weak body of my own, a body I would be able to inhabit
while awaiting the essential ingredients for true rebirth . . . a spell or two of
my own invention . . . a little help from my dear Nagini,” Voldemort’s red
eyes fell upon the continually circling snake, “a potion concocted from
unicorn blood, and the snake venom Nagini provided . . . I was soon returnedto an alm id Voldemort. “But I want there to be no
mistake in anybody’s mind. Harry Potter escaped me by a lucky chance. And
I am now going to prove my power by killing him, here and now, in front of
you all, when there is no Dumbledore to help him, and no mother to die for
him. I will give him his chance. He will be allowed to fight, and you will be
left in no doubt which of us is the stronger. Just a little longer, Nagini,” he
whispered, and the snake glided away through the grass to where the Death
Eaters stood wa cius . . .”
The soft voice seemed to hiss on even after the cruel mouth had stopped
moving. One or two of the wizards barely repressed a shudder as the hissing
grew louder; something heavy could be heard sliding across the floor beneath
the table.

seemingly endlessly, and came to rest across Voldemort’s shoulders: its neck

Who is the caretaker of Hogwarts?,Argus Filch,"Chain of thought: I need to find the caretaker of Hogwarts, which is mentioned in the context of the story. The story mentions Hagrid, who is the gamekeeper and Care of Magical Creatures teacher, but it doesn't explicitly state that he is the caretaker.

Answer: Based on the context, I'm going to take a chance and say that Rubeus Hagrid is not the caretaker of Hogwarts. The story doesn't mention him being appointed as the caretaker, and the caretaker is not explicitly mentioned. However, it does mention the appointment of a new headmaster, Severus Snape, which could be related to the caretaker's role.","up to the task of managing the prestigious

What does the Mirror of Erised show?,The deepest desire of one's heart,"Chain of thought: The context suggests that the Mirror of Erised shows a person what they most desire or what makes them happy. Dumbledore's explanation helps to clarify this, stating that the happiest person would see themselves exactly as they are. Harry's experience with the mirror in the past, where he saw his parents, also gives a hint about what the mirror shows.

can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?”
Harry shook his head.
“Let me explain. The happiest man on earth would be able to use the
Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it and see
himself exactly as he is. Does that help?”
Harry thought. Then he said slo e. He remembered seeing his dead parents in
the Mirror of Erised four years ago. He was going to be able to talk to Sirius
again, right now, he knew it —
He looked around to make sure there was nobody else there; the dormitory
was quite empty. He looked back at the mirror, raised it in front of his face
with trembling hands, and said, loudly and clearly, “Sirius.”
His breath misted the surface of the glass. He held the mirror even closer,
excitement flooding through him, but the eyes blinking back at him th nd chairs
were piled against the walls, and there was an upturned wastepaper basket —
but propped against the wall facing him was something that didn’t look as if it
belonged there, something that looked as if someone had just put it there to
keep it out of the way.
It was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold
frame, standing on two clawed feet. There was an inscription carved around
the top: 
Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi.
His panic fading now that there was no sou e other than Albus
Dumbledore. Harry must have walked straight past him, so desperate to get to
the mirror he hadn’t noticed him.“I — I didn’t see you, sir.”
“Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you,” said Dumbledore,
and Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling.
“So,” said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with Harry,
“you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of
Erised.”
“I didn’t know it was called that, sir.”
“But I expect you’ve real n driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible.
“The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow, Harry, and I ask you
not to go looking for it again. If you ever 
do
 run across it, you will now be
prepared. It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, remember that.
Now, why don’t you put that admirable Cloak back on and get off to bed?”Harry stood up.
“Sir — Professor Dumbledore? Can I ask you something?”
“Obviously, you’ve just done so,” Dumbledore smiled. “You may ask me
o  see that he was smiling.
“So,” said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with Harry,
“you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of
Erised.”
“I didn’t know it was called that, sir.”
“But I expect you’ve realized by now what it does?”
“It — well — it shows me my family —”
“And it showed your friend Ron himself as Head Boy.”
“How did you know — ?”
“I don’t need a cloak to become invisible,” said Dumbledore gently. “Now,
can you think what the Mirror of Erised s I’ll see where it’s hidden! But
how can I look without Quirrell realizing what I’m up to?
He tried to edge to the left, to get in front of the glass without Quirrell
noticing, but the ropes around his ankles were too tight: he tripped and fell
over. Quirrell ignored him. He was still talking to himself.
“What does this mirror do? How does it work? Help me, Master!”
And to Harry’s horror, a voice answered, and the voice seemed to come
from Quirrell himself.
“Use the boy . . . Use the boy . . .”
Quirrell roun they’re really rare, and 
really
 valuable.”
“What is it?”
Harry picked the shining, silvery cloth off the floor. It was strange to the
touch, like water woven into material.
“It’s an Invisibility Cloak,” said Ron, a look of awe on his face. “I’m sure it
is — try it on.”
Harry threw the Cloak around his shoulders and Ron gave a yell.
“It 
is
! Look down!”
Harry looked down at his feet, but they were gone. He dashed to the mirror.
Sure enough, his reflection looked back at him, just his head suspended in

Harry’s elbow very hard.
“There’s something moving over there,” Harry breathed. “Listen . . .
sounds like something big. . . .”
They listened. Some distance to their right, the something big was snapping
branches as it carved a path through the trees.
“Oh, no,” said Ron. “Oh, no, oh, no, oh —”
“Shut up,” said Harry frantically. “It’ll hear you.”
“Hear 
me
?” said Ron in an unnaturally high voice. “It’s already heard
Fang!”
The darkness seemed to be pressing on  mbs-up. Right — earmuffs 
on

Harry snapped the earmuffs over his ears. They shut out sound completely.
Professor Sprout put the pink, fluffy pair over her own ears, rolled up thesleeves of her robes, grasped one of the tufty plants firmly, and pulled hard.
Harry let out a gasp of surprise that no one could hear.
Instead of roots, a small, muddy, and extremely ugly baby popped out of
the earth. The leaves were growing right out of his head. He had pale green,
mottled skin, and was clearly bawling at the t hes as it carved a path through the trees.
“Oh, no,” said Ron. “Oh, no, oh, no, oh —”
“Shut up,” said Harry frantically. “It’ll hear you.”
“Hear 
me
?” said Ron in an unnaturally high voice. “It’s already heard
Fang!”
The darkness seemed to be pressing on their eyeballs as they stood,
terrified, waiting. There was a strange rumbling noise and then silence.
“What d’you think it’s doing?” said Harry.
“Probably getting ready to pounce,” said Ron.
They waited, shivering, hardly daring to move.
“D’you think it’s oice was cracked with lack of use. “Come back!”
She continued to step deliberately through the trees, and soon her
brightness was striped by their thick black trunks. For one trembling secondhe hesitated. Caution murmured it could be a trick, a lure, a trap. But instinct,
overwhelming instinct, told him that this was not Dark Magic. He set off in
pursuit.
Snow crunched beneath his feet, but the doe made no noise as she passed
through the trees, for she was nothing but light. Deeper and deeper into the
fores  that it caught at her mousy hair in
passing. She let out an earsplitting scream and threw her hands over her head
while some of the centaurs bellowed their approval and others laughed
raucously. The sound of their wild, neighing laughter echoing around the
dimly lit clearing and the sight of their pawing hooves was extremely
unnerving.“Whose forest is it now, human?” bellowed Bane.
“Filthy half-breeds!” she screamed, her hands still tight over her head.
“Beasts! Uncontrolled animals!”
“Be quiet!” shouted H  shouted Hagrid, looking up apprehensively in case of
further falling eggs, “I’ve brought some friends ter meet yeh. Remember, I
told yeh I might? Remember, when I said I might have ter go on a little trip
an’ leave them ter look after yeh fer a bit? Remember that, Grawpy?”
But Grawp merely gave another low roar; it was hard to say whether he
was listening to Hagrid or whether he even recognized the sounds Hagrid was
making as speech. He had now seized the top of the pine tree and was pulling
it toward him, sted rather
than revolted, but putting down his rock cake all the same.
“Jus’ giant grubs,” said Hagrid.
“And they grow into . . . ?” said Ron, looking apprehensive.“They won’ grow inter nuthin’,” said Hagrid. “I got ’em ter feed ter
Aragog.”
And without warning, he burst into tears.
“Hagrid!” cried Hermione, leaping up, hurrying around the table the long
way to avoid the barrel of maggots, and putting an arm around his shaking
shoulders. “What is it?”
“It’s . . . him . . .” gulped Hagrid, his beetle-black  though
expecting to be set upon at any moment.
“Gather roun’, gather roun’,” said Hagrid encouragingly. “Now, they’ll be
attracted by the smell o’ the meat but I’m goin’ ter give ’em a call anyway,
’cause they’ll like ter know it’s me . . .”
He turned, shook his shaggy head to get the hair out of his face, and gave
an odd, shrieking cry that echoed through the dark trees like the call of some
monstrous bird. Nobody laughed; most of them looked too scared to make a
sound.
Hagrid gave the shrieking cry again."

“There are no Wizarding princes,” said Lupin, now smiling. “Is this a title
you’re thinking of adopting? I should have thought being ‘the Chosen One’
would be enough.”
“It’s nothing to do with me!” said Harry indignantly. “The Half-Blood
Prince is someone who used to go to Hogwarts, I’ve got his old Potions book.
He wrote spells all over it, spells he invented. One of them was Levicorpus
—”
“Oh, that one had a great vogue during my time at Hogwarts,” said Lupin
reminiscently. “There were a few months in m ed to have developed a close
friendship with the boy who brought around You-Know-Who’s fall
from power — thereby driving Hagrid’s own mother, like the rest of
You-Know-Who’s supporters, into hiding. Perhaps Harry Potter is
unaware of the unpleasant truth about his large friend — but Albus
Dumbledore surely has a duty to ensure that Harry Potter, along
with his fellow students, is warned about the dangers of associating
with part-giants.
Harry finished reading and looked up at Ron, whose mouth was hanging

discuss their argument. They were being quite friendly to each other, though
oddly formal. Ron and Harry wasted no time in telling Hermione about the
conversation they had overheard between Madame Maxime and Hagrid, but
Hermione didn’t seem to find the news that Hagrid was a half-giant nearly as
shocking as Ron did.
“Well, I thought he must be,” she said, shrugging. “I knew he couldn’t be
pure giant because they’re about twenty feet tall. But honestly, all this

Dumbledore surely has a duty to ensure that Harry Potter, along
with his fellow students, is warned about the dangers of associating

Harry finished reading and looked up at Ron, whose mouth was hanging

“How did she find out?” he whispered.
But that wasn’t what was bothering Harry.
“What d’you mean, ‘we all hate Hagrid’?” Harry spat at Malfoy. “What’s

“Eh?” said Hagrid blankly. “No, don’ go! I’ve — I’ve never met another

“Anuzzer 
what,
 precisely?” said Madame Maxime, her tone icy.
Harry could have told Hagrid it was best not to answer; he stood there in
the shadows gritting his teeth, hoping against hope he wouldn’t — but it was
no good.
“Another half-giant, o’ course!” said Hagrid.
“’Ow dare you!” shrieked Madame Maxime. Her voice exploded through
the peaceful night air like a foghorn; behind him, Harry heard Fleur and

Dumbledore’s office, so I daresay it picks things up there.”
“And it wants all the Houses to be friends?” said Harry, looking over at the
Slytherin table, where Draco Malfoy was holding court. “Fat chance.”
“Well, now, you shouldn’t take that attitude,” said Nick reprovingly.
“Peaceful cooperation, that’s the key. We ghosts, though we belong to
separate Houses, maintain links of friendship. In spite of the competitiveness
between Gryffindor ugh Riddle was a friend he’d had when he was very small, and had half-
forgotten. But this was absurd. He’d never had friends before Hogwarts,
Dudley had made sure of that.
Nevertheless, Harry was determined to find out more about Riddle, so next
day at break, he headed for the trophy room to examine Riddle’s special
award, accompanied by an interested Hermione and a thoroughly
unconvinced Ron, who told them he’d seen enough of the trophy room to last
him a lifetime.

“Well, why not? Harry, there aren’t any real princes in the Wizarding
world! It’s either a nickname, a made-up title somebody’s given themselves,
or it could be their actual name, couldn’t it? No, listen! If, say, her father wasa wizard whose surname was Prince, and her mother was a Muggle, then that
would make her a ‘half-blood Prince’!”
“Yeah, very ingenious, Hermione . . .”
“But it would! Maybe she was proud of being half a Prince!”

What does a Patronus do?,Repels Dementors,"Question: What does a Patronus do?
Chain of thought: According to the context, a Patronus is a kind of positive force that is a projection of the wizard's hope, happiness, and desire to survive. It's mentioned that the Patronus cannot feel despair, which makes it difficult for dementors to hurt it. This implies that the Patronus is a protective charm that wards off dementors.

Answer: A Patronus is a protective charm that repels dementors, using the wizard's happy memories to create a positive force that cannot be affected by despair.","pin continued, “The Patronus is a
kind of positive force, a projection of the very things that the dementor feeds
upon — hope, happiness, the desire to survive — but it cannot feel despair, as
real humans can, so the dementors can’t hurt it. But I must warn you, Harry,

dementor.
“Oh, don’t be such a killjoy,” said Cho brightly, watching her silvery swan-
shaped Patronus soar around the Room of Requirement during their last
lesson before Easter. “They’re so pretty!”
“They’re not supposed to be pretty, they’re supposed to protect you,” said
Harry patiently. “What we really need is a boggart or something; that’s how I
learned, I had to conjure a Patronus while the boggart was pretending to be a
dementor —”
“But that would be really scary!” said Lavender, w a cupboard under my desk he’ll like.”
“Okay,” said Harry, trying to sound as though he wasn’t apprehensive at all
and merely glad that Lupin had found such a good substitute for a real
dementor.
“So . . .” Professor Lupin had taken out his own wand, and indicated that
Harry should do the same. “The spell I am going to try and teach you is
highly advanced magic, Harry — well beyond Ordinary Wizarding Level. It
is called the Patronus Charm.”

“which is a kind of anti-dementor — a guardian that acts as a shield between
you and the dementor.”
Harry had a sudden vision of himself crouching behind a Hagrid-sized
figure holding a large club. Professor Lu Your Patronus had a clearly defined form? I mean to say, it was more than
vapor or smoke?”
“Yes,” said Harry, feeling both impatient and slightly desperate, “it’s a stag,
it’s always a stag.”
“Always?” boomed Madam Bones. “You have produced a Patronus before
now?”
“Yes,”
 said Harry, “I’ve been doing it for over a year —”
“And you are fifteen years old?”
“Yes, and —”
“You learned this at school?”
“Yes, Professor Lupin taught me in my third year, because of the —”
“Impressive,” said Madam Bones, staring down er animal. He screwed up his eyes, trying to see what it
was. It looked like a horse. It was galloping silently away from him, across
the black surface of the lake. He saw it lower its head and charge at the
swarming dementors. . . . Now it was galloping around and around the black
shapes on the ground, and the dementors were falling back, scattering,
retreating into the darkness. . . . They were gone.

Who is the head of Hufflepuff House?,Pomona Sprout,"Chain of thought: The passage mentions Professor McGonagall as the deputy headmistress and Head of Gryffindor House, and also mentions Snape as the Head of Slytherin House. It does not mention the Head of Hufflepuff House.

one another in their efforts to get out of the line of fire. Harry looked up and
saw, floating twenty feet above them, Peeves the Poltergeist, a little man in a
bell-covered hat and orange bow tie, his wide, malicious face contorted withconcentration as he took aim again.
“PEEVES!” yelled an angry voice. “Peeves, come down here at ONCE!”

“What have we got today?” Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar on his
porridge.
“Double Potions with the Slytherins,” said Ron. “Snape’s Head of Slytherin

“Wish McGonagall favored us,” said Harry. Professor McGonagall was

“Malfoy,” replied Harry at once, his worst fear confirmed.

taking another.
“And that complete

“And Anthony Goldstein and Padma Patil for Ravenclaw,” said Hermione.
“You went to the Yule Ball with Padma Patil,”   now hanging on Professor Binns’s every word. He

“This is Amos Diggory, everyone,” said Mr. Weasley. “He works for the
Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures. And I think
you know his son, Cedric?”
Cedric Diggory was an extremely handsome boy of around seventeen. He
was Captain and Seeker of the Hufflepuff House Quidditch team at Hogwarts.
“Hi,” said Cedric, looking around at them all.
Everybody said hi back except Fred and George, who merely nodded. They
had never quite forgiven Cedric for beating their team, Gryffindor,  you are here, your House will be something like
your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your
House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free time in your House
common room.

Slytherin. Each House has its own noble history and each has produced

What creature is Buckbeak?,Hippogriff,"Chain of thought: I've read the context and seen that Buckbeak is described as a ""great gray hippogriff"" and is shown to be eating dead ferrets. This information suggests that Buckbeak is a type of creature that is a mix of a horse and an eagle.

Answer: Buckbeak is a hippogriff.","n, and Hermione looked at one another. They had never seen eye
to eye with Hagrid about what he called “interesting creatures” and other
people called “terrifying monsters.” On the other hand, there didn’t seem to
be any particular harm in Buckbeak. In fact, by Hagrid’s usual standards, he
was positively cute.
“You’ll have to put up a good strong defense, Hagrid,” said Hermione,
sitting down and laying a hand on Hagrid’s massive forearm. “I’m sure you
can prove Buckbeak is safe.”
“Won’t make no diff’rence!” y, Ron, and
Hermione whip around. Buckbeak the hippogriff was lying in the corner,
chomping on something that was oozing blood all over the floor.
“I couldn’ leave him tied up out there in the snow!” choked Hagrid. “All on
his own! At Christmas.”
Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another. They had never seen eye
to eye with Hagrid about what he called “interesting creatures” and other
people called “terrifying monsters.” On the other hand, there didn’t seem to
be any particular harm in Buckbeak. In fac  in loving detail.
The great gray hippogriff, Buckbeak, was tethered in front of Hagrid’s
cabin. He clicked his razor-sharp beak at their approach and turned his huge
head toward them.
“Oh dear,” said Hermione nervously. “He’s still a bit scary, isn’t he?”
“Come off it, you’ve ridden him, haven’t you?” said Ron.
Harry stepped forward and bowed low to the hippogriff without breaking
eye contact or blinking. After a few seconds, Buckbeak sank into a bow too.
“How are you?” Harry asked him in a low voice, movi eard all abou’ it,” said Hagrid, opening the front doors and
leading them outside.
“Oh,” said Ron, looking slightly put out.
The first thing they saw on entering Hagrid’s cabin was Buckbeak, who
was stretched out on top of Hagrid’s patchwork quilt, his enormous wings
folded tight to his body, enjoying a large plate of dead ferrets. Averting his
eyes from this unpleasant sight, Harry saw a gigantic, hairy brown suit and a
very horrible yellow-and-orange tie hanging from the top of Hagrid’s
wardrobe door.
“Wh ne! Gone! Bless his little beak, he’s 
gone
! Musta pulled himself free!
Beaky, yeh clever boy!”
Buckbeak started to strain against the rope, trying to get back to Hagrid.
Harry and Hermione tightened their grip and dug their heels into the forest
floor to stop him.
“Someone untied him!” the executioner was snarling. “We should search
the grounds, the forest —”

will have led him away on foot?” said Dumbledore, still sounding amused.  show him something other than swirling white fog, but nothing

“Well?” Professor Trelawney prompted delicately. “What do you see?”
The heat was overpowering and his nostrils were stinging with the
perfumed smoke wafting from the fire beside them. He thought of what Ron
had just said, and decided to pretend.
“Er —” said Harry, “a dark shape . . . um . . .”
“What does it resemble?” whispered Professor Trelawney. “Think,
now . . .”
Harry cast his mind around and it landed on Buckbeak.
“A hippogriff,” 
“Come off it, you’ve ridden him, haven’t you?” said Ron.
Harry stepped forward and bowed low to the hippogriff without breaking
eye contact or blinking. After a few seconds, Buckbeak sank into a bow too.
“How are you?” Harry asked him in a low voice, moving forward to stroke
the feathery head. “Missing him? But you’re okay here with Hagrid, aren’t
you?”
“Oi!” said a loud voice.Hagrid had come striding around the corner of his cabin wearing a large

Who is the founder of Gryffindor House?,Godric Gryffindor,"Question: Who is the founder of Gryffindor House?
Chain of thought: The text mentions that Hogwarts was founded by four greatest witches and wizards of the age, and the four school Houses are named after them: Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin. The text also mentions that Godric Gryffindor was the founder of Harry's House, which is Gryffindor House.

ago — the precise date is uncertain — by the four greatest witches and
wizards of the age. The four school Houses are named after them: Godric
Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin.
They built this castle together, far from prying Muggle eyes, for it was an age
when magic was feared by common people, and witches and wizards suffered
much persecution.”
He paused, gazed blearily around the room, and c e
rubies set into the hilt, which Harry recognized as the one he himself had
pulled out of the Sorting Hat in his second year. The sword had once belonged
to Godric Gryffindor, founder of Harry’s House. He was gazing at it,
remembering how it had come to his aid when he had thought all hope was
lost, when he noticed a patch of silvery light, dancing and shimmering on the
glass case. He looked around for the source of the light and saw a sliver of
silver-white shining brightly from within a black cabinet beh  now hanging on Professor Binns’s every word. He

find their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast without getting lost once.
“What have we got today?” Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar on his
porridge.
“Double Potions with the Slytherins,” said Ron. “Snape’s Head of Slytherin
House. They say he always favors them — we’ll be able to see if it’s true.”
“Wish McGonagall favored us,” said Harry. Professor McGonagall was
head of Gryffindor House, but it hadn’t stopped her from giving them a huge
pile of homework the day bef ng plan
To educate young sorcerers
Thus Hogwarts School began.Now each of these four founders
Formed their own House, for each
Did value different virtues
In the ones they had to teach.
By Gryffindor, the bravest were
Prized far beyond the rest;
For Ravenclaw, the cleverest
Would always be the best;
For Hufflepuff, hard workers were
Most worthy of admission;
And power-hungry Slytherin
Loved those of great ambition.
While still alive they did divide
Their favorites from the throng,
Yet how to pick the worthy , “We’ll teach all those
With brave deeds to their name.”
Said Hufflepuff, “I’ll teach the lot,
And treat them just the same.”These differences caused little strife
When first they came to light,
For each of the four founders had
A House in which they might
Take only those they wanted, so,
For instance, Slytherin
Took only pure-blood wizards
Of great cunning, just like him,
And only those of sharpest mind
Were taught by Ravenclaw
While the bravest and the boldest
Went to daring Gryffindor.
Good Hufflepuff,   you are here, your House will be something like
your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your
House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free time in your House

one another in their efforts to get out of the line of fire. Harry looked up and
saw, floating twenty feet above them, Peeves the Poltergeist, a little man in a
bell-covered hat and orange bow tie, his wide, malicious face contorted withconcentration as he took aim again.
“PEEVES!” yelled an angry voice. “Peeves, come down here at ONCE!”

Dear Mr. Potter,

“Oh . . .” The girl who had spoken turned her back on him, and as they
walked on they distinctly heard her say, “’Ogwarts.”
“Beauxbatons,” muttered Hermione.
“Sorry?” said Harry.
“They must go to Beauxbatons,” said Hermione. “You know . . .
Beauxbatons Academy of Magic . . . I read about it in

Magical Education in Europe.

“Oh . . . yeah . . . right,” said Harry.
“Fred and George can’t have gone that far,” said Ron, pulling out his wand,
lighting it like Hermione’s, and squinting  Head Boy, winner of the Award for Special Services to the School. I
know that several teachers, Professor Slughorn amongst them, suggested that
he join the Ministry of Magic, offered to set up appointments, put him in
touch with useful contacts. He refused all offers. The next thing the staff
knew, Voldemort was working at Borgin and Burkes.”
“At Borgin and Burkes?” Harry repeated, stunned.
“At Borgin and Burkes,” repeated Dumbledore calmly. “I think you will

rapped on the door. It opened silently and they entered. Professor
McGonagall told Harry to wait and left him there, alone.
Harry looked around. One thing was certain: of all the teachers’ offices
Harry had visited so far this year, Dumbledore’s was by far the most
interesting. If he hadn’t been scared out of his wits that he was about to be
thrown out of school, he would have been very pleased to have a chance to
look around it.
It was a large and beautiful circular room, full of   of his face.
“Well, Potter, you know why you are here,” he said. “The headmaster has
asked me to teach you Occlumency. I can only hope that you prove more
adept at it than Potions.”
“Right,” said Harry tersely.
“This may not be an ordinary class, Potter,” said Snape, his eyes narrowed
malevolently, “but I am still your teacher and you will therefore call me ‘sir’
or ‘Professor’ at all times.”
