Who is Harry Potter's best friend?,Ron Weasley,"According to the context, Harry Potter's best friend is Hermione Granger.","
sniggered, but Slughorn showed no dismay; on the contrary, he beamed and
looked from Hermione to Harry, who was sitting next to her.
“Oho! 
‘One of my best friends is Muggle-born, and she’s the best in our
year!’
 I’m assuming this is the very friend of whom you spoke, Harry?”
“Yes, sir,” said Harry.
“Well, well, take twenty well-earned points for Gryffindor, Miss Granger,”
said Slughorn genially.
Malfoy looked rather as he had done the time Hermione had punched him
in the face. Hermione turned to Harry with a radiant expression and
whispered, “Did you really tell him I’m the best in the year? Oh, Harry!”
“Well, what’s so impressive about that?” whispered Ron, who for somereason looked annoyed. “You 
are
 the best in the year — I’d’ve told him so if
he’d asked me!”
Hermione smiled but made a “shhing” gesture, so that they could hear what
Slughorn was saying. Ron looked slightly disgruntled.
“Amortentia doesn’t really create 
love,
 of course. It is impossible to
manufacture or imitate love. No, this will sim say you remember him at Hogwarts, Rosmerta,” murmured Professor
McGonagall. “Do you remember who his best friend was?”
“Naturally,” said Madam Rosmerta, with a small laugh. “Never saw one
without the other, did you? The number of times I had them in here — ooh,
they used to make me laugh. Quite the double act, Sirius Black and James
Potter!”
Harry dropped his tankard with a loud clunk. Ron kicked him.
“Precisely,” said Professor McGonagall. “Black and Potter. Ringleaders of
their little gang. Both very bright, of course — exceptionally bright, in fact —
but I don’t think we’ve ever had such a pair of troublemakers —”
“I dunno,” chuckled Hagrid. “Fred and George Weasley could give ’em a
run fer their money.”
“You’d have thought Black and Potter were brothers!” chimed in Professor
Flitwick. “Inseparable!”
“Of course they were,” said Fudge. “Potter trusted Black beyond all his
other friends. Nothing changed when they left school. Black was best man
when James married Lily. Then they named him godfather to Harry. . Again, your readers will have to buy my book for the
whole story, but there is no question that Dumbledore took an unnatural
interest in Potter from the word go. Whether that was really in the boy’s
best interests — well, we’ll see. It’s certainly an open secret that Potter
has had a most troubled adolescence.”
I ask whether Skeeter is still in touch with Harry Potter, whom she so
famously interviewed last year: a breakthrough piece in which Potter
spoke exclusively of his conviction that You-Know-Who had returned.
“Oh, yes, we’ve developed a close bond,” says Skeeter. “Poor Potter
has few real friends, and we met at one of the most testing moments of
his life — the Triwizard Tournament. I am probably one of the only
people alive who can say that they know the real Harry Potter.”
Which leads us neatly to the many rumors still circulating about
Dumbledore’s final hours. Does Skeeter believe that Potter was there
when Dumbledore died?
“Well, I don’t want to say too much — it’s all in the book — but
eyewitness tion of the mouthpiece. “WHO
ARE YOU?”
“RON — WEASLEY!” Ron bellowed back, as though he and Uncle
Vernon were speaking from opposite ends of a football field. “I’M — A —
FRIEND — OF — HARRY’S — FROM — SCHOOL —”
Uncle Vernon’s small eyes swiveled around to Harry, who was rooted to the
spot.
“THERE IS NO HARRY POTTER HERE!” he roared, now holding the
receiver at arm’s length, as though frightened it might explode. “I DON’T
KNOW WHAT SCHOOL YOU’RE TALKING ABOUT! NEVER
CONTACT ME AGAIN! DON’T YOU COME NEAR MY FAMILY!”
And he threw the receiver back onto the telephone as if dropping a
poisonous spider.The fight that had followed had been one of the worst ever.
“HOW DARE YOU GIVE THIS NUMBER TO PEOPLE LIKE —
PEOPLE LIKE 
YOU
!”
 
Uncle Vernon had roared, spraying Harry with spit.
Ron obviously realized that he’d gotten Harry into trouble, because he
hadn’t called again. Harry’s other best friend from Hogwarts, Hermione
Granger, hadn’t been in touch either. Harry suspected that Ron had warned
Hermione not to call, w e three Weasley boys, Harry, Hermione, and Ginny.
“All these yours, Arthur?”
“Oh no, only the redheads,” said Mr. Weasley, pointing out his children.
“This is Hermione, friend of Ron’s — and Harry, another friend —”
“Merlin’s beard,” said Amos Diggory, his eyes widening. “Harry? Harry
Potter
?”
“Er — yeah,” said Harry.
Harry was used to people looking curiously at him when they met him,
used to the way their eyes moved at once to the lightning scar on his forehead,
but it always made him feel uncomfortable.
“Ced’s talked about you, of course,” said Amos Diggory. “Told us all about
playing against you last year. . . . I said to him, I said — Ced, that’ll be
something to tell your grandchildren, that will. . . . 
You beat Harry Potter
!”
Harry couldn’t think of any reply to this, so he remained silent. Fred and
George were both scowling again. Cedric looked slightly embarrassed.
“Harry fell off his broom, Dad,” he muttered. “I told you . . . it was an
accident. . . .”
“Yes, but 
you
 didn’t fall off, did you?”  “Ah, speak not the
name, sir! Speak not the name!”
“Sorry,” said Harry quickly. “I know lots of people don’t like it. My friend
Ron —”
He stopped again. Thinking about Ron was painful, too.
Dobby leaned toward Harry, his eyes wide as headlights.
“Dobby heard tell,” he said hoarsely, “that Harry Potter met the Dark Lord
for a second time, just weeks ago . . . that Harry Potter escaped 
yet again.
”
Harry nodded and Dobby’s eyes suddenly shone with tears.
“Ah, sir,” he gasped, dabbing his face with a corner of the grubby
pillowcase he was wearing. “Harry Potter is valiant and bold! He has braved
so many dangers already! But Dobby has come to protect Harry Potter, to
warn him, even if he 
does
 have to shut his ears in the oven door later. . . .
Harry Potter must not go back to Hogwarts.
”
There was a silence broken only by the chink of knives and forks from
downstairs and the distant rumble of Uncle Vernon’s voice.
“W-what?” Harry stammered. “But I’ve got to go back — term starts on
September first. It’s all th  never knew. . . .”
Harry, who was feeling distinctly hot in the face, said, “Whatever you’ve
heard about my greatness is a load of rubbish. I’m not even top of my year atHogwarts; that’s Hermione, she —”
But he stopped quickly, because thinking about Hermione was painful.
“Harry Potter is humble and modest,” said Dobby reverently, his orb-like
eyes aglow. “Harry Potter speaks not of his triumph over He-Who-Must-Not-
Be-Named —”
“Voldemort?” said Harry.
Dobby clapped his hands over his bat ears and moaned, “Ah, speak not the
name, sir! Speak not the name!”
“Sorry,” said Harry quickly. “I know lots of people don’t like it. My friend
Ron —”
He stopped again. Thinking about Ron was painful, too.

CHAPTER  ONE
THE BOY WHO LIVED
r. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say
that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much"
What house is Harry Potter sorted into?,Gryffindor,"According to the text, Harry Potter is sorted into Gryffindor House.","rom a doorway to the right — the
rest of the school must already be here — but Professor McGonagall showed
the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in,
standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering
about nervously.
“Welcome to Hogwarts,” said Professor McGonagall. “The start-of-term
banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall,
you will be sorted into your Houses. The Sorting is a very importantceremony because, while you are here, your House will be something like
your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your
House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free time in your House
common room.
“The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and
Slytherin. Each House has its own noble history and each has produced
outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs
will earn your House points, while any rule-breaking will lose House points.
At the end of the  you are here, your House will be something like
your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your
House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free time in your House
common room.
“The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and
Slytherin. Each House has its own noble history and each has produced
outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs
will earn your House points, while any rule-breaking will lose House points.
At the end of the year, the House with the most points is awarded the House
Cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever House
becomes yours.
“The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest
of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can
while you are waiting.”
Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville’s cloak, which was fastened
under his left ear, and on Ron’s smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to
flatten his hair.
“I shall return when we are r  sir!” she said in a muffled squeak. “No, no, no. I
says to Dobby, I says, go find yourself a nice family and settle down, Dobby.
He is getting up to all sorts of high jinks, sir, what is unbecoming to a house-
elf. You goes racketing around like this, Dobby, I says, and next thing I hear
you’s up in front of the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical
Creatures, like some common goblin.”“Well, it’s about time he had a bit of fun,” said Harry.
“House-elves is not supposed to have fun, Harry Potter,” said Winky
firmly, from behind her hands. “House-elves does what they is told. I is not
liking heights at all, Harry Potter” — she glanced toward the edge of the box
and gulped — “but my master sends me to the Top Box and I comes, sir.”
“Why’s he sent you up here, if he knows you don’t like heights?” said
Harry, frowning.
“Master — master wants me to save him a seat, Harry Potter. He is very
busy,” said Winky, tilting her head toward the empty space beside her.
“Winky is wishing she is back in master’ ter,” said Winky
firmly, from behind her hands. “House-elves does what they is told. I is not
liking heights at all, Harry Potter” — she glanced toward the edge of the box
and gulped — “but my master sends me to the Top Box and I comes, sir.”
“Why’s he sent you up here, if he knows you don’t like heights?” said
Harry, frowning.
“Master — master wants me to save him a seat, Harry Potter. He is very
busy,” said Winky, tilting her head toward the empty space beside her.
“Winky is wishing she is back in master’s tent, Harry Potter, but Winky does
what she is told. Winky is a good house-elf.”
She gave the edge of the box another frightened look and hid her eyes
completely again. Harry turned back to the others.
“So that’s a house-elf?” Ron muttered. “Weird things, aren’t they?”
“Dobby was weirder,” said Harry fervently.
Ron pulled out his Omnioculars and started testing them, staring down into
the crowd on the other side of the stadium.
“Wild!” he said, twiddling the replay knob on the side. “I can make that old
b e or two
little matters with you, Peter, if you’d be so —”
“He’s come to try and kill me again!” Pettigrew squeaked suddenly,
pointing at Black, and Harry saw that he used his middle finger, because his
index was missing. “He killed Lily and James and now he’s going to kill me
too. . . . You’ve got to help me, Remus. . . .”
Black’s face looked more skull-like than ever as he stared at Pettigrew with
his fathomless eyes.
“No one’s going to try and kill you until we’ve sorted a few things out,”
said Lupin.
“Sorted things out?” squealed Pettigrew, looking wildly about him once
more, eyes taking in the boarded windows and, again, the only door. “I knew
he’d come after me! I knew he’d be back for me! I’ve been waiting for this
for twelve years!”
“You knew Sirius was going to break out of Azkaban?” said Lupin, his
brow furrowed. “When nobody has ever done it before?”
“He’s got Dark powers the rest of us can only dream of!” Pettigrew shouted
shrilly. “How else did he get out of there? I suppose He-Who-Must-Not-Be-

pillowcase he was wearing. “Harry Potter is valiant and bold! He has braved
so many dangers already! But Dobby has come to protect Harry Potter, to
warn him, even if he 
does

”
There was a silence broken only by the chink of knives and forks from
downstairs and the distant rumble of Uncle Vernon’s voice.
“W-what?” Harry stammered. “But I’ve got to go back — term starts on
September first. It’s all that’s keeping me going. You don’t know what it’s like
here. I don’t 
belong
 here. I belong in your world — at Hogwarts.”
“No, no, no,” squeaked Dobby, shaking his head so hard his ears flapped.
“Harry Potter must stay where he is safe. He is too great, too good, to lose. If
Harry Potter goes back to Hogwarts, he will be in mortal danger.”
“Why?” said Harry in surprise.“There is a plot, Harry Potter. A plot to make most terrible things happen at
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year,” whispere ting from the egg in Filch’s arms to the
map in Moody’s hand, and Harry could tell he was putting two and two
together, as only Snape could. . . .
“Potter,” he said quietly.
“What’s that?” said Moody calmly, folding up the map and pocketing it.
“Potter!” Snape snarled, and he actually turned his head and stared right at
the place where Harry was, as though he could suddenly see him. “That egg is
Potter’s egg. That piece of parchment belongs to Potter. I have seen it before,
I recognize it! Potter is here! Potter, in his Invisibility Cloak!”
Snape stretched out his hands like a blind man and began to move up the
stairs; Harry could have sworn his over-large nostrils were dilating, trying to
sniff Harry out — trapped, Harry leaned backward, trying to avoid Snape’s
fingertips, but any moment now —
“There’s nothing there, Snape!” barked Moody, “but I’ll be happy to tell
the headmaster how quickly your mind jumped to Harry Potter!”
“Meaning what?” Snape turned again to look at Moody, his hands still
outstretched,  ,” Vernon Dursley said now, resuming his pacing up and
down the living room, “we — Petunia, Dudley, and I — are in danger. From
— from —”
“Some of ‘my lot,’ right,” said Harry.
“Well, I don’t believe it,” repeated Uncle Vernon, coming to a halt in front
of Harry again. “I was awake half the night thinking it all over, and I believe
it’s a plot to get the house.”
“The house?” repeated Harry. “What house?”
“
This 
house!” shrieked Uncle Vernon, the vein in his forehead starting to
pulse. “
Our
 house! House prices are skyrocketing around here! You want us
out of the way and then you’re going to do a bit of hocus-pocus and before weknow it the deeds will be in your name and —”
“Are you out of your mind?” demanded Harry. “A plot to get this house?
Are you actually as stupid as you look?”
“Don’t you dare — !” squealed Aunt Petunia, but again, Vernon waved her
down: Slights on his personal appearance were, it seemed, as nothing to the
danger he had spotted.
“Just in case you’ve forgotten,” said Harry, “I’ve already"
What is the name of Harry Potter's owl?,Hedwig,The name of Harry Potter's owl is Hedwig.,"r at Hogwarts more enjoyable.
If ever you need me, send word. Your owl will find me.
I’ll write again soon.
Sirius
Harry looked eagerly inside the envelope. There was another piece of
parchment in there. He read it through quickly and felt suddenly as warm and
contented as though he’d swallowed a bottle of hot butterbeer in one gulp.
I, Sirius Black, Harry Potter’s godfather, hereby give him permission to
visit Hogsmeade on weekends.
“That’ll be good enough for Dumbledore!” said Harry happily. He looked
back at Sirius’s letter.
“Hang on, there’s a P.S. . . .”
I thought your friend Ron might like to keep this owl, as it’s my fault
he no longer has a rat.
Ron’s eyes widened. The minute owl was still hooting excitedly.
“Keep him?” he said uncertainly. He looked closely at the owl for a
moment; then, to Harry’s and Hermione’s great surprise, he held him out for
Crookshanks to sniff.
“What d’you reckon?” Ron asked the cat. “Definitely an owl?”Crookshanks purred.
“That’s good enough for me,” said Ron happily. “He’s He
brought it carefully inside. The owl dropped its letter onto Harry’s seat and
began zooming around their compartment, apparently very pleased with itself
for accomplishing its task. Hedwig clicked her beak with a sort of dignified
disapproval. Crookshanks sat up in his seat, following the owl with his great
yellow eyes. Ron, noticing this, snatched the owl safely out of harm’s way.
Harry picked up the letter. It was addressed to him. He ripped open the
letter, and shouted, “It’s from Sirius!”
“What?” said Ron and Hermione excitedly. “Read it aloud!”
Dear Harry,
I hope this finds you before you reach your aunt and uncle. I don’t
know whether they’re used to owl post.
Buckbeak and I are in hiding. I won’t tell you where, in case this falls
into the wrong hands. I have some doubt about the owl’s reliability, but
he is the best I could find, and he did seem eager for the job.
I believe the dementors are still searching for me, but they haven’t a
hope of finding me here. I am planning to allow some Muggles to
g er his shoulder. “What’s thatthing outside your window?”
Harry turned to look outside. Something very small and gray was bobbing
in and out of sight beyond the glass. He stood up for a better look and saw
that it was a tiny owl, carrying a letter that was much too big for it. The owl
was so small, in fact, that it kept tumbling over in the air, buffeted this way
and that in the train’s slipstream. Harry quickly pulled down the window,
stretched out his arm, and caught it. It felt like a very fluffy Snitch. He
brought it carefully inside. The owl dropped its letter onto Harry’s seat and
began zooming around their compartment, apparently very pleased with itself
for accomplishing its task. Hedwig clicked her beak with a sort of dignified
disapproval. Crookshanks sat up in his seat, following the owl with his great
yellow eyes. Ron, noticing this, snatched the owl safely out of harm’s way.

I believe the dementors are still searching for me, but they haven’t a

glimpse me soon, a long way from Hogwarts, so that the security on the
castle will be lifted.
There is something I never got around to telling you during our brief
meeting. It was I who sent you the Firebolt —
“Ha!” said Hermione triumphantly. “See! I 
told
 you it was from him!”
“Yes, but he hadn’t jinxed it, had he?” said Ron. “Ouch!”
The tiny owl, now hooting happily in his hand, had nibbled one of hisfingers in what it seemed to think was an affectionate way.
Crookshanks took the order to the Owl Office  sick of finding everything out from the
Slytherins.”
“Good thinking!” said Harry, also looking up at the owls. “Hey, Hermione,
I think you’re in luck —”
A gray owl was soaring down toward Hermione.“It hasn’t got a newspaper, though,” she said, looking disappointed. “It’s
—”
But to her bewilderment, the gray owl landed in front of her plate, closely
followed by four barn owls, a brown owl, and a tawny.
“How many subscriptions did you take out?” said Harry, seizing
Hermione’s goblet before it was knocked over by the cluster of owls, all of
whom were jostling close to her, trying to deliver their own letter first.
“What on earth — ?” Hermione said, taking the letter from the gray owl,
opening it, and starting to read. “Oh really!” she sputtered, going rather red.
“What’s up?” said Ron.
“It’s — oh how ridiculous —”
She thrust the letter at Harry, who saw that it was not handwritten, but
composed from pasted letters that seemed to have been cut out of the 
Daily
Prophet.
You are a WickEd giRL. HarRy PotTER desErve rs of his name rearranged
themselves:
I AM LORD VOLDEMORT
“You see?” he whispered. “It was a name I was already using at Hogwarts,
to my most intimate friends only, of course. You think I was going to use my
filthy Muggle father’s name forever? I, in whose veins runs the blood of
Salazar Slytherin himself, through my mother’s side? I, keep the name of a
foul, common Muggle, who abandoned me even before I was born, just
because he found out his wife was a witch? No, Harry — I fashioned myself a
new name, a name I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak,when I had become the greatest sorcerer in the world!”
Harry’s brain seemed to have jammed. He stared numbly at Riddle, at the
orphaned boy who had grown up to murder Harry’s own parents, and so many
others. . . . At last he forced himself to speak.
“You’re not,” he said, his quiet voice full of hatred.
“Not what?” snapped Riddle.
“Not the greatest sorcerer in the world,” said Harry, breathing fast. “Sorry
to disappoint you and all that, but the grea  as though a large balloon was
swelling inside him. He went straight to the window and jerked it open. The
owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of Hagrid, who didn’t
wake up. The owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to attack Hagrid’scoat.
“Don’t do that.”
Harry tried to wave the owl out of the way, but it snapped its beak fiercely
at him and carried on savaging the coat.
“Hagrid!” said Harry loudly. “There’s an owl —”
“Pay him,” Hagrid grunted into the sofa.
“What?”
“He wants payin’ fer deliverin’ the paper. Look in the pockets.”
Hagrid’s coat seemed to be made of nothing 
but
 pockets — bunches of
keys, slug pellets, balls of string, peppermint humbugs, teabags . . . finally,
Harry pulled out a handful of strange-looking coins.
“Give him five Knuts,” said Hagrid sleepily.
“Knuts?”
“The little bronze ones.”
Harry counted out five little bronze coins, and the owl held out his leg so
Harry could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to it. Then he flew
off through the open window.
Hag zard
of all time? How did 
you
 escape with nothing but a scar, while Lord
Voldemort’s powers were destroyed?”
There was an odd red gleam in his hungry eyes now.
“Why do you care how I escaped?” said Harry slowly. “Voldemort was
after your time. . . .”
“Voldemort,” said Riddle softly, “is my past, present, and future, Harry
Potter. . . .”
He pulled Harry’s wand from his pocket and began to trace it through the
air, writing three shimmering words:
TOM MARVOLO RIDDLE
Then he waved the wand once, and the letters of his name rearranged
themselves:
I AM LORD VOLDEMORT
“You see?” he whispered. “It was a name I was already using at Hogwarts,

Who is the headmaster of Hogwarts?,Albus Dumbledore,"According to the passage, Severus Snape is the new Headmaster of Hogwarts.","dunno . . . Hogwarts without Dumbledore . . .” He gulped and
disappeared behind his handkerchief once more, and there was silence.
“Very well,” said Professor McGonagall, glancing out of the window at thegrounds, checking to see whether the Minister was yet approaching, “then I
must agree with Filius that the right thing to do is to consult the governors,
who will make the final decision.
“Now, as to getting students home . . . there is an argument for doing it
sooner rather than later. We could arrange for the Hogwarts Express to come
tomorrow if necessary —”
“What about Dumbledore’s funeral?” said Harry, speaking at last.
“Well . . .” said Professor McGonagall, losing a little of her briskness as her
voice shook. “I — I know that it was Dumbledore’s wish to be laid to rest
here, at Hogwarts —”
“Then that’s what’ll happen, isn’t it?” said Harry fiercely.
“If the Ministry thinks it appropriate,” said Professor McGonagall. “No
other headmaster or headmistress has ever been —”
“No other headmaster or headmistre red
parchment.
A large picture of a familiar, hook-nosed, black-haired man stared up at
them all, beneath a headline that read:
SEVERUS SNAPE CONFIRMED AS HOGWARTS HEADMASTER
“No!” said Ron and Hermione loudly.
Hermione was quickest; she snatched up the newspaper and began to read
the accompanying story out loud.
“‘Severus Snape, long-standing Potions master at Hogwarts School of
Witchcraft and Wizardry, was today appointed headmaster in the most
important of several staffing changes at the ancient school. Following the
resignation of the previous Muggle Studies teacher, Alecto Carrow will take
over the post while her brother, Amycus, fills the position of Defense Against
the Dark Arts professor.
“
‘I welcome the opportunity to uphold our finest Wizarding traditions and
values —’ 
Like committing murder and cutting off people’s ears, I suppose!
Snape, headmaster! Snape in Dumbledore’s study — Merlin’s pants!” she
shrieked, making both Harry and Ron jump. She leapt up from the table and
hurtled from the room,  he had just been appointed Head Boy. Harry didn’t realize what he was so
pleased about until the Potions lesson about two weeks after Dumbledore and
Hagrid had left, when, sitting right behind Malfoy, Harry overheard him
gloating to Crabbe and Goyle.
“I always thought Father might be the one who got rid of Dumbledore,” he
said, not troubling to keep his voice down. “I told you he thinks
Dumbledore’s the worst headmaster the school’s ever had. Maybe we’ll get a
decent headmaster now. Someone who won’t 
want
 the Chamber of Secrets
closed. McGonagall won’t last long, she’s only filling in. . . .”
Snape swept past Harry, making no comment about Hermione’s empty seat
and cauldron.
“Sir,” said Malfoy loudly. “Sir, why don’t 
you 
apply for the headmaster’s
job?”
“Now, now, Malfoy,” said Snape, though he couldn’t suppress a thin-lipped
smile. “Professor Dumbledore has only been suspended by the governors. I
daresay he’ll be back with us soon enough.”
“Yeah, right,” said Malfoy, smirking. “I expect you’d have Father ersonally!
Lots of love,
Snape took the page bearing Lily’s signature, and her love, and tucked it
inside his robes. Then he ripped in two the photograph he was also holding,
so that he kept the part from which Lily laughed, throwing the portion
showing James and Harry back onto the floor, under the chest of drawers. . . .
And now Snape stood again in the headmaster’s study as Phineas Nigellus
came hurrying into his portrait.
“Headmaster! They are camping in the Forest of Dean! The Mudblood —”
“Do not use that word!”
“— the Granger girl, then, mentioned the place as she opened her bag and I
heard her!”
“Good. Very good!” cried the portrait of Dumbledore behind the
headmaster’s chair. “Now, Severus, the sword! Do not forget that it must be
taken under conditions of need and valor — and he must not know that you
give it! If Voldemort should read Harry’s mind and see you acting for him —”“I know,” said Snape curtly. He approached the portrait of Dumbledore and
pulled at its side. It swung forward, revealing a hi  the Hogwarts Express to come
tomorrow if necessary —”
“What about Dumbledore’s funeral?” said Harry, speaking at last.
“Well . . .” said Professor McGonagall, losing a little of her briskness as her
voice shook. “I — I know that it was Dumbledore’s wish to be laid to rest
here, at Hogwarts —”
“Then that’s what’ll happen, isn’t it?” said Harry fiercely.
“If the Ministry thinks it appropriate,” said Professor McGonagall. “No
other headmaster or headmistress has ever been —”
“No other headmaster or headmistress ever gave more to this school,”
growled Hagrid.
“Hogwarts should be Dumbledore’s final resting place,” said Professor
Flitwick.
“Absolutely,” said Professor Sprout.
“And in that case,” said Harry, “you shouldn’t send the students home until
the funeral’s over. They’ll want to say —”
The last word caught in his throat, but Professor Sprout completed the
sentence for him.
“Good-bye.”
“Well said,” squeaked Professor Flitwick. “Well said indeed! Our students
should pay tribute, it is fitting. We can arrange  thoughts, and he did not slow down until he
reached the stone gargoyle guarding the headmaster’s office.
“Password?”
“Dumbledore!” said Harry without thinking, because it was he whom he
yearned to see, and to his surprise the gargoyle slid aside, revealing the spiral
staircase behind.
But when Harry burst into the circular office he found a change. Theportraits that hung all around the walls were empty. Not a single headmaster
or headmistress remained to see him; all, it seemed, had flitted away, charging
through the paintings that lined the castle, so that they could have a clear view
of what was going on.
Harry glanced hopelessly at Dumbledore’s deserted frame, which hung
directly behind the headmaster’s chair, then turned his back on it. The stone
Pensieve lay in the cabinet where it had always been: Harry heaved it onto the
desk and poured Snape’s memories into the wide basin with its runic
markings around the edge. To escape into someone else’s head would be a
blessed relief. . . . Nothing that even Snap werewolf Remus Lupin, half-giant Rubeus Hagrid, and delusional
ex-Auror ‘Mad-Eye’ Moody.
“Rumors abound, of course, that Albus Dumbledore, once Supreme
Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards and Chief Warlock
of the Wizengamot, is no longer up to the task of managing the prestigious
school of Hogwarts.
“‘I think the appointment of the Inquisitor is a first step toward ensuring
that Hogwarts has a headmaster in whom we can all repose confidence,’ said
a Ministry insider last night.
“Wizengamot elders Griselda Marchbanks and Tiberius Ogden have
resigned in protest at the introduction of the post of Inquisitor to Hogwarts.
“‘Hogwarts is a school, not an outpost of Cornelius Fudge’s office,’ said
Madam Marchbanks. ‘This is a further disgusting attempt to discredit Albus
Dumbledore.’ (For a full account of Madam Marchbanks’ alleged links to
subversive goblin groups, turn to page 17.)”
Hermione finished reading and looked across the table at the other two.
“So now we know how we ended up with Umbridg you please, Master Harry, and hands washed before dinner,”
croaked Kreacher, seizing the Invisibility Cloak and slouching off to hang iton a hook on the wall, beside a number of old-fashioned robes that had been
freshly laundered.
“What’s happened?” Ron asked apprehensively. He and Hermione had
been poring over a sheaf of scribbled notes and hand-drawn maps that littered
the end of the long kitchen table, but now they watched Harry as he strode
toward them and threw down the newspaper on top of their scattered
parchment.
A large picture of a familiar, hook-nosed, black-haired man stared up at
them all, beneath a headline that read:
SEVERUS SNAPE CONFIRMED AS HOGWARTS HEADMASTER
“No!” said Ron and Hermione loudly.
Hermione was quickest; she snatched up the newspaper and began to read
the accompanying story out loud.
“‘Severus Snape, long-standing Potions master at Hogwarts School of
Witchcraft and Wizardry, was today appointed headmaster in the most
important of several staffing changes at the ancient school. "

The passage only mentions that Lockhart told the students to cast their charms to Disarm their opponents, but it doesn't specify the exact spell used."," Slytherin girl who
reminded Harry of a picture he’d seen in 
Holidays with Hags.
 She was large
and square and her heavy jaw jutted aggressively. Hermione gave her a weak
smile that she did not return.
“Face your partners!” called Lockhart, back on the platform. “And bow!”
Harry and Malfoy barely inclined their heads, not taking their eyes off each
other.
“Wands at the ready!” shouted Lockhart. “When I count to three, cast your
charms to Disarm your opponents — 
only
 to disarm them — we don’t want
any accidents — one . . . two . . . three —”
Harry swung his wand high, but Malfoy had already started on “two”: His
spell hit Harry so hard he felt as though he’d been hit over the head with a
saucepan. He stumbled, but everything still seemed to be working, and
wasting no more time, Harry pointed his wand straight at Malfoy and shouted,
“Rictusempra!”A jet of silver light hit Malfoy in the stomach and he doubled up, wheezing.
“I said Disarm only!”
 Lockhart shouted in alarm over the heads of the
battling crowd,  it before — I DID IT!”
“Good one!” said Harry encouragingly, deciding not to point out that in a
real duel situation Neville’s opponent was unlikely to be staring in the
opposite direction with his wand held loosely at his side. “Listen, Neville, can
you take it in turns to practice with Ron and Hermione for a couple of minutes
so I can walk around and see how the rest are doing?”
Harry moved off into the middle of the room. Something very odd was
happening to Zacharias Smith; every time he opened his mouth to disarm
Anthony Goldstein, his own wand would fly out of his hand, yet Anthony did
not seem to be making a sound. Harry did not have to look far for the solution
of the mystery, however; Fred and George were several feet from Smith and
taking it in turns to point their wands at his back.
“Sorry, Harry,” said George hastily, when Harry caught his eye. “Couldn’t
resist . . .”
Harry walked around the other pairs, trying to correct those who were
doing the spell wrong. Ginny was teamed with Michael Corner; s ed through the crowd, matching up partners. Lockhart teamed
Neville with Justin Finch-Fletchley, but Snape reached Harry and Ron first.
“Time to split up the dream team, I think,” he sneered. “Weasley, you can
partner Finnigan. Potter —”
Harry moved automatically toward Hermione.
“I don’t think so,” said Snape, smiling coldly. “Mr. Malfoy, come over
here. Let’s see what you make of the famous Potter. And you, Miss Granger
— you can partner Miss Bulstrode.”
Malfoy strutted over, smirking. Behind him walked a Slytherin girl who
reminded Harry of a picture he’d seen in 
Holidays with Hags.
 She was large
and square and her heavy jaw jutted aggressively. Hermione gave her a weak
smile that she did not return.
“Face your partners!” called Lockhart, back on the platform. “And bow!”
Harry and Malfoy barely inclined their heads, not taking their eyes off each
other.
“Wands at the ready!” shouted Lockhart. “When I count to three, cast your

only

tried this on Crabbe in the corridor, with very entertaining results); a jinx that
glued the tongue to the roof of the mouth (which he had twice used, to general
applause, on an unsuspecting Argus Filch); and, perhaps most useful of all,
Muffliato,
 a spell that filled the ears of anyone nearby with an unidentifiable
buzzing, so that lengthy conversations could be held in class without being
overheard. The only person who did not find these charms amusing was
Hermione, who maintained a rigidly disapproving expression throughout and
refused to talk at all if Harry had used the 
Muffliato
 spell on anyone in the
vicinity.
Sitting up in bed, Harry turned the book sideways so as to examine more
closely the scribbled instructions for a spell that seemed to have caused the
Prince some trouble. There were many crossings-out and alterations, but
finally, crammed into a corner of the page, the scribble:
Levicorpus (nvbl)
While the wind and sleet pounded relen  briefly how the Death Eaters pursuing them had seemed to
recognize him as the true Harry, how they had abandoned the chase, how they
must have summoned Voldemort, who had appeared just before he and
Hagrid had reached the sanctuary of Tonks’s parents.
“They recognized you? But how? What had you done?”
“I . . .” Harry tried to remember; the whole journey seemed like a blur of
panic and confusion. “I saw Stan Shunpike. . . . You know, the bloke who was
the conductor on the Knight Bus? And I tried to Disarm him instead of —
well, he doesn’t know what he’s doing, does he? He must be Imperiused!”
Lupin looked aghast.
“Harry, the time for Disarming is past! These people are trying to capture
and kill you! At least Stun if you aren’t prepared to kill!”
“We were hundreds of feet up! Stan’s not himself, and if I Stunned him and
he’d fallen, he’d have died the same as if I’d used Avada Kedavra!
Expelliarmus saved me from Voldemort two years ago,” Harry added
defiantly. Lupin was reminding him of the sneering Hufflepuf , from which Harry retrieved it with a Summoning Charm.
Glancing around he thought he had been right to suggest that they practice the
basics first; there was a lot of shoddy spellwork going on; many people were
not succeeding in disarming their opponents at all, but merely causing them to
jump backward a few paces or wince as the feeble spell whooshed over them.“Expelliarmus!” 
said Neville, and Harry, caught unawares, felt his wand
fly out of his hand.
“I DID IT!” said Neville gleefully. “I’ve never done it before — I DID IT!”
“Good one!” said Harry encouragingly, deciding not to point out that in a
real duel situation Neville’s opponent was unlikely to be staring in the
opposite direction with his wand held loosely at his side. “Listen, Neville, can
you take it in turns to practice with Ron and Hermione for a couple of minutes
so I can walk around and see how the rest are doing?”
Harry moved off into the middle of the room. Something very odd was
happening to Zacharias Smith; every time he opened his mouth e. . . .
“Harry,” said Hermione, “how can you still stick up for that book when that
spell 
—”
“Will you stop harping on about the book!” snapped Harry. “The Prince
only copied it out! It’s not like he was advising anyone to use it! For all we
know, he was making a note of something that had been used against him!”
“I don’t believe this,” said Hermione. “You’re actually defending —”
“I’m not defending what I did!” said Harry quickly. “I wish I hadn’t done
it, and not just because I’ve got about a dozen detentions. You know I
wouldn’t’ve used a spell like that, not even on Malfoy, but you can’t blame
the Prince, he hadn’t written ‘try this out, it’s really good’ — he was just
making notes for himself, wasn’t he, not for anyone else. . . .”
“Are you telling me,” said Hermione, “that you’re going to go back — ?”
“And get the book? Yeah, I am,” said Harry forcefully. “Listen, without the
Prince I’d never have won the Felix Felicis. I’d never have known how to
save Ron from poisoning, I’d never have —”
“— got a re f Zacharias
Smith, who had jeered at Harry for wanting to teach Dumbledore’s Army how
to Disarm.
“Yes, Harry,” said Lupin with painful restraint, “and a great number of
Death Eaters witnessed that happening! Forgive me, but it was a very unusual
move then, under imminent threat of death. Repeating it tonight in front of
Death Eaters who either witnessed or heard about the first occasion was close
to suicidal!”
“So you think I should have killed Stan Shunpike?” said Harry angrily.
“Of course not,” said Lupin, “but the Death Eaters — frankly, most people!
— would have expected you to attack back! Expelliarmus is a useful spell,
Harry, but the Death Eaters seem to think it is your signature move, and I urgeyou not to let it become so!”
Lupin was making Harry feel idiotic, and yet there was still a grain of
defiance inside him.
“I won’t blast people out of my way just because they’re there,” said Harry.
“That’s Voldemort’s job.”
Lupin’s retort was lost: Finally succeeding in squeezing through the door,

“Those two Death Eaters who teach here?”
“They do more than teach,” said Neville. “They’re in charge of all
discipline. They like punishment, the Carrows.”
“Like Umbridge?”
“Nah, they make her look tame. The other teachers are all supposed to refer
us to the Carrows if we do anything wrong. They don’t, though, if they can
avoid it. You can tell they all hate them as much as we do.
“Amycus, the bloke, he teaches what used to be Defense Against the Dark
Arts, except now it’s just the Dark Arts. We’re supposed to practice the
Cruciatus Curse on people who’ve earned detentions —”
“What?”
Harry, Ron, and Hermione’s united voices echoed up and down the
passage.
“Yeah,” said Neville. “That’s how I got this one,” he pointed at a
particularly deep gash in his cheek, “I refused to do it. Some people are into

his big waistcoated belly casting the table below into shadow — “is a former

“Potions?”
“Potions?”
The word echoed all over the Hall as people wondered whether they had
heard right.
“Potions?” said Ron and Hermione together, turning to stare at Harry. “But
you said —”
“Professor Snape, meanwhile,” said Dumbledore, raising his voice so that it
carried over all the muttering, “will be taking over the position of Defense
Against the Dark Arts teacher.”
“No!” said Harry, so loudly that many heads turned in his direction. He didnot care; he was staring up at the staff table, incensed. How could Snape be
given the Defense Against the Dark Arts job after all this time? Hadn’t it been
widely known for years that Dumbledore did it by now, though . . . or
Madam Pomfrey would’ve done.”

“Potions?”
“Potions?”
The word echoed all over the Hall as people wondered whether they had
heard right.
“Potions?” said Ron and Hermione t se,
and sallow skin.
It happened very suddenly. The hook-nosed teacher looked past Quirrell’s
turban straight into Harry’s eyes — and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar
on Harry’s forehead.
“Ouch!” Harry clapped a hand to his head.
“What is it?” asked Percy.
“N-nothing.”
The pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder to shake off was the
feeling Harry had gotten from the teacher’s look — a feeling that he didn’t
like Harry at all.
“Who’s that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?” he asked Percy.
“Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder he’s looking so
nervous, that’s Professor Snape. He teaches Potions, but he doesn’t want to —
everyone knows he’s after Quirrell’s job. Knows an awful lot about the Dark
Arts, Snape.”
Harry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn’t look at him again.
At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to his
feet again. The hall fell silent.
“Ahem — just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I

“First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all
pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember that aswell.”
Dumbledore’s twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley twins.
“I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that
no magic should be used between classes in the corridors.
“Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone
interested in playing for their House teams should contact Mad tal wing.”
The second years were given something new to think about during their
Easter holidays. The time had come to choose their subjects for the third year,
a matter that Hermione, at least, took very seriously.“It could affect our whole future,” she told Harry and Ron as they pored
over lists of new subjects, marking them with checks.
“I just want to give up Potions,” said Harry.
“We can’t,” said Ron gloomily. “We keep all our old subjects, or I’d’ve
ditched Defense Against the Dark Arts.”
“But that’s very important!” said Hermione, shocked.
“Not the way Lockhart teaches it,” said Ron. “I haven’t learned anything
from him except not to set pixies loose.”
Neville Longbottom had been sent letters from all the witches and wizards
in his family, all giving him different advice on what to choose. Confused and
worried, he sat reading the subject lists with his tongue poking out, asking
people whether they thought Arithmancy sounded more difficult than Study
of Ancient Runes. Dean Thomas, who, like Harry, had g inny,” said Ron, whose ears were now reddening.

“Five points from Gryffindor!” Percy said tersely, fingering his prefect
badge. “And I hope it teaches you a lesson! No more 
detective work,
 or I’ll
write to Mum!”
And he strode off, the back of his neck as red as Ron’s ears.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione chose seats as far as possible from Percy in the
common room that night. Ron was still in a very bad temper and kept blotting
his Charms homework. When he reached absently for his wand to remove the
smudges, it ignited the parchment. Fuming almost as much as his homework,
Ron slammed 
The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 2
 shut. To Harry’s surprise,
Hermione followed suit.
“Who can it be, though?” she said in a quiet voice, as though continuing a
conversation they had just been having. “Who’d 
want
 to frighten all the
Squibs and Muggle-borns out of Hogwarts?”
“Let’s think,” said Ron in mock puzzlement. “Who do we know who thinks
Muggle-b ille laughed gleefully.
“What did you do with the dragon?”
“Released it into the wild,” said Ron. “Hermione was all for keeping it as a
pet —”
“Don’t exaggerate, Ron —”
“But what have you been doing? People have been saying you’ve just been
on the run, Harry, but I don’t think so. I think you’ve been up to something.”
“You’re right,” said Harry, “but tell us about Hogwarts, Neville, we haven’theard anything.”
“It’s been . . . well, it’s not really like Hogwarts anymore,” said Neville, the
smile fading from his face as he spoke. “Do you know about the Carrows?”
“Those two Death Eaters who teach here?”

What is the name of the Weasley's house?,The Burrow,I can help you with that! The Weasley family lives in a house called the Burrow.," you are here, your House will be something like
your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your
House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free time in your House
common room.
“The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and
Slytherin. Each House has its own noble history and each has produced
outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs
will earn your House points, while any rule-breaking will lose House points.
At the end of the year, the House with the most points is awarded the House
Cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever House
becomes yours.
“The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest
of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can
while you are waiting.”
Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville’s cloak, which was fastened
under his left ear, and on Ron’s smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to
flatten his hair.
“I shall return when we are r rs of his name rearranged
themselves:
I AM LORD VOLDEMORT
“You see?” he whispered. “It was a name I was already using at Hogwarts,
to my most intimate friends only, of course. You think I was going to use my
filthy Muggle father’s name forever? I, in whose veins runs the blood of
Salazar Slytherin himself, through my mother’s side? I, keep the name of a
foul, common Muggle, who abandoned me even before I was born, just
because he found out his wife was a witch? No, Harry — I fashioned myself a
new name, a name I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak,when I had become the greatest sorcerer in the world!”
Harry’s brain seemed to have jammed. He stared numbly at Riddle, at the
orphaned boy who had grown up to murder Harry’s own parents, and so many
others. . . . At last he forced himself to speak.
“You’re not,” he said, his quiet voice full of hatred.
“Not what?” snapped Riddle.
“Not the greatest sorcerer in the world,” said Harry, breathing fast. “Sorry
to disappoint you and all that, but the grea ,” Vernon Dursley said now, resuming his pacing up and
down the living room, “we — Petunia, Dudley, and I — are in danger. From
— from —”
“Some of ‘my lot,’ right,” said Harry.
“Well, I don’t believe it,” repeated Uncle Vernon, coming to a halt in front
of Harry again. “I was awake half the night thinking it all over, and I believe
it’s a plot to get the house.”
“The house?” repeated Harry. “What house?”
“
This 
house!” shrieked Uncle Vernon, the vein in his forehead starting to
pulse. “
Our
 house! House prices are skyrocketing around here! You want us
out of the way and then you’re going to do a bit of hocus-pocus and before weknow it the deeds will be in your name and —”
“Are you out of your mind?” demanded Harry. “A plot to get this house?
Are you actually as stupid as you look?”
“Don’t you dare — !” squealed Aunt Petunia, but again, Vernon waved her
down: Slights on his personal appearance were, it seemed, as nothing to the
danger he had spotted.
“Just in case you’ve forgotten,” said Harry, “I’ve already  are, dear. . . .”
“Harry,” said Mr. Weasley quietly, “come over here a moment.”
He jerked his head toward a pillar, and Harry followed him behind it,
leaving the others crowded around Mrs. Weasley.“There’s something I’ve got to tell you before you leave —” said Mr.
Weasley, in a tense voice.
“It’s all right, Mr. Weasley,” said Harry. “I already know.”
“You know? How could you know?”
“I — er — I heard you and Mrs. Weasley talking last night. I couldn’t help
hearing,” Harry added quickly. “Sorry —”
“That’s not the way I’d have chosen for you to find out,” said Mr. Weasley,
looking anxious.
“No — honestly, it’s okay. This way, you haven’t broken your word to
Fudge and I know what’s going on.”
“Harry, you must be very scared —”
“I’m not,” said Harry sincerely. 
“Really,”
 he added, because Mr. Weasley
was looking disbelieving. “I’m not trying to be a hero, but seriously, Sirius
Black can’t be worse than Voldemort, can he?”
Mr. Weasley flinched at the sound of the name but overlooked it.
“Harry, I knew you were,  rom a doorway to the right — the
rest of the school must already be here — but Professor McGonagall showed
the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in,
standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering
about nervously.
“Welcome to Hogwarts,” said Professor McGonagall. “The start-of-term
banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall,
you will be sorted into your Houses. The Sorting is a very importantceremony because, while you are here, your House will be something like
your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your

At the end of the zard
of all time? How did 
you
 escape with nothing but a scar, while Lord
Voldemort’s powers were destroyed?”
There was an odd red gleam in his hungry eyes now.
“Why do you care how I escaped?” said Harry slowly. “Voldemort was
after your time. . . .”
“Voldemort,” said Riddle softly, “is my past, present, and future, Harry
Potter. . . .”
He pulled Harry’s wand from his pocket and began to trace it through the
air, writing three shimmering words:
TOM MARVOLO RIDDLE
Then he waved the wand once, and the letters of his name rearranged
themselves:
I AM LORD VOLDEMORT
“You see?” he whispered. “It was a name I was already using at Hogwarts,
to my most intimate friends only, of course. You think I was going to use my
filthy Muggle father’s name forever? I, in whose veins runs the blood of
Salazar Slytherin himself, through my mother’s side? I, keep the name of a

“Black family tradition decreed that the house was handed down the direct
line, to the next male with the name of ‘Black.’ Sirius was the very last of the
line as his younger brother, Regulus, predeceased him and both were
childless. While his will makes it perfectly plain that he wants you to have the
house, it is nevertheless possible that some spell or enchantment has been set
upon the place to ensure that it cannot be owned by anyone other than a
pureblood.”
A vivid image of the shrieking, spitting portrait of Sirius’s mother that hung
in the hall of number twelve, Grimmauld Place flashed into Harry’s mind. “I
bet there has,” he said.
“Quite,” said Dumbledore. “And if such an enchantment exists, then the
ownership of the house is most likely to pass to the eldest of Sirius’s living
relatives, which would mean his cousin, Bellatrix Lestrange.”
Without realizing what he was doing, Harry sprang to his feet; the
telescope and trainers in his lap rolled across the fl till

Malfoy looked up.
“Imagine them not even getting his name right, Weasley. It’s almost as
though he’s a complete nonentity, isn’t it?” he crowed.
Everyone in the entrance hall was listening now. Malfoy straightened the
paper with a flourish and read on:
Arnold Weasley, who was charged with possession of a flying car
two years ago, was yesterday involved in a tussle with several
Muggle law-keepers (“policemen”) over a number of highly
aggressive dustbins. Mr. Weasley appears to have rushed to the aid
of “Mad-Eye” Moody, the aged ex-Auror who retired from the
Ministry when no longer able to tell the difference between a
handshake and attempted murder. Unsurprisingly, Mr. Weasley
found, upon arrival at Mr. Moody’s heavily guarded house, that Mr.Moody had once again raised a false alarm. Mr. Weasley was forced

CHAPTER  ONE
THE BOY WHO LIVED
r. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say
that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much now-Who’s sign!”
“Voldemort’s — ?”
“Harry, come 
on
!”
Harry turned — Ron was hurriedly scooping up his miniature Krum — the
three of them started across the clearing — but before they had taken a few
hurried steps, a series of popping noises announced the arrival of twenty
wizards, appearing from thin air, surrounding them.
Harry whirled around, and in an instant, he registered one fact: Each of
these wizards had his wand out, and every wand was pointing right at himself,
Ron, and Hermione.
Without pausing to think, he yelled, “DUCK!”
He seized the other two and pulled them down onto the ground.
“STUPEFY!”
 roared twenty voices — there was a blinding series of
flashes and Harry felt the hair on his head ripple as though a powerful wind
had swept the clearing. Raising his head a fraction of an inch he saw jets of
fiery red light flying over them from the wizards’ wands, crossing one
another, bouncing off tree trunks, rebounding into the darkness —
“Stop!” yelled a voice he recognized. “STOP! 
That’s my son!
” hen she reached the end of the page she looked up at him.
“Oh, Harry . . .”“And there’s this too.”
He handed her the torn photograph, and Hermione smiled at the baby
zooming in and out of sight on the toy broom.
“I’ve been looking for the rest of the letter,” Harry said, “but it’s not here.”
Hermione glanced around.
“Did you make all this mess, or was some of it done when you got here?”
“Someone had searched before me,” said Harry.
“I thought so. Every room I looked into on the way up had been disturbed.
What were they after, do you think?”
“Information on the Order, if it was Snape.”
“But you’d think he’d already have all he needed, I mean, he was 
in 
the
Order, wasn’t he?”
“Well then,” said Harry, keen to discuss his theory, “what about
information on Dumbledore? The second page of this letter, for instance. You
know this Bathilda my mum mentions, you know who she is?”
“Who?”
“Bathilda Bagshot, the author of —”
“
A History of Magic,
” said Hermione, looking interested. “So your parents
knew her? She was an at were they after, do you think?”
“Information on the Order, if it was Snape.”
“But you’d think he’d already have all he needed, I mean, he was 
in 
the
Order, wasn’t he?”
“Well then,” said Harry, keen to discuss his theory, “what about
information on Dumbledore? The second page of this letter, for instance. You
know this Bathilda my mum mentions, you know who she is?”
“Who?”
“Bathilda Bagshot, the author of —”
“
A History of Magic,
” said Hermione, looking interested. “So your parents
knew her? She was an incredible magical historian.”
“And she’s still alive,” said Harry, “and she lives in Godric’s Hollow, Ron’s
Auntie Muriel was talking about her at the wedding. She knew Dumbledore’s
family too. Be pretty interesting to talk to, wouldn’t she?”
There was a little too much understanding in the smile Hermione gave him
for Harry’s liking. He took back the letter and the photograph and tucked
them inside the pouch around his neck, so as not to have to look at her and
give himself away.
“I understand why you’d l . Again, your readers will have to buy my book for the
whole story, but there is no question that Dumbledore took an unnatural
interest in Potter from the word go. Whether that was really in the boy’s
best interests — well, we’ll see. It’s certainly an open secret that Potter
has had a most troubled adolescence.”
I ask whether Skeeter is still in touch with Harry Potter, whom she so
famously interviewed last year: a breakthrough piece in which Potter
spoke exclusively of his conviction that You-Know-Who had returned.
“Oh, yes, we’ve developed a close bond,” says Skeeter. “Poor Potter
has few real friends, and we met at one of the most testing moments of
his life — the Triwizard Tournament. I am probably one of the only
people alive who can say that they know the real Harry Potter.”
Which leads us neatly to the many rumors still circulating about
Dumbledore’s final hours. Does Skeeter believe that Potter was there
when Dumbledore died?
“Well, I don’t want to say too much — it’s all in the book — but
eyewitness  Slughorn led him purposefully into the party; Harry seized Luna’s
hand and dragged her along with him.
“Harry, I’d like you to meet Eldred Worple, an old student of mine, author
of 
Blood Brothers: My Life Amongst the Vampires —
 and, of course, his friend
Sanguini.”
Worple, who was a small, stout, bespectacled man, grabbed Harry’s hand
and shook it enthusiastically; the vampire Sanguini, who was tall andemaciated with dark shadows under his eyes, merely nodded. He looked
rather bored. A gaggle of girls was standing close to him, looking curious and
excited.
“Harry Potter, I am simply delighted!” said Worple, peering shortsightedly
up into Harry’s face. “I was saying to Professor Slughorn only the other day,
‘Where is the biography of Harry Potter for which we have all been
waiting?’
”
“Er,” said Harry, “were you?”
“Just as modest as Horace described!” said Worple. “But seriously” — his
manner changed; it became suddenly businesslike — “I would be delighted to
write it myself — people are craving to know mor  appearance of the
skull, which had now risen high enough to illuminate the entire wood like
some grisly neon sign. He scanned the darkness for the person who had
conjured the skull, but he couldn’t see anyone.
“Who’s there?” he called again.
“Harry, come on, 
move
!” Hermione had seized the collar of his jacket and
was tugging him backward.
“What’s the matter?” Harry said, startled to see her face so white and
terrified.
“It’s the Dark Mark, Harry!” Hermione moaned, pulling him as hard as she
could. “You-Know-Who’s sign!”
“Voldemort’s — ?”
“Harry, come 
on
!”
Harry turned — Ron was hurriedly scooping up his miniature Krum — the
three of them started across the clearing — but before they had taken a few
hurried steps, a series of popping noises announced the arrival of twenty
wizards, appearing from thin air, surrounding them.
Harry whirled around, and in an instant, he registered one fact: Each of
these wizards had his wand out, and every wand was pointing right at himself,
Ron, and Hermione.
Without pausing f them. “Trying to pretend it hasn’t happened?”
“Get out,” said Harry.He had not been this close to Malfoy since he had watched him muttering
to Crabbe and Goyle during Dumbledore’s speech about Cedric. He could feel
a kind of ringing in his ears. His hand gripped his wand under his robes.
“You’ve picked the losing side, Potter! I warned you! I told you you ought
to choose your company more carefully, remember? When we met on the
train, first day at Hogwarts? I told you not to hang around with riffraff like
this!” He jerked his head at Ron and Hermione. “Too late now, Potter! They’ll
be the first to go, now the Dark Lord’s back! Mudbloods and Muggle-lovers
first! Well — second — Diggory was the f —”
It was as though someone had exploded a box of fireworks within the
compartment. Blinded by the blaze of the spells that had blasted from every
direction, deafened by a series of bangs, Harry blinked and looked down at
the floor.
Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle were all lying unconscious in the doorway. He,
Ron, and Her"

trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him. Harry thought this
was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, facing the platforms
with a nasty grin on his face.
“Well, there you are, boy. Platform nine — platform ten. Your platform
should be somewhere in the middle, but they don’t seem to have built it yet,
do they?”
He was quite right, of course. There was a big plastic number nine over one
platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it, and in the
middle, nothing at all.
“Have a good term,” said Uncle Vernon with an even nastier smile. He left
without another word. Harry turned and saw the Dursleys drive away. All
three of them were laughing. Harry’s mouth went rather dry. What on earth
was he going to do? He was starting to attract a lot of funny looks, because of
Hedwig. He’d have to ask someone.
He stopped a passing guard, but didn’t dare mention platform nine and
three-quarters. The guard had never heard of Hogwarts and when Harry
couldn’t even tell him ough onto
platform nine and three quarters, where the Hogwarts Express stood belching
sooty steam over a platform packed with departing students and their families.Harry inhaled the familiar smell and felt his spirits soar. . . . He was really
going back. . . .
“I hope the others make it in time,” said Mrs. Weasley anxiously, staring
behind her at the wrought-iron arch spanning the platform, through which
new arrivals would come.
“Nice dog, Harry!” called a tall boy with dreadlocks.
“Thanks, Lee,” said Harry, grinning, as Sirius wagged his tail frantically.
“Oh good,” said Mrs. Weasley, sounding relieved, “here’s Alastor with the
luggage, look . . .”
A porter’s cap pulled low over his mismatched eyes, Moody came limping
through the archway pushing a cart full of their trunks.
“All okay,” he muttered to Mrs. Weasley and Tonks. “Don’t think we were
followed . . .”
Seconds later, Mr. Weasley emerged onto the platform with Ron and
Hermione. They had almost unloaded Moody’s luggage cart when Fred,
George, and Ginn  ten. The only tricky part was doing this in an
unobtrusive way, so as to avoid attracting Muggle attention. They did it in
groups today; Harry, Ron, and Hermione (the most conspicuous, since they
were accompanied by Pigwidgeon and Crookshanks) went first; they leaned
casually against the barrier, chatting unconcernedly, and slid sideways
through it . . . and as they did so, platform nine and three-quarters
materialized in front of them.
The Hogwarts Express, a gleaming scarlet steam engine, was already there,
clouds of steam billowing from it, through which the many Hogwarts students
and parents on the platform appeared like dark ghosts. Pigwidgeon became
noisier than ever in response to the hooting of many owls through the mist.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione set off to find seats, and were soon stowing their
luggage in a compartment halfway along the train. They then hopped back
down onto the platform to say good-bye to Mrs. Weasley, Bill, and Charlie.
“I might be seeing you all sooner than you think,” said Char d.
They didn’t talk much during the remainder of the journey. At long last, the
train stopped at Hogsmeade station, and there was a great scramble to get
outside; owls hooted, cats meowed, and Neville’s pet toad croaked loudly
from under his hat. It was freezing on the tiny platform; rain was driving
down in icy sheets.
“Firs’ years this way!” called a familiar voice. Harry, Ron, and Hermione
turned and saw the gigantic outline of Hagrid at the other end of the platform,
beckoning the terrified-looking new students forward for their traditional
journey across the lake.
“All righ’, you three?” Hagrid yelled over the heads of the crowd. They
waved at him, but had no chance to speak to him because the mass of people
around them was shunting them away along the platform. Harry, Ron, and
Hermione followed the rest of the school along the platform and out onto a
rough mud track, where at least a hundred stagecoaches awaited the
remaining students, each pulled, Harry could only assume, by an invisible
horse, because 
It didn’t come . . . he kept on running . . . he opened his eyes.
A scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people.
A sign overhead said Hogwarts Express, eleven o’clock. Harry looked behind
him and saw a wrought-iron archway where the barrier had been, with the
words 
Platform Nine and Three-Quarters
 on it. He had done it.
Smoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd,while cats of every color wound here and there between their legs. Owls
hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and the
scraping of heavy trunks.
The first few carriages were already packed with students, some hanging
out of the window to talk to their families, some fighting over seats. Harry
pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seat. He passed a
round-faced boy who was saying, “Gran, I’ve lost my toad again.”
“Oh, 
Neville,
” he heard the old woman sigh.
A boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd.
“Give us a look, Lee, go on.”
The boy il. Harry couldn’t help laughing.
Sirius had been trapped inside for a very long time. Mrs. Weasley pursed her
lips in an almost Aunt Petunia-ish way.
It took them twenty minutes to reach King’s Cross by foot and nothing
more eventful happened during that time than Sirius scaring a couple of cats
for Harry’s entertainment. Once inside the station they lingered casually
beside the barrier between platforms nine and ten until the coast was clear,
then each of them leaned against it in turn and fell easily through onto
platform nine and three quarters, where the Hogwarts Express stood belching
sooty steam over a platform packed with departing students and their families.Harry inhaled the familiar smell and felt his spirits soar. . . . He was really
going back. . . .
“I hope the others make it in time,” said Mrs. Weasley anxiously, staring
behind her at the wrought-iron arch spanning the platform, through which
new arrivals would come.
“Nice dog, Harry!” called a tall boy with dreadlocks.
“Thanks, Lee,” said Harr up for his abysmal Potions
one. They had hoped that Goyle, who was almost as stupid as he was mean,
might be thrown out, but he had passed, too. It was a shame, but as Ron said,
you couldn’t have everything in life.
And suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their trunks were packed,
Neville’s toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets; notes were handed
out to all students, warning them not to use magic over the holidays (“I
always hope they’ll forget to give us these,” said Fred Weasley sadly); Hagrid
was there to take them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across the lake;
they were boarding the Hogwarts Express; talking and laughing as the
countryside became greener and tidier; eating Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor
Beans as they sped past Muggle towns; pulling off their wizard robes and
putting on jackets and coats; pulling into platform nine and three-quarters at
King’s Cross station.
It took quite a while for them all to get off the platform. A wizened old
guard was up by the ticket barrier, lett jeans because he didn’t want
to walk into the station in his wizard’s robes — he’d change on the train. He
checked his Hogwarts list yet again to make sure he had everything he
needed, saw that Hedwig was shut safely in her cage, and then paced the
room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up. Two hours later, Harry’s huge, heavy
trunk had been loaded into the Dursleys’ car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley
into sitting next to Harry, and they had set off.
They reached King’s Cross at half past ten. Uncle Vernon dumped Harry’s
trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him. Harry thought this
was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, facing the platforms
with a nasty grin on his face.
“Well, there you are, boy. Platform nine — platform ten. Your platform
should be somewhere in the middle, but they don’t seem to have built it yet,
do they?”
He was quite right, of course. There was a big plastic number nine over one
platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it, and in the
middle,"
What is the name of Harry's godfather?,Sirius Black,Harry's godfather is Sirius Black.," mine.”
Harry read and reread the letter from Sirius all the way back into King’s
Cross station. It was still clutched tightly in his hand as he, Ron, and
Hermione stepped back through the barrier of platform nine and three-
quarters. Harry spotted Uncle Vernon at once. He was standing a good
distance from Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, eyeing them suspiciously, and when
Mrs. Weasley hugged Harry in greeting, his worst suspicions about them
seemed confirmed.
“I’ll call about the World Cup!” Ron yelled after Harry as Harry bid him
and Hermione good-bye, then wheeled the trolley bearing his trunk and
Hedwig’s cage toward Uncle Vernon, who greeted him in his usual fashion.
“What’s that?” he snarled, staring at the envelope Harry was still clutching
in his hand. “If it’s another form for me to sign, you’ve got another —”
“It’s not,” said Harry cheerfully. “It’s a letter from my godfather.”
“Godfather?” spluttered Uncle Vernon. “You haven’t got a godfather!”
“Yes, I have,” said Harry brightly. “He was my mum and dad’s best  Harry bid him
and Hermione good-bye, then wheeled the trolley bearing his trunk and
Hedwig’s cage toward Uncle Vernon, who greeted him in his usual fashion.
“What’s that?” he snarled, staring at the envelope Harry was still clutching
in his hand. “If it’s another form for me to sign, you’ve got another —”
“It’s not,” said Harry cheerfully. “It’s a letter from my godfather.”
“Godfather?” spluttered Uncle Vernon. “You haven’t got a godfather!”
“Yes, I have,” said Harry brightly. “He was my mum and dad’s best friend.
He’s a convicted murderer, but he’s broken out of Wizard prison and he’s on
the run. He likes to keep in touch with me, though . . . keep up with my
news . . . check if I’m happy. . . .”
And, grinning broadly at the look of horror on Uncle Vernon’s face, Harry
set off toward the station exit, Hedwig rattling along in front of him, for what
looked like a much better summer than the last.

I AM LORD VOLDEMORT
“You see?” he whispered. “It was a name I was already using at Hogwarts,
to my most intimate friends only, of course. You think I was going to use my
filthy Muggle father’s name forever? I, in whose veins runs the blood of
Salazar Slytherin himself, through my mother’s side? I, keep the name of a
foul, common Muggle, who abandoned me even before I was born, just
because he found out his wife was a witch? No, Harry — I fashioned myself a
new name, a name I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak,when I had become the greatest sorcerer in the world!”
Harry’s brain seemed to have jammed. He stared numbly at Riddle, at the
orphaned boy who had grown up to murder Harry’s own parents, and so many
others. . . . At last he forced himself to speak.
“You’re not,” he said, his quiet voice full of hatred.
“Not what?” snapped Riddle.
“Not the greatest sorcerer in the world,” said Harry, breathing fast. “Sorry
to disappoint you and all that, but the grea for me. I used your
name but told them to take the gold from Gringotts vault number seven
hundred and eleven — my own. Please consider it as thirteen birthdays’
worth of presents from your godfather.
I would also like to apologize for the fright I think I gave you that
night last year when you left your uncle’s house. I had only hoped to get
a glimpse of you before starting my journey north, but I think the sight of
me alarmed you.
I am enclosing something else for you, which I think will make your
next year at Hogwarts more enjoyable.
If ever you need me, send word. Your owl will find me.
I’ll write again soon.
Sirius
Harry looked eagerly inside the envelope. There was another piece of
parchment in there. He read it through quickly and felt suddenly as warm and
contented as though he’d swallowed a bottle of hot butterbeer in one gulp.
I, Sirius Black, Harry Potter’s godfather, hereby give him permission to
visit Hogsmeade on weekends.
“That’ll be good enough for Dumbledore!” said Harry happily. He looked
bac s so raw and fresh inside, he could not
muster any great sense of fear. It was sunny and the grounds around him were
full of laughing people, and even though he felt as distant from them as
though he belonged to a different race, it was still very hard to believe as he
sat here that his life must include, or end in, murder. . . .
He sat there for a long time, gazing out at the water, trying not to think
about his godfather or to remember that it was directly across from here, on
the opposite bank, that Sirius had collapsed trying to fend off a hundred
dementors. . . .
The sun had fallen before he realized that he was cold. He got up and
returned to the castle, wiping his face on his sleeve as he went.
Ron and Hermione left the hospital wing completely cured three days before
the end of term. Hermione showed signs of wanting to talk about Sirius, but
Ron tended to make hushing noises every time she mentioned his name.
Harry was not sure whether or not he wanted to talk about his godfather yet;
his wishes varie  he owned.”
Over on the sofa, Uncle Vernon’s head turned, but Harry did not look at
him, nor could he think of anything to say except, “Oh. Right.”
“This is, in the main, fairly straightforward,” Dumbledore went on. “You
add a reasonable amount of gold to your account at Gringotts, and you inherit
all of Sirius’s personal possessions. The slightly problematic part of the
legacy —”
“His godfather’s dead?” said Uncle Vernon loudly from the sofa.
Dumbledore and Harry both turned to look at him. The glass of mead was
now knocking quite insistently on the side of Vernon’s head; he attempted to
beat it away. “He’s dead? His godfather?”
“Yes,” said Dumbledore. He did not ask Harry why he had not confided in
the Dursleys. “Our problem,” he continued to Harry, as if there had been no
interruption, “is that Sirius also left you number twelve, Grimmauld Place.”
“He’s been left a house?” said Uncle Vernon greedily, his small eyes
narrowing, but nobody answered him.
“You can keep using it as headquarters,” said Harry. “I  zard
of all time? How did 
you
 escape with nothing but a scar, while Lord
Voldemort’s powers were destroyed?”
There was an odd red gleam in his hungry eyes now.
“Why do you care how I escaped?” said Harry slowly. “Voldemort was
after your time. . . .”
“Voldemort,” said Riddle softly, “is my past, present, and future, Harry
Potter. . . .”
He pulled Harry’s wand from his pocket and began to trace it through the
air, writing three shimmering words:
TOM MARVOLO RIDDLE
Then he waved the wand once, and the letters of his name rearranged
themselves:
I AM LORD VOLDEMORT
“You see?” he whispered. “It was a name I was already using at Hogwarts,
to my most intimate friends only, of course. You think I was going to use my
filthy Muggle father’s name forever? I, in whose veins runs the blood of
Salazar Slytherin himself, through my mother’s side? I, keep the name of a

a cracked and worn-out Sneakoscope, and a gold locket inside which a note
signed R.A.B. had been hidden, he finally discovered the sharp edge that had
done the damage. He recognized it at once. It was a two-inch-long fragment
of the enchanted mirror that his dead godfather, Sirius, had given him. Harry
laid it aside and felt cautiously around the trunk for the rest, but nothing more
remained of his godfather’s last gift except powdered glass, which clung to
the deepest layer of debris like glittering grit.
Harry sat up and examined the jagged piece on which he had cut himself,
seeing nothing but his own bright green eye reflected back at him. Then he
placed the fragment on top of that morning’s 
Daily Prophet, 
which lay unread
on the bed, and attempted to stem the sudden upsurge of bitter memories, the
stabs of regret and of longing the discovery of the broken mirror had
occasioned, by attacking the rest of the rubbish "
Who is the gamekeeper at Hogwarts?,Rubeus Hagrid,The gamekeeper at Hogwarts is Rubeus Hagrid.,"hose friends of Harry Potter’s who are
suffering for their allegiance?” Lee was saying.
“Well, as regular listeners will know, several of the more outspoken
supporters of Harry Potter have now been imprisoned, including Xenophilius
Lovegood, erstwhile editor of 
The Quibbler
,” said Lupin.
“At least he’s still alive!” muttered Ron.
“We have also heard within the last few hours that Rubeus Hagrid” — all
three of them gasped, and so nearly missed the rest of the sentence — “well-
known gamekeeper at Hogwarts School, has narrowly escaped arrest within
the grounds of Hogwarts, where he is rumored to have hosted a ‘Support
Harry Potter’ party in his house. However, Hagrid was not taken into custody,
and is, we believe, on the run.”
“I suppose it helps, when escaping from Death Eaters, if you’ve got a
sixteen-foot-high half brother?” asked Lee.
“It would tend to give you an edge,” agreed Lupin gravely. “May I just add
that while we here at

even the most devoted o h-Finish Handle Polish, a pair of
gleaming silver Tail-Twig Clippers, a tiny brass compass to clip on yourbroom for long journeys, and a 
Handbook of Do-It-Yourself Broomcare.
Apart from his friends, the thing that Harry missed most about Hogwarts
was Quidditch, the most popular sport in the magical world — highly
dangerous, very exciting, and played on broomsticks. Harry happened to be a
very good Quidditch player; he had been the youngest person in a century to
be picked for one of the Hogwarts House teams. One of Harry’s most prized
possessions was his Nimbus Two Thousand racing broom.
Harry put the leather case aside and picked up his last parcel. He
recognized the untidy scrawl on the brown paper at once: This was from
Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper. He tore off the top layer of paper and
glimpsed something green and leathery, but before he could unwrap it
properly, the parcel gave a strange quiver, and whatever was inside it snapped
loudly — as though it had jaws.
Harry froze. He knew that Hagrid would w. Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two
large ice creams to show he couldn’t come in.
“That’s Hagrid,” said Harry, pleased to know something the boy didn’t.
“He works at Hogwarts.”
“Oh,” said the boy, “I’ve heard of him. He’s a sort of servant, isn’t he?”
“He’s the gamekeeper,” said Harry. He was liking the boy less and less
every second.
“Yes, exactly. I heard he’s a sort of 
savage
 — lives in a hut on the school
grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up
setting fire to his bed.”
“I think he’s brilliant,” said Harry coldly.
“
Do
 you?” said the boy, with a slight sneer. “Why is he with you? Where
are your parents?”
“They’re dead,” said Harry shortly. He didn’t feel much like going into the
matter with this boy.
“Oh, sorry,” said the other, not sounding sorry at all. “But they were 
ourkind, weren’t they?”
“They were a witch and wizard, if that’s what you mean.”
“I really don’t think they should let the other sort in, do you? They’re just
not the fact, he was as not normal as
it is possible to be.
Harry Potter was a wizard — a wizard fresh from his first year at HogwartsSchool of Witchcraft and Wizardry. And if the Dursleys were unhappy to
have him back for the holidays, it was nothing to how Harry felt.
He missed Hogwarts so much it was like having a constant stomachache.
He missed the castle, with its secret passageways and ghosts, his classes
(though perhaps not Snape, the Potions master), the mail arriving by owl,
eating banquets in the Great Hall, sleeping in his four-poster bed in the tower
dormitory, visiting the gamekeeper, Hagrid, in his cabin next to the Forbidden
Forest in the grounds, and, especially, Quidditch, the most popular sport in the
Wizarding world (six tall goalposts, four flying balls, and fourteen players on
broomsticks).
All Harry’s spellbooks, his wand, robes, cauldron, and top-of-the-line
Nimbus Two Thousand broomstick had been locked in a cupboard under the
stairs by Uncle Vernon the instant Harry had come home. What did th unfolded it, and read it, with Ron,
Seamus, Dean, and Neville looking over his shoulder. It was an article topped
with a picture of Hagrid looking extremely shifty.
DUMBLEDORE’S GIANT MISTAKE
Albus Dumbledore, eccentric headmaster of Hogwarts School of
Witchcraft and Wizardry, has never been afraid to make
controversial staff appointments, 
writes Rita Skeeter, Special
Correspondent.
 In September of this year, he hired Alastor “Mad-
Eye” Moody, the notoriously jinx-happy ex-Auror, to teach Defense
Against the Dark Arts, a decision that caused many raised eyebrows
at the Ministry of Magic, given Moody’s well-known habit of
attacking anybody who makes a sudden movement in his presence.
Mad-Eye Moody, however, looks responsible and kindly when set
beside the part-human Dumbledore employs to teach Care ofMagical Creatures.
Rubeus Hagrid, who admits to being expelled from Hogwarts in
his third year, has enjoyed the position of gamekeeper at the school
ever since, a job secured for him by Dumbledore. Last year,
ho Malfoy’s cold drawl from
behind them. “Are you trying to earn some extra money, Weasley? Hoping to
be gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts, I suppose — that hut of
Hagrid’s must seem like a palace compared to what your family’s used to.”
Ron dived at Malfoy just as Snape came up the stairs.
“WEASLEY!”
Ron let go of the front of Malfoy’s robes.
“He was provoked, Professor Snape,” said Hagrid, sticking his huge hairy
face out from behind the tree. “Malfoy was insultin’ his family.”
“Be that as it may, fighting is against Hogwarts rules, Hagrid,” said Snape
silkily. “Five points from Gryffindor, Weasley, and be grateful it isn’t more.
Move along, all of you.”
Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle pushed roughly past the tree, scattering needles
everywhere and smirking.“I’ll get him,” said Ron, grinding his teeth at Malfoy’s back, “one of these
days, I’ll get him —”
“I hate them both,” said Harry, “Malfoy and Snape.”
“Come on, cheer up, it’s nearly Christmas,” said Hagrid. “Tell yeh what,
come with me an’ see the Grea  have I? Here . . .”
Hagrid got up, went over to his dresser, opened a drawer, and pulled out a
picture of a short wizard with Hagrid’s crinkled black eyes, beaming as he sat
on top of Hagrid’s shoulder. Hagrid was a good seven or eight feet tall,
judging by the apple tree beside him, but his face was beardless, young,
round, and smooth — he looked hardly older than eleven.
“Tha’ was taken jus’ after I got inter Hogwarts,” Hagrid croaked. “Dad was
dead chuffed . . . thought I migh’ not be a wizard, see, ’cos me mum . . . well,
anyway. ’Course, I never was great shakes at magic, really . . . but at least he
never saw me expelled. Died, see, in me second year. . . .
“Dumbledore was the one who stuck up for me after Dad went. Got me the
gamekeeper job . . . trusts people, he does. Gives ’em second chances . . .
tha’s what sets him apar’ from other Heads, see. He’ll accept anyone at
Hogwarts, s’long as they’ve got the talent. Knows people can turn out okay
even if their families weren’ . . . well . . . all tha’ r ather says it’s a crime if I’m not picked to play for my House,
and I must say, I agree. Know what House you’ll be in yet?”
“No,” said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute.
“Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know I’ll be
in Slytherin, all our family have been — imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think
I’d leave, wouldn’t you?”
“Mmm,” said Harry, wishing he could say something a bit more interesting.
“I say, look at that man!” said the boy suddenly, nodding toward the front
window. Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two
large ice creams to show he couldn’t come in.
“That’s Hagrid,” said Harry, pleased to know something the boy didn’t.
“He works at Hogwarts.”
“Oh,” said the boy, “I’ve heard of him. He’s a sort of servant, isn’t he?”
“He’s the gamekeeper,” said Harry. He was liking the boy less and less
every second.
“Yes, exactly. I heard he’s a sort of 
savage
 — lives in a hut on the school
grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic, "
What position does Harry play on his Quidditch team?,Seeker,"According to the provided context, Harry plays Seeker on his Quidditch team.","irius is . . . he could be in Africa or
somewhere, couldn’t he?” said Hermione reasonably. “Hedwig’s not going to
manage 
that
 journey in a few days.”
“Yeah, I know,” said Harry, but there was a leaden feeling in his stomach as
he looked out of the window at the Hedwig-free sky.
“Come and have a game of Quidditch in the orchard, Harry,” said Ron.
“Come on — three on three, Bill and Charlie and Fred and George will
play. . . . You can try out the Wronski Feint. . . .”
“Ron,” said Hermione, in an I-don’t-think-you’re-being-very-sensitive sortof voice, “Harry doesn’t want to play Quidditch right now. . . . He’s worried,
and he’s tired. . . . We all need to go to bed. . . .”
“Yeah, I want to play Quidditch,” said Harry suddenly. “Hang on, I’ll get
my Firebolt.”
Hermione left the room, muttering something that sounded very much like
“Boys.”
Neither Mr. Weasley nor Percy was at home much over the following week.
Both left the house each morning before the rest of the family got up, and
returned well after dinner e , but he had another reason for not
wanting Snape near him while he was playing Quidditch. . . .
The rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of
practice, but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common room,
where he found Ron and Hermione playing chess. Chess was the only thing
Hermione ever lost at, something Harry and Ron thought was very good for
her.
“Don’t talk to me for a moment,” said Ron when Harry sat down next to
him, “I need to concen —” He caught sight of Harry’s face. “What’s the
matter with you? You look terrible.”
Speaking quietly so that no one else would hear, Harry told the other two
about Snape’s sudden, sinister desire to be a Quidditch referee.
“Don’t play,” said Hermione at once.“Say you’re ill,” said Ron.
“Pretend to break your leg,” Hermione suggested.
“
Really
 break your leg,” said Ron.
“I can’t,” said Harry. “There isn’t a reserve Seeker. If I back out, Gryffindor
can’t play at all.”
At that moment Neville toppled into the common room. How he h f the pitch it was to a storm of catcalls
and jeers from the Slytherin Quidditch team and assorted hangers-on, who
were grouped halfway up the empty stands and whose voices echoed loudly
around the stadium.
“What’s that Weasley’s riding?” Malfoy called in his sneering drawl. “Why
would anyone put a Flying Charm on a moldy old log like that?”
Crabbe, Goyle, and Pansy Parkinson guffawed and shrieked with laughter.
Ron mounted his broom and kicked off from the ground and Harry followed
him, watching his ears turn red from behind.
“Ignore them,” he said, accelerating to catch up with Ron. “We’ll see who’s
laughing after we play them . . .”
“Exactly the attitude I want, Harry,” said Angelina approvingly, soaring
around them with the Quaffle under her arm and slowing to hover on the spot
in front of her airborne team. “Okay everyone, we’re going to start with some
passes just to warm up, the whole team please —”
“Hey, Johnson, what’s with that hairstyle anyway?” shrieked Pansy
Parkinson from below. “Why would anyon  door buying my books and Mother’s up the street
looking at wands,” said the boy. He had a bored, drawling voice. “Then I’m
going to drag them off to look at racing brooms. I don’t see why first years
can’t have their own. I think I’ll bully Father into getting me one and I’ll
smuggle it in somehow.”
Harry was strongly reminded of Dudley.“Have 
you
 got your own broom?” the boy went on.
“No,” said Harry.
“Play Quidditch at all?”
“No,” Harry said again, wondering what on earth Quidditch could be.
“
I
 do — Father says it’s a crime if I’m not picked to play for my House,
and I must say, I agree. Know what House you’ll be in yet?”
“No,” said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute.
“Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know I’ll be
in Slytherin, all our family have been — imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think
I’d leave, wouldn’t you?”
“Mmm,” said Harry, wishing he could say something a bit more interesting.
“I say, look at that man!” said the boy suddenly, nodding toward the front
windo .” Professor McGonagall stood up and stared out of the windowat the Quidditch field, just visible through the rain. “Well . . . goodness
knows, I’d like to see us win the Cup at last . . . but all the same, Potter . . . I’d
be happier if a teacher were present. I’ll ask Madam Hooch to oversee your
training sessions.”
The weather worsened steadily as the first Quidditch match drew nearer.
Undaunted, the Gryffindor team was training harder than ever under the eye
of Madam Hooch. Then, at their final training session before Saturday’s
match, Oliver Wood gave his team some unwelcome news.
“We’re not playing Slytherin!” he told them, looking very angry. “Flint’s
just been to see me. We’re playing Hufflepuff instead.”
“Why?” chorused the rest of the team.
“Flint’s excuse is that their Seeker’s arm’s still injured,” said Wood,
grinding his teeth furiously. “But it’s obvious why they’re doing it. Don’t
want to play in this weather. Think it’ll damage their chances. . . .”
There had been strong winds and heavy rain al you’ll understand
why I don’t think it’s a good idea for you to be practicing Quidditch in the
evenings. Out on the field with only your team members, it’s very exposed,
Potter —”
“We’ve got our first match on Saturday!” said Harry, outraged. “I’ve got to
train, Professor!”
Professor McGonagall considered him intently. Harry knew she was deeply
interested in the Gryffindor team’s prospects; it had been she, after all, who’d
suggested him as Seeker in the first place. He waited, holding his breath.
“Hmm . . .” Professor McGonagall stood up and stared out of the windowat the Quidditch field, just visible through the rain. “Well . . . goodness
knows, I’d like to see us win the Cup at last . . . but all the same, Potter . . . I’d
be happier if a teacher were present. I’ll ask Madam Hooch to oversee your
training sessions.”
The weather worsened steadily as the first Quidditch match drew nearer.
Undaunted, the Gryffindor team was training harder than ever under the eye
of Madam Hooch. Then, at their final training  king for
any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor!”
George Weasley really did fall off his broom at these words.
“
Snape’s
 refereeing?” he spluttered through a mouthful of mud. “When’s he
ever refereed a Quidditch match? He’s not going to be fair if we might
overtake Slytherin.”
The rest of the team landed next to George to complain, too.
“It’s not 
my
 fault,” said Wood. “We’ve just got to make sure we play a
clean game, so Snape hasn’t got an excuse to pick on us.”
Which was all very well, thought Harry, but he had another reason for not
wanting Snape near him while he was playing Quidditch. . . .
The rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of
practice, but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common room,
where he found Ron and Hermione playing chess. Chess was the only thing
Hermione ever lost at, something Harry and Ron thought was very good for
her.
“Don’t talk to me for a moment,” said Ron when Harry sat down next to
him, “I need to concen —” He caught sight of H  coast was clear for them
to leave the bathroom, Ron muttered to Harry, “It’ll be a lot less hassle if you
can just knock Malfoy off his broom tomorrow.”
Harry woke early on Saturday morning and lay for a while thinking about the
coming Quidditch match. He was nervous, mainly at the thought of what
Wood would say if Gryffindor lost, but also at the idea of facing a team
mounted on the fastest racing brooms gold could buy. He had never wanted to
beat Slytherin so badly. After half an hour of lying there with his insides
churning, he got up, dressed, and went down to breakfast early, where he
found the rest of the Gryffindor team huddled at the long, empty table, all
looking uptight and not speaking much.
As eleven o’clock approached, the whole school started to make its way
down to the Quidditch stadium. It was a muggy sort of day with a hint of
thunder in the air. Ron and Hermione came hurrying over to wish Harry good
luck as he entered the locker rooms. The team pulled on their scarlet
Gryffindor robes, then"
Who is the ghost of Gryffindor House?,Nearly Headless Nick,"The ghost of Gryffindor House is Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, also known as Nearly Headless Nick.","ching the
bottom of the stairs, where Nearly Headless Nick, ghost of Gryffindor Tower,
stood waiting for him.
“Harry! My dear boy!”Nick made to grasp Harry’s hands with both of his own: Harry’s felt as
though they had been thrust into icy water.
“Nick, you’ve got to help me. Who’s the ghost of Ravenclaw Tower?”
Nearly Headless Nick looked surprised and a little offended.
“The Gray Lady, of course; but if it is ghostly services you require — ?”
“It’s got to be her — d’you know where she is?”
“Let’s see. . . .”
Nick’s head wobbled a little on his ruff as he turned hither and thither,
peering over the heads of the swarming students.
“That’s her over there, Harry, the young woman with the long hair.”
Harry looked in the direction of Nick’s transparent, pointing finger and saw
a tall ghost who caught sight of Harry looking at her, raised her eyebrows, and
drifted away through a solid wall.
Harry ran after her. Once through the door of the corridor into which she
had disappeared, he saw her at the very end of the p tarved Harry, but he’d never been allowed
to eat as much as he liked. Dudley had always taken anything that Harry
really wanted, even if it made him sick. Harry piled his plate with a bit of
everything except the peppermints and began to eat. It was all delicious.
“That does look good,” said the ghost in the ruff sadly, watching Harry cut
up his steak.
“Can’t you — ?”
“I haven’t eaten for nearly five hundred years,” said the ghost. “I don’t
need to, of course, but one does miss it. I don’t think I’ve introduced myself?
Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington at your service. Resident ghost of
Gryffindor Tower.”
“I know who you are!” said Ron suddenly. “My brothers told me about you
— you’re Nearly Headless Nick!”
“I would 
prefer
 you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy —” the ghost began
stiffly, but sandy-haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted.
“
Nearly
 Headless? How can you be 
nearly
 headless?”
Sir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little chat wasn’t going at
all the way he wanted.
“Like 
this,
” he said   you are here, your House will be something like
your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your
House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free time in your House
common room.
“The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and
Slytherin. Each House has its own noble history and each has produced
outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs
will earn your House points, while any rule-breaking will lose House points.
At the end of the year, the House with the most points is awarded the House
Cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever House
becomes yours.
“The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest
of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can
while you are waiting.”
Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville’s cloak, which was fastened
under his left ear, and on Ron’s smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to
flatten his hair.
“I shall return when we are r .”
Nick’s head wobbled a little on his ruff as he turned hither and thither,
peering over the heads of the swarming students.
“That’s her over there, Harry, the young woman with the long hair.”
Harry looked in the direction of Nick’s transparent, pointing finger and saw
a tall ghost who caught sight of Harry looking at her, raised her eyebrows, and
drifted away through a solid wall.
Harry ran after her. Once through the door of the corridor into which she
had disappeared, he saw her at the very end of the passage, still gliding
smoothly away from him.
“Hey — wait — come back!”
She consented to pause, floating a few inches from the ground. Harry
supposed that she was beautiful, with her waist-length hair and floor-length
cloak, but she also looked haughty and proud. Close to, he recognized her as a
ghost he had passed several times in the corridor, but to whom he had never
spoken.
“You’re the Gray Lady?”
She nodded but did not speak.
“The ghost of Ravenclaw Tower?”
“That is correct.”
Her tone was not encouragi rin, eh?” said the small voice. “Are you sure? You could be
great, you know, it’s all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the
way to greatness, no doubt about that — no? Well, if you’re sure — better be
GRYFFINDOR!”
Harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall. He took off the
hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table. He was so relieved to
have been chosen and not put in Slytherin, he hardly noticed that he was
getting the loudest cheer yet. Percy the Prefect got up and shook his hand
vigorously, while the Weasley twins yelled, “We got Potter! We got Potter!”
Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff he’d seen earlier. The ghost
patted his arm, giving Harry the sudden, horrible feeling he’d just plunged it
into a bucket of ice-cold water.He could see the High Table properly now. At the end nearest him sat
Hagrid, who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up. Harry grinned back.
And there, in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair, sat Albus
Dumbledore. Ha bead of light right back into Voldemort’s wand . . . and slowly . . .
very slowly . . . it moved along the golden thread . . . it trembled for a
moment . . . and then it connected. . . .
At once, Voldemort’s wand began to emit echoing screams of pain . . . then
— Voldemort’s red eyes widened with shock — a dense, smoky hand flew out
of the tip of it and vanished . . . the ghost of the hand he had made
Wormtail . . . more shouts of pain . . . and then something much larger began
to blossom from Voldemort’s wand-tip, a great, grayish something, that
looked as though it were made of the solidest, densest smoke. . . . It was a
head . . . now a chest and arms . . . the torso of Cedric Diggory.
If ever Harry might have released his wand from shock, it would have been
then, but instinct kept him clutching his wand tightly, so that the thread of
golden light remained unbroken, even though the thick gray ghost of Cedric
Diggory (
was
 it a ghost? it looked so solid) emerged in its entirety from the
end of Voldemort’s   he looked like a radish with a bad sunburn.
“. . . for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years, I
award Gryffindor House fifty points.”
Gryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; the stars overhead
seemed to quiver. Percy could be heard telling the other prefects, “My
brother, you know! My youngest brother! Got past McGonagall’s giant chess
set!”
At last there was silence again.
“Second — to Miss Hermione Granger . . . for the use of cool logic in the
face of fire, I award Gryffindor House fifty points.”
Hermione buried her face in her arms; Harry strongly suspected she hadburst into tears. Gryffindors up and down the table were beside themselves —
they were a hundred points up.
“Third — to Mr. Harry Potter . . .” said Dumbledore. The room went
deadly quiet. “. . . for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor
House sixty points.”
The din was deafening. Those who could add up while yelling themselves
hoarse knew that Gryffindor now had four hundred and seventy-t shook his hand
vigorously, while the Weasley twins yelled, “We got Potter! We got Potter!”
Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff he’d seen earlier. The ghost
patted his arm, giving Harry the sudden, horrible feeling he’d just plunged it
into a bucket of ice-cold water.He could see the High Table properly now. At the end nearest him sat
Hagrid, who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up. Harry grinned back.
And there, in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair, sat Albus
Dumbledore. Harry recognized him at once from the card he’d gotten out of
the Chocolate Frog on the train. Dumbledore’s silver hair was the only thing
in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts. Harry spotted Professor
Quirrell, too, the nervous young man from the Leaky Cauldron. He was
looking very peculiar in a large purple turban.
And now there were only four people left to be sorted. “Thomas, Dean,” a
black boy even taller than Ron, joined Harry at the Gryffindor table. “Turpin,
Lisa,” became a Ravenclaw "
What magical creature pulls the carriages to Hogwarts?,Thestrals,The magical creatures that pull the carriages to Hogwarts are Thestrals.,", I wouldn’t fancy crossing the lake in this weather,” said Hermione
fervently, shivering as they inched slowly along the dark platform with the
rest of the crowd. A hundred horseless carriages stood waiting for them
outside the station. Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Neville climbed gratefully into
one of them, the door shut with a snap, and a few moments later, with a great
lurch, the long procession of carriages was rumbling and splashing its way up
the track toward Hogwarts Castle.T
 
CHAPTER  TWELVE
THE TRIWIZARD TOURNAMENT
hrough the gates, flanked with statues of winged boars, and up the
sweeping drive the carriages trundled, swaying dangerously in what
was fast becoming a gale. Leaning against the window, Harry could see
Hogwarts coming nearer, its many lighted windows blurred and shimmering
behind the thick curtain of rain. Lightning flashed across the sky as their
carriage came to a halt before the great oak front doors, which stood at the top
of a flight of stone steps. People who had occupied the carri flustered, and
following Krum through the crowd and out of sight.
“You’d better hurry up!” Ron called loudly after her. “The carriages’ll be
here in a minute!”
He let Harry keep a watch for the carriages, however, and spent the next
few minutes craning his neck over the crowd to try and see what Krum and
Hermione might be up to. They returned quite soon. Ron stared at Hermione,
but her face was quite impassive.
“I liked Diggory,” said Krum abruptly to Harry. “He vos alvays polite to
me. Alvays. Even though I vos from Durmstrang — with Karkaroff,” he
added, scowling.
“Have you got a new headmaster yet?” said Harry.Krum shrugged. He held out his hand as Fleur had done, shook Harry’s
hand, and then Ron’s. Ron looked as though he was suffering some sort of
painful internal struggle. Krum had already started walking away when Ron
burst out, “Can I have your autograph?”
Hermione turned away, smiling at the horseless carriages that were now
trundling toward them up the drive, as Krum, looking surprised but gratified  frightened. Harry could not see
why. The hall was quite empty but for themselves, the sobbing Bellatrix still
trapped under her statue, and the tiny baby Fawkes croaking feebly on the
floor —
And then Harry’s scar burst open. He knew he was dead: it was pain
beyond imagining, pain past endurance —
He was gone from the hall, he was locked in the coils of a creature with red
eyes, so tightly bound that Harry did not know where his body ended and the
creature’s began. They were fused together, bound by pain, and there was no
escape —
And when the creature spoke, it used Harry’s mouth, so that in his agony he
felt his jaw move. . . .
“Kill me now, Dumbledore . . .”
Blinded and dying, every part of him screaming for release, Harry felt the
creature use him again. . . .
“If death is nothing, Dumbledore, kill the boy . . .”Let the pain stop,
 thought Harry. 
Let him kill us. . . . End it,
Dumbledore. . . . Death is nothing compared to this. . . .
And I’ll see Sirius again. . . .
And as Harry’s heart filled with emo es
over Pigwidgeon as they left the train, heads bent and eyes narrowed against
the downpour. The rain was now coming down so thick and fast that it was as
though buckets of ice-cold water were being emptied repeatedly over their
heads.
“Hi, Hagrid!” Harry yelled, seeing a gigantic silhouette at the far end of the
platform.
“All righ’, Harry?” Hagrid bellowed back, waving. “See yeh at the feast if
we don’ drown!”
First years traditionally reached Hogwarts Castle by sailing across the lake
with Hagrid.
“Oooh, I wouldn’t fancy crossing the lake in this weather,” said Hermione
fervently, shivering as they inched slowly along the dark platform with the
rest of the crowd. A hundred horseless carriages stood waiting for them
outside the station. Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Neville climbed gratefully into
one of them, the door shut with a snap, and a few moments later, with a great
lurch, the long procession of carriages was rumbling and splashing its way up
the track toward Hogwarts Castle.T
 
CHAPTER  TWELVE
THE TRI  are those horse things?” Harry said, as he, Ron, and
Luna made for the carriage in which Hermione and Ginny were already
sitting.“What horse things?”
“The horse things pulling the carriages!” said Harry impatiently; they were,
after all, about three feet from the nearest one; it was watching them with
empty white eyes. Ron, however, gave Harry a perplexed look.
“What are you talking about?”
“I’m talking about — look!”
Harry grabbed Ron’s arm and wheeled him about so that he was face-to-
face with the winged horse. Ron stared straight at it for a second, then looked
back at Harry.
“What am I supposed to be looking at?”
“At the — there, between the shafts! Harnessed to the coach! It’s right
there in front —”
But as Ron continued to look bemused, a strange thought occurred to
Harry.
“Can’t . . . can’t you see them?”
“See 
what
?”
“Can’t you see what’s pulling the carriages?”
Ron looked seriously alarmed now.
“Are you feeling all right, Harry?”
“I . . . yeah . . .”
Harry felt utterly bewildered. The horse was th said Harry, Ron, and Ginny angrily.
Harry glared at Hermione; she cleared her throat and quickly said,
“Erm . . . yes . . . he’s very good.”
“Well, we think he’s a bit of a joke in Ravenclaw,” said Luna, unfazed.
“You’ve got a rubbish sense of humor then,” Ron snapped, as the wheels
below them creaked into motion.Luna did not seem perturbed by Ron’s rudeness; on the contrary, she
simply watched him for a while as though he were a mildly interesting
television program.
Rattling and swaying, the carriages moved in convoy up the road. When
they passed between the tall stone pillars topped with winged boars on either
side of the gates to the school grounds, Harry leaned forward to try and see
whether there were any lights on in Hagrid’s cabin by the Forbidden Forest,
but the grounds were in complete darkness. Hogwarts Castle, however,
loomed ever closer: a towering mass of turrets, jet-black against the dark sky,
here and there a window blazing fiery bright above them.
The carriages jingled to a halt near the sto WIZARD TOURNAMENT
hrough the gates, flanked with statues of winged boars, and up the
sweeping drive the carriages trundled, swaying dangerously in what
was fast becoming a gale. Leaning against the window, Harry could see
Hogwarts coming nearer, its many lighted windows blurred and shimmering
behind the thick curtain of rain. Lightning flashed across the sky as their
carriage came to a halt before the great oak front doors, which stood at the top
of a flight of stone steps. People who had occupied the carriages in front were
already hurrying up the stone steps into the castle. Harry, Ron, Hermione, and
Neville jumped down from their carriage and dashed up the steps too, looking
up only when they were safely inside the cavernous, torch-lit entrance hall,
with its magnificent marble staircase.
“Blimey,” said Ron, shaking his head and sending water everywhere, “if
that keeps up the lake’s going to overflow. I’m soak — ARRGH!”
A large, red, water-filled balloon had dropped from out of the ceiling onto
Ron’s head  . The little
creature on the bed had large, bat-like ears and bulging green eyes the
size of tennis balls. Harry knew instantly that this was what had been
watching him out of the garden hedge that morning.
As they stared at each other, Harry heard Dudley’s voice from the hall.
“May I take your coats, Mr. and Mrs. Mason?”
The creature slipped off the bed and bowed so low that the end of its long,
thin nose touched the carpet. Harry noticed that it was wearing what looked
like an old pillowcase, with rips for arm- and leg-holes.
“Er — hello,” said Harry nervously.
“Harry Potter!” said the creature in a high-pitched voice Harry was sure
would carry down the stairs. “So long has Dobby wanted to meet you, sir . . .
Such an honor it is. . . .”
“Th-thank you,” said Harry, edging along the wall and sinking into his desk
chair, next to Hedwig, who was asleep in her large cage. He wanted to ask,
“What are you?” but thought it would sound too rude, so instead he said,“Who are you?”
“Dobby, sir. Just Dobby. Dobby the ho"
What is the name of the house elf who serves the Malfoy family?,Dobby,The name of the house-elf who serves the Malfoy family is Dobby.," Malfoy made Dudley Dursley look like a kind,
thoughtful, and sensitive boy.
“I don’t know whether the Malfoys own a house-elf. . . .” said Harry.
“Well, whoever owns him will be an old Wizarding family, and they’ll be
rich,” said Fred.
“Yeah, Mum’s always wishing we had a house-elf to do the ironing,” said
George. “But all we’ve got is a lousy old ghoul in the attic and gnomes all
over the garden. House-elves come with big old manors and castles and
places like that; you wouldn’t catch one in our house. . . .”Harry was silent. Judging by the fact that Draco Malfoy usually had the
best of everything, his family was rolling in wizard gold; he could just see
Malfoy strutting around a large manor house. Sending the family servant to
stop Harry from going back to Hogwarts also sounded exactly like the sort of
thing Malfoy would do. Had Harry been stupid to take Dobby seriously?
“I’m glad we came to get you, anyway,” said Ron. “I was getting really
worried when you didn’t answer any of my letters. I thought it was e, turning around. “Not Lucius Malfoy’s son?”
“Must be, it’s not a very common name, is it?” said Harry. “Why?”
“I’ve heard Dad talking about him,” said George. “He was a big supporter
of You-Know-Who.”
“And when You-Know-Who disappeared,” said Fred, craning around to
look at Harry, “Lucius Malfoy came back saying he’d never meant any of it.
Load of dung — Dad reckons he was right in You-Know-Who’s inner circle.”
Harry had heard these rumors about Malfoy’s family before, and they
didn’t surprise him at all. Malfoy made Dudley Dursley look like a kind,
thoughtful, and sensitive boy.
“I don’t know whether the Malfoys own a house-elf. . . .” said Harry.
“Well, whoever owns him will be an old Wizarding family, and they’ll be

screech and was beating her wings wildly against the bars of her cage.“Dobby had to punish himself, sir,” said the elf, who had gone slightly
cross-eyed. “Dobby almost spoke ill of his family, sir. . . .”
“Your family?”
“The wizard family Dobby serves, sir. . . . Dobby is a house-elf — bound to
serve one house and one family forever. . . .”
“Do they know you’re here?” asked Harry curiously.
Dobby shuddered.
“Oh, no, sir, no . . . Dobby will have to punish himself most grievously for
coming to see you, sir. Dobby will have to shut his ears in the oven door for
this. If they ever knew, sir —”
“But won’t they notice if you shut your ears in the oven door?”
“Dobby doubts it, sir. Dobby is always having to punish himself for
something, sir. They lets Dobby get on with it, sir. Sometimes they reminds
me to do extra punishments. . . .”
“But why don’t you leave? Escape?”
“A house-elf must be set free, sir. And the family will never set Dobby
free . . . Dobby will serve the family until sat hiccoughing, looking like a large and
very ugly doll. At last he managed to control himself, and sat with his great
eyes fixed on Harry in an expression of watery adoration.
“You can’t have met many decent wizards,” said Harry, trying to cheer him
up.
Dobby shook his head. Then, without warning, he leapt up and started
banging his head furiously on the window, shouting, “
Bad
 Dobby! 
Bad
Dobby!”
“Don’t — what are you doing?” Harry hissed, springing up and pulling
Dobby back onto the bed — Hedwig had woken up with a particularly loud
screech and was beating her wings wildly against the bars of her cage.“Dobby had to punish himself, sir,” said the elf, who had gone slightly
cross-eyed. “Dobby almost spoke ill of his family, sir. . . .”
“Your family?”
“The wizard family Dobby serves, sir. . . . Dobby is a house-elf — bound to
serve one house and one family forever. . . .”
“Do they know you’re here?” asked Harry curiously.
Dobby shuddered.
“Oh, no, sir, no . . . Dobby will have to punish himself most grievou t bay.
“What about her? Dobby — she hasn’t found out about this — about us —
about the D.A.?”He read the answer in the elf’s stricken face. His hands held fast by Harry,
the elf tried to kick himself and sank to his knees.
“Is she coming?” Harry asked quietly.
Dobby let out a howl. “Yes, Harry Potter, yes!”
Harry straightened up and looked around at the motionless, terrified people
gazing at the thrashing elf.
“WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?” Harry bellowed. “RUN!”
They all pelted toward the exit at once, forming a scrum at the door, then
people burst through; Harry could hear them sprinting along the corridors and
hoped they had the sense not to try and make it all the way to their
dormitories. It was only ten to nine, if they just took refuge in the library or
the Owlery, which were both nearer —
“Harry, come on!” shrieked Hermione from the center of the knot of people
now fighting to get out.
He scooped up Dobby, who was still attempting to do himself serious
injury, and ran with the elf in his arms to join the re oddly familiar. . . .
“Dobby?”
 said Harry incredulously.
The tiny creature looked up and stretched its fingers, revealing enormous
brown eyes and a nose the exact size and shape of a large tomato. It wasn’t
Dobby — it was, however, unmistakably a house-elf, as Harry’s friend Dobby
had been. Harry had set Dobby free from his old owners, the Malfoy family.
“Did sir just call me Dobby?” squeaked the elf curiously from between its
fingers. Its voice was higher even than Dobby’s had been, a teeny, quivering
squeak of a voice, and Harry suspected — though it was very hard to tell with
a house-elf — that this one might just be female. Ron and Hermione spunaround in their seats to look. Though they had heard a lot about Dobby from
Harry, they had never actually met him. Even Mr. Weasley looked around in
interest.
“Sorry,” Harry told the elf, “I just thought you were someone I knew.”
“But I knows Dobby too, sir!” squeaked the elf. She was shielding her face,
as though blinded by light, though the Top Box was not b ng the summer. Evidently they had overheard the
conversation through the compartment door, which Dean and Seamus had left
ajar.
“Don’t remember asking you to join us, Malfoy,” said Harry coolly.
“Weasley . . . what is 
that
?” said Malfoy, pointing at Pigwidgeon’s cage. A
sleeve of Ron’s dress robes was dangling from it, swaying with the motion of
the train, the moldy lace cuff very obvious.Ron made to stuff the robes out of sight, but Malfoy was too quick for him;
he seized the sleeve and pulled.
“Look at this!” said Malfoy in ecstasy, holding up Ron’s robes and showing
Crabbe and Goyle, “Weasley, you weren’t thinking of 
wearing
 these, were
you? I mean — they were very fashionable in about 1890. . . .”
“Eat dung, Malfoy!” said Ron, the same color as the dress robes as he
snatched them back out of Malfoy’s grip. Malfoy howled with derisive
laughter; Crabbe and Goyle guffawed stupidly.
“So . . . going to enter, Weasley? Going to try and bring a bit of glory to the
family name? There’s money involved as well, tant; yet it was almost empty but for a residue of old underwear,
sweets, empty ink bottles, and broken quills that coated the very bottom.
Nearby, on the floor, lay a purple leaflet emblazoned with the words:

Who is the Half-Blood Prince?,Severus Snape,"The Half-Blood Prince is the mysterious owner of a copy of ""Advanced Potion-Making"" that Harry, Ron, and Hermione are studying. The book contains additional notes and spells that the Half-Blood Prince has written, but the identity of the Half-Blood Prince remains unknown until the very end of the book.","h the picture
belonged; it was a rather dull story about interschool competitions.
“Her name was Eileen Prince. 
Prince,
 Harry.”
They looked at each other, and Harry realized what Hermione was trying to
say. He burst out laughing.
“No way.”
“What?”
“You think 
she
 was the Half-Blood . . . ? Oh, come on.”
“Well, why not? Harry, there aren’t any real princes in the Wizarding
world! It’s either a nickname, a made-up title somebody’s given themselves,
or it could be their actual name, couldn’t it? No, listen! If, say, her father wasa wizard whose surname was Prince, and her mother was a Muggle, then that
would make her a ‘half-blood Prince’!”
“Yeah, very ingenious, Hermione . . .”
“But it would! Maybe she was proud of being half a Prince!”
“Listen, Hermione, I can tell it’s not a girl. I can just tell.”
“The truth is that you don’t think a girl would have been clever enough,”
said Hermione angrily.
“How can I have hung round with you for five years and not think girls are
clever?” said Harry, stung by this. “It rmione, meanwhile, was resolutely plowing on
with what she called the “official” instructions, but becoming increasingly
bad-tempered as they yielded poorer results than the Prince’s.
Harry wondered vaguely who the Half-Blood Prince had been. Although
the amount of homework they had been given prevented him from reading the
whole of his copy of 
Advanced Potion-Making,
 he had skimmed through it
sufficiently to see that there was barely a page on which the Prince had not
made additional notes, not all of them concerned with potion-making. Here
and there were directions for what looked like spells that the Prince had made
up himself.
“Or herself,” said Hermione irritably, overhearing Harry pointing some of
these out to Ron in the common room on Saturday evening. “It might have
been a girl. I think the handwriting looks more like a girl’s than a boy’s.”“The Half-Blood 
Prince,
 he was called,” Harry said. “How many girls have
been Princes?”
Hermione seemed to have no answer to this. She merely scowled and
twitc rewolves deserve blood, that we ought to
revenge ourselves on normal people.”
“But you are normal!” said Harry fiercely. “You’ve just got a — a problem
—”
Lupin burst out laughing. “Sometimes you remind me a lot of James. He
called it my ‘furry little problem’ in company. Many people were under the
impression that I owned a badly behaved rabbit.”
He accepted a glass of eggnog from Mr. Weasley with a word of thanks,
looking slightly more cheerful. Harry, meanwhile, felt a rush of excitement:
This last mention of his father had reminded him that there was something he
had been looking forward to asking Lupin.
“Have you ever heard of someone called the Half-Blood Prince?”
“The Half-Blood what?”
“Prince,” said Harry, watching him closely for signs of recognition.
“There are no Wizarding princes,” said Lupin, now smiling. “Is this a title
you’re thinking of adopting? I should have thought being ‘the Chosen One’
would be enough.”
“It’s nothing to do with me!” said Harry indignantly. “The Half-Blood

said Hermione angrily.
“How can I have hung round with you for five years and not think girls are
clever?” said Harry, stung by this. “It’s the way he writes, I just know the
Prince was a bloke, I can tell. This girl hasn’t got anything to do with it.
Where did you get this anyway?”
“The library,” said Hermione predictably. “There’s a whole collection of
old 
Prophets
 up there. Well, I’m going to find out more about Eileen Prince if
I can.”
“Enjoy yourself,” said Harry irritably.
“I will,” said Hermione. “And the first place I’ll look,” she shot at him, as
she reached the portrait hole, “is records of old Potions awards!”
Harry scowled afte n of his father had reminded him that there was something he

“It’s nothing to do with me!” said Harry indignantly. “The Half-Blood
Prince is someone who used to go to Hogwarts, I’ve got his old Potions book.
He wrote spells all over it, spells he invented. One of them was Levicorpus
—”
“Oh, that one had a great vogue during my time at Hogwarts,” said Lupin
reminiscently. “There were a few months in my fifth year when you couldn’t
move for being hoisted into the air by your ankle.”
“My dad used it,” said Harry. “I saw him in the Pensieve, he used it on
Snape.”
He tried to sound casual, as though this was a throwaway comment of no
real importance, but h ns Harry continued to follow the
Half-Blood Prince’s instructions wherever they deviated from Libatius
Borage’s, with the result that by their fourth lesson Slughorn was raving about
Harry’s abilities, saying that he had rarely taught anyone so talented. Neither
Ron nor Hermione was delighted by this. Although Harry had offered to share
his book with both of them, Ron had more difficulty deciphering the
handwriting than Harry did, and could not keep asking Harry to read aloud or
it might look suspicious. Hermione, meanwhile, was resolutely plowing on
with what she called the “official” instructions, but becoming increasingly
bad-tempered as they yielded poorer results than the Prince’s.
Harry wondered vaguely who the Half-Blood Prince had been. Although
the amount of homework they had been given prevented him from reading the
whole of his copy of 
Advanced Potion-Making,
 he had skimmed through it
sufficiently to see that there was barely a page on which the Prince had not
made additional notes, not all of th ing Ginny when she ought to be working hard for
her examinations.
“The so-called Half-Blood Prince.”
“Oh, not again,” he groaned. “Will you please drop it?”
He had not dared to return to the Room of Requirement to retrieve his
book, and his performance in Potions was suffering accordingly (though
Slughorn, who approved of Ginny, had jocularly attributed this to Harry being
lovesick). But Harry was sure that Snape had not yet given up hope of layinghands on the Prince’s book, and was determined to leave it where it was while
Snape remained on the lookout.
“I’m not dropping it,” said Hermione firmly, “until you’ve heard me out.
Now, I’ve been trying to find out a bit about who might make a hobby of
inventing Dark spells —”
“He didn’t make a hobby of it —”
“He, he — who says it’s a he?”
“We’ve been through this,” said Harry crossly. “
Prince,
 Hermione,
Prince
!”
“Right!” said Hermione, red patches blazing in her cheeks as she pulled a
very old piece of newsprint out of her pocket and slammed it down on the
tabl n birth to a —”
“— murderer,” spat Harry.
“Well . . . yes,” said Hermione. “So . . . I was sort of right. Snape must have
been proud of being ‘half a Prince,’ you see? Tobias Snape was a Muggle
from what it said in the 
Prophet.
”
“Yeah, that fits,” said Harry. “He’d play up the pure-blood side so he could
get in with Lucius Malfoy and the rest of them. . . . He’s just like Voldemort.
Pure-blood mother, Muggle father . . . ashamed of his parentage, trying to
make himself feared using the Dark Arts, gave himself an impressive new
name — 
Lord
 Voldemort — the Half-Blood 
Prince —
 how could Dumbledore
have missed — ?”
He broke off, looking out the window. He could not stop himself dwelling
upon Dumbledore’s inexcusable trust in Snape . . . but as Hermione had just
inadvertently reminded him, he, Harry, had been taken in just the same. . . . Inspite of the increasing nastiness of those scribbled spells, he had refused to
believe ill of the boy who had been so clever, who had helped him so
much. . . .
Helped him"
What is the spell to summon objects?,Accio,"According to the text, Bellatrix Lestrange is about to summon her master, Voldemort, by touching the Dark Mark on her arm.","pened behind Harry. A woman spoke, and the
sound of the voice wound Harry’s fear to an even higher pitch.
“What is this? What’s happened, Cissy?”
Bellatrix Lestrange walked slowly around the prisoners, and stopped on
Harry’s right, staring at Hermione through her heavily lidded eyes.
“But surely,” she said quietly, “this is the Mudblood girl? This is Granger?”
“Yes, yes, it’s Granger!” cried Lucius. “And beside her, we think, Potter!
Potter and his friends, caught at last!”
“Potter?” shrieked Bellatrix, and she backed away, the better to take in
Harry. “Are you sure? Well then, the Dark Lord must be informed at once!”
She dragged back her left sleeve: Harry saw the Dark Mark burned into the
flesh of her arm, and knew that she was about to touch it, to summon her
beloved master —
“I was about to call him!” said Lucius, and his hand actually closed upon
Bellatrix’s wrist, preventing her from touching the Mark. “
I 
shall summon
him, Bella, Potter has been brought to my house, and it is therefore upon my
authori he Heir of
Slytherin; I am sure that Voldemort considered it of stupendous importance.”
“So, the other Horcruxes?” said Harry. “Do you think you know what they
are, sir?”
“I can only guess,” said Dumbledore. “For the reasons I have alreadygiven, I believe that Lord Voldemort would prefer objects that, in themselves,
have a certain grandeur. I have therefore trawled back through Voldemort’s
past to see if I can find evidence that such artifacts have disappeared around
him.”
“The locket!” said Harry loudly. “Hufflepuff’s cup!”
“Yes,” said Dumbledore, smiling, “I would be prepared to bet — perhaps
not my other hand — but a couple of fingers, that they became Horcruxes
three and four. The remaining two, assuming again that he created a total of
six, are more of a problem, but I will hazard a guess that, having secured
objects from Hufflepuff and Slytherin, he set out to track down objects owned
by Gryffindor or Ravenclaw. Four objects from the four founders would, I am
sure, have exerted a powerful pull over Vold  she backed away, the better to take in

I 
shall summon

authority —”
“Your authority!” she sneered, attempting to wrench her hand from his
grasp. “You lost your authority when you lost your wand, Lucius! How dare
you! Take your hands off me!”
“This is nothing to do with you, you did not capture the boy —”
“Begging your pardon, 
Mr. 
Malfoy,” interjected Greyback, “but it’s us that
caught Potter, and it’s us that’ll be claiming the gold —”
“Gold!” laughed Bellatrix, still attempting to throw off her brother-in-law,
her free hand groping in her pocket for her wand. “Take is own precious soul? You are forgetting what I have showed you.
Lord Voldemort liked to collect trophies, and he preferred objects with a
powerful magical history. His pride, his belief in his own superiority, his
determination to carve for himself a startling place in magical history; these
things suggest to me that Voldemort would have chosen his Horcruxes with
some care, favoring objects worthy of the honor.”
“The diary wasn’t that special.”
“The diary, as you have said yourself, was proof that he was the Heir of
Slytherin; I am sure that Voldemort considered it of stupendous importance.”
“So, the other Horcruxes?” said Harry. “Do you think you know what they
are, sir?”
“I can only guess,” said Dumbledore. “For the reasons I have alreadygiven, I believe that Lord Voldemort would prefer objects that, in themselves,

sure, have exerted a powerful pull over Voldemort’s imagination. I cannot
answer for whether he ever managed to find anything of Ravenclaw’s. I am
confident, however, that the only known relic of Gryffindor remains safe.”
Dumbledore pointed his blackened fingers to the wall behind him, where a
ruby-encrusted sword reposed within a glass case.
“Do you think that’s why he really wanted to come back to Hogwarts, sir?”
said Harry. “To try and find something from one of the other founders?”
“My thoughts precisely,” said Dumbledore. “But unfortunately, tha off Malfoy’s
restraining arm. “But if I can, I will, the Dark Lord wants him dead anyway,
what’s the diff — ?”
A jet of scarlet light shot past Harry by inches: Hermione had run around
the corner behind him and sent a Stunning Spell straight at Crabbe’s head. It
only missed because Malfoy pulled him out of the way.
“It’s that Mudblood! 
Avada Kedavra!
”
Harry saw Hermione dive aside, and his fury that Crabbe had aimed to kill
wiped all else from his mind. He shot a Stunning Spell at Crabbe, who
lurched out of the way, knocking Malfoy’s wand out of his hand; it rolled out
of sight beneath a mountain of broken furniture and boxes.
“Don’t kill him! DON’T KILL HIM!” Malfoy yelled at Crabbe and Goyle,
who were both aiming at Harry: Their split second’s hesitation was all Harry
needed.
“Expelliarmus!”Goyle’s wand flew out of his hand and disappeared into the bulwark of
objects beside him; Goyle leapt foolishly on the spot, trying to retrieve it;
Malfoy jumped out of range of Hermione’s second Stunning Spell, and Ro k than either of the
others. Difficult and dangerous though it would undoubtedly be, Moody was
right: Harry had managed to find his way past monstrous creatures and
enchanted barriers before now, and this time he had some notice, some chance
to prepare himself for what lay ahead.
Tired of walking in on Harry, Hermione, and Ron all over the school,Professor McGonagall had given them permission to use the empty
Transfiguration classroom at lunchtimes. Harry had soon mastered the
Impediment Curse, a spell to slow down and obstruct attackers; the Reductor
Curse, which would enable him to blast solid objects out of his way; and the
Four-Point Spell, a useful discovery of Hermione’s that would make his wand
point due north, therefore enabling him to check whether he was going in the
right direction within the maze. He was still having trouble with the Shield
Charm, though. This was supposed to cast a temporary, invisible wall around
himself that deflected minor curses; Hermione managed to shatter it with a
well-pla e’s something there,” he whispered, “it could be the scar, stretched
tight. . . . Draco, come here, look properly! What do you think?”
Harry saw Draco’s face up close now, right beside his father’s. They were
extraordinarily alike, except that while his father looked beside himself with
excitement, Draco’s expression was full of reluctance, even fear.
“I don’t know,” he said, and he walked away toward the fireplace where his
mother stood watching.
“We had better be certain, Lucius,” Narcissa called to her husband in her
cold, clear voice. “Completely sure that it is Potter, before we summon the
Dark Lord . . . They say this is his” — she was looking closely at the
blackthorn wand — “but it does not resemble Ollivander’s description. . . . If
we are mistaken, if we call the Dark Lord here for nothing . . . Remember
what he did to Rowle and Dolohov?”
“What about the Mudblood, then?” growled Greyback. Harry was nearly
thrown off his feet as the Snatchers forced the prisoners to swivel around
again, so that the l"
Who is the defense against the dark arts teacher in Harry's first year?,Quirinus Quirrell,The Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher in Harry's first year is Professor Quirrell.,"was still fighting his way across the
lake with the first years; Professor McGonagall was presumably supervisingthe drying of the entrance hall floor, but there was another empty chair too,
and Harry couldn’t think who else was missing.
“Where’s the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher?” said Hermione,
who was also looking up at the teachers.
They had never yet had a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher who had
lasted more than three terms. Harry’s favorite by far had been Professor
Lupin, who had resigned last year. He looked up and down the staff table.
There was definitely no new face there.
“Maybe they couldn’t get anyone!” said Hermione, looking anxious.
Harry scanned the table more carefully. Tiny little Professor Flitwick, the
Charms teacher, was sitting on a large pile of cushions beside Professor
Sprout, the Herbology teacher, whose hat was askew over her flyaway gray
hair. She was talking to Professor Sinistra of the Astronomy department. On
Professor Sinistra’s other side was the sallow-faced ter the Defense Against the Dark Arts job again, sir? He didn’t
say. . . .”“Oh, he definitely wanted the Defense Against the Dark Arts job,” said
Dumbledore. “The aftermath of our little meeting proved that. You see, we

longer than a year since I refused the post to Lord Voldemort.”H

arry wracked his brains over the next week as to how he was to
persuade Slughorn to hand over the true memory, but nothing in the
nature of a brain wave occurred and he was reduced to doing what he did
increasingly these days when at a loss: poring over his Potions book, hoping
that the Prince would have scribbled something useful in a margin, as he had
done so many times before.
“You won’t find anything in there,” said Hermione firmly, late on Sunday
evening.
“Don’t start, Hermione,” said Harry. “If it hadn’t been for the Prince, Ron
wouldn’t be sitting here now.”
“He would if you’d just listened to Snape in our fir into Dumbledore’s face. “Why did
he come back? Did you ever find out?”
“I have ideas,” said Dumbledore, “but no more than that.”
“What ideas, sir?”
“I shall tell you, Harry, when you have retrieved that memory from
Professor Slughorn,” said Dumbledore. “When you have that last piece of the
jigsaw, everything will, I hope, be clear . . . to both of us.”
Harry was still burning with curiosity and even though Dumbledore had
walked to the door and was holding it open for him, he did not move at once.
“Was he after the Defense Against the Dark Arts job again, sir? He didn’t
say. . . .”“Oh, he definitely wanted the Defense Against the Dark Arts job,” said
Dumbledore. “The aftermath of our little meeting proved that. You see, we
have never been able to keep a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher for
longer than a year since I refused the post to Lord Voldemort.”H
 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-ONE
THE UNKNOWABLE ROOM
arry wracked his brains over the next week as to how he was to
persuade Slughorn to hand over the true memory, b ogether, turning to stare at Harry. “But
you said —”
“Professor Snape, meanwhile,” said Dumbledore, raising his voice so that it
carried over all the muttering, “will be taking over the position of Defense
Against the Dark Arts teacher.”
“No!” said Harry, so loudly that many heads turned in his direction. He didnot care; he was staring up at the staff table, incensed. How could Snape be
given the Defense Against the Dark Arts job after all this time? Hadn’t it been
widely known for years that Dumbledore did not trust him to do it?
“But Harry, you said that Slughorn was going to be teaching Defense
Against the Dark Arts!” said Hermione.
“I thought he was!” said Harry, racking his brains to remember when
Dumbledore had told him this, but now that he came to think of it, he was
unable to recall Dumbledore ever telling him what Slughorn would be
teaching.
Snape, who was sitting on Dumbledore’s right, did not stand up at the
mention of his name; he merely raised a hand in lazy acknowledgment of the
applause from t  — yeah, all right,” said Harry. He turned back to Hermione, Ron, and
Nearly Headless Nick. “Brothers and sisters usually go in the same Houses,
don’t they?” he said. He was judging by the Weasleys, all seven of whom had
been put into Gryffindor.
“Oh no, not necessarily,” said Hermione. “Parvati Patil’s twin’s in
Ravenclaw, and they’re identical. You’d think they’d be together, wouldn’t
you?”
Harry looked up at the staff table. There seemed to be rather more empty
seats there than usual. Hagrid, of course, was still fighting his way across the
lake with the first years; Professor McGonagall was presumably supervisingthe drying of the entrance hall floor, but there was another empty chair too,
and Harry couldn’t think who else was missing.
“Where’s the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher?” said Hermione,
who was also looking up at the teachers.
They had never yet had a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher who had
lasted more than three terms. Harry’s favorite by far had been Professor
Lupin, who had res  instead, though eyes continued to
dart back regularly to Harry.“Well . . . erm . . . well, you know why you’re here. Erm . . . well, Harry
here had the idea — I mean” — Harry had thrown her a sharp look — “I had
the idea — that it might be good if people who wanted to study Defense
Against the Dark Arts — and I mean, really study it, you know, not the
rubbish that Umbridge is doing with us” — (Hermione’s voice became
suddenly much stronger and more confident) — “because nobody could call
that Defense Against the Dark Arts” — “Hear, hear,” said Anthony Goldstein,
and Hermione looked heartened — “well, I thought it would be good if we,
well, took matters into our own hands.”
She paused, looked sideways at Harry, and went on, “And by that I mean
learning how to defend ourselves properly, not just theory but the real spells
—”
“You want to pass your Defense Against the Dark Arts O.W.L. too though,
I bet?” said Michael Corner.
“Of course I do,” said Hermione at once. “But I want more than that, I want
to be prope  prefects, and our new Head Boy and Girl,
to make sure that no student runs afoul of the dementors,” he said.
Percy, who was sitting a few seats down from Harry, puffed out his chestagain and stared around impressively. Dumbledore paused again; he looked
very seriously around the hall, and nobody moved or made a sound.
“On a happier note,” he continued, “I am pleased to welcome two new
teachers to our ranks this year.
“First, Professor Lupin, who has kindly consented to fill the post of
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.”
There was some scattered, rather unenthusiastic applause. Only those who
had been in the compartment on the train with Professor Lupin clapped hard,
Harry among them. Professor Lupin looked particularly shabby next to all the
other teachers in their best robes.
“Look at Snape!” Ron hissed in Harry’s ear.
Professor Snape, the Potions master, was staring along the staff table at
Professor Lupin. It was common knowledge that Snape wanted the Defense
Against the Dark Arts job, but even Harry the feeling Hermione’s not telling us something?” Ron asked
Harry.
Professor Lupin wasn’t there when they arrived at his first Defense Against
the Dark Arts lesson. They all sat down, took out their books, quills, and
parchment, and were talking when he finally entered the room. Lupin smiled
vaguely and placed his tatty old briefcase on the teacher’s desk. He was as
shabby as ever but looked healthier than he had on the train, as though he had
had a few square meals.
“Good afternoon,” he said. “Would you please put all your books back in
your bags. Today’s will be a practical lesson. You will need only your

A few curious looks were exchanged as the class put away their books.
They had never had a practical Defense Against the Dark Arts before, unless
you counted the memorable class last year when their old teacher had brought
a cageful of pixies to class and set them loose.
“Right then,” said Professor Lupin, when everyone was ready. “If you’d

dog’s noses sniffed madly in their direction, even though it couldn’t see them.
“What’s that at its feet?” Hermione whispered.
“Looks like a harp,” said Ron. “Snape must have left it there.”
“It must wake up the moment you stop playing,” said Harry. “Well, here
goes . . .”
He put Hagrid’s flute to his lips and blew. It wasn’t really a tune, but from
the first note the beast’s eyes began to droop. Harry hardly drew breath.
Slowly, the dog’s growls ceased — it tottered on its paws and fell to its knees,
then it slumped to the ground, fast asleep.
“Keep playing,” Ron warned Harry as they slipped out of the Cloak and
crept toward the trapdoor. They could feel the dog’s hot, smelly breath as they
approached the giant heads.
“I think we’ll be able to pull the door open,” said Ron, peering over the
dog’s back. “Want to go first, Hermione?”
“No, I don’t!”“All right.” Ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dog’s legs.
He bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor, which  ault seven hundred and thirteen was.M
 
CHAPTER  TEN
HALLOWEEN
alfoy couldn’t believe his eyes when he saw that Harry and Ron were
still at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful.
Indeed, by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the three-
headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were quite keen to have
another one. In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the package that
seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot
of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection.
“It’s either really valuable or really dangerous,” said Ron.
“Or both,” said Harry.
But as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was
about two inches long, they didn’t have much chance of guessing what it was
without further clues.
Neither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay
underneath the dog and the trapdoor. All Neville cared about was never going
near the dog again.
Hermione was now refusing to spea ok — read that, there.”
She pushed the book toward them, and Harry and Ron read:
The ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the
Sorcerer’s Stone, a legendary substance with astonishing powers.
The Stone will transform any metal into pure gold. It also produces
the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal.
There have been many reports of the Sorcerer’s Stone over the
centuries, but the only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr.
Nicolas Flamel, the noted alchemist and opera lover. Mr. Flamel,
who celebrated his six hundred and sixty-fifth birthday last year,
enjoys a quiet life in Devon with his wife, Perenelle (six hundred
and fifty-eight).
“See?” said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had finished. “The dog must be
guarding Flamel’s Sorcerer’s Stone! I bet he asked Dumbledore to keep it safe
for him, because they’re friends and he knew someone was after it, that’s why
he wanted the Stone moved out of Gringotts!”
“A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying!” said Harry. “No

then it slumped to the ground, fast asleep.
“Keep playing,” Ron warned Harry as they slipped out of the Cloak and
crept toward the trapdoor. They could feel the dog’s hot, smelly breath as they
approached the giant heads.
“I think we’ll be able to pull the door open,” said Ron, peering over the
dog’s back. “Want to go first, Hermione?”
“No, I don’t!”“All right.” Ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dog’s legs.
He bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor, which swung up and open.
“What can you see?” Hermione said anxiously.
“Nothing — just black — there’s no way of climbing down, we’ll just have
to drop.”
Harry, who was still playing the flute, waved at Ron to get his attention and
pointed at himself.
“You want to go first? Are you sure?” said Ron. “I don’t know how deep
this thing goes. Give the flute to Hermione so she can keep him asleep.”
Harry handed the flute over. In the few seconds’ silence, the dog growled
and twitched, but the moment Hermione began to pl  knew you’d seen me coming to look at what was guarding
the Stone.”
“
You
 let the troll in?”
“Certainly. I have a special gift with trolls — you must have seen what I
did to the one in the chamber back there? Unfortunately, while everyone else
was running around looking for it, Snape, who already suspected me, went
straight to the third floor to head me off — and not only did my troll fail to
beat you to death, that three-headed dog didn’t even manage to bite Snape’s
leg off properly.
“Now, wait quietly, Potter. I need to examine this interesting mirror.”
It was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell. It
was the Mirror of Erised.
“This mirror is the key to finding the Stone,” Quirrell murmured, tapping
his way around the frame. “Trust Dumbledore to come up with something like
this . . . but he’s in London . . . I’ll be far away by the time he gets back. . . .”
All Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and stop him
from concentrating on the mirror.
“I saw you and Sna hen, “let’s keep looking,” and he turned away,
wishing he had not seen the stone: He did not want his excited trepidation
tainted with resentment.
“Here!” cried Hermione again a few moments later from out of the
darkness. “Oh no, sorry! I thought it said Potter.”
She was rubbing at a crumbling, mossy stone, gazing down at it, a little
frown on her face.
“Harry, come back a moment.”He did not want to be sidetracked again, and only grudgingly made his way
back through the snow toward her.
“What?”
“Look at this!”
The grave was extremely old, weathered so that Harry could hardly make
out the name. Hermione showed him the symbol beneath it.
“Harry, that’s the mark in the book!”
He peered at the place she indicated: The stone was so worn that it was
hard to make out what was engraved there, though there did seem to be a
triangular mark beneath the nearly illegible name.
“Yeah . . . it could be. . . .”
Hermione lit her wand and pointed it at the name on the headstone.
“It says Ig
 — 
Ignotus, I think. . . .”
“I’m go  nose flat against
the glass. Crookshanks seemed to have come to a halt. Harry was sure he
could see something else moving in the shadow of the trees too.
And just then, it emerged — a gigantic, shaggy black dog, moving
stealthily across the lawn, Crookshanks trotting at its side. Harry stared. What
did this mean? If Crookshanks could see the dog as well, how could it be an
omen of Harry’s death?
“Ron!” Harry hissed. “Ron! Wake up!”
“Huh?”
“I need you to tell me if you can see something!”
“S’all dark, Harry,” Ron muttered thickly. “What’re you on about?”
“Down here —”
Harry looked quickly back out of the window.
Crookshanks and the dog had vanished. Harry climbed onto the windowsill
to look right down into the shadows of the castle, but they weren’t there.
Where had they gone?
A loud snore told him Ron had fallen asleep again.
Harry and the rest of the Gryffindor team entered the Great Hall the next day
to enormous applause. Harry couldn’t help grinning broadly as he saw that
both the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff n’t kill,
they just turn you into one of them?”
“They sometimes kill,” said Ron, who looked unusually grave now. “I’ve
heard of it happening when the werewolf gets carried away.”
“What was the werewolf’s name?” said Harry quickly.
“Well, the rumor is that it was that Fenrir Greyback,” said Hermione.
“I knew it — the maniac who likes attacking kids, the one Lupin told meabout!” said Harry angrily.
Hermione looked at him bleakly.
“Harry, you’ve got to get that memory,” she said. “It’s all about stopping
Voldemort, isn’t it? These dreadful things that are happening are all down to
him. . . .”
The bell rang overhead in the castle and both Hermione and Ron jumped to
their feet, looking terrified.
“You’ll do fine,” Harry told them both, as they headed toward the entrance
hall to meet the rest of the people taking their Apparition Test. “Good luck.”
“And you too!” said Hermione with a significant look, as Harry headed off
to the dungeons.
There were only three of them in Potions that afternoon: Harry, Ernie, and

What creature is Aragog?,Acromantula,Aragog is a giant spider.,"pes shifted all around him.
“The thing that lives in the castle,” said Aragog, “is an ancient creature we
spiders fear above all others. Well do I remember how I pleaded with Hagrid
to let me go, when I sensed the beast moving about the school.”
“What is it?” said Harry urgently.
More loud clicking, more rustling; the spiders seemed to be closing in.
“We do not speak of it!” said Aragog fiercely. “We do not name it! I never
even told Hagrid the name of that dread creature, though he asked me, many
times.”
Harry didn’t want to press the subject, not with the spiders pressing closer
on all sides. Aragog seemed to be tired of talking. He was backing slowly into
his domed web, but his fellow spiders continued to inch slowly toward Harry
and Ron.
“We’ll just go, then,” Harry called desperately to Aragog, hearing leaves
rustling behind him.
“Go?” said Aragog slowly. “I think not. . . .”
“But — but —”
“My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid, on my command. But I
cannot deny them fresh meat, when it wanders so will t me coming down here, Hagrid.”
“Not in trouble, are yeh?” said Hagrid, looking up, alarmed. “Yeh shouldn’
be outta the castle in the evenin’, I know it, it’s my fault —”
“No, no, when he heard what I was doing he said he’d like to come and pay
his last respects to Aragog too,” said Harry. “He’s gone to change into
something more suitable, I think . . . and he said he’d bring some bottles so
we can drink to Aragog’s memory. . . .”
“Did he?” said Hagrid, looking both astonished and touched. “Tha’s —
tha’s righ’ nice of him, that is, an’ not turnin’ yeh in either. I’ve never really
had a lot ter do with Horace Slughorn before. . . . Comin’ ter see old Aragog
off, though, eh? Well . . . he’d’ve liked that, Aragog would. . . .”
Harry thought privately that what Aragog would have liked most about
Slughorn was the ample amount of edible flesh he provided, but he merely
moved to the rear window of Hagrid’s hut, where he saw the rather horrible
sight of the enormous dead spider lying on its back outside, its legs cur  been my instinct, but out of
respect for Hagrid, I never harmed a human. The body of the girl who was
killed was discovered in a bathroom. I never saw any part of the castle but the
cupboard in which I grew up. Our kind like the dark and the quiet. . . .”
“But then . . . Do you know what 
did
 kill that girl?” said Harry. “Because
whatever it is, it’s back and attacking people again —”
His words were drowned by a loud outbreak of clicking and the rustling of
many long legs shifting angrily; large black shapes shifted all around him.
“The thing that lives in the castle,” said Aragog, “is an ancient creature we
spiders fear above all others. Well do I remember how I pleaded with Hagrid
to let me go, when I sensed the beast moving about the school.”
“What is it?” said Harry urgently.
More loud clicking, more rustling; the spiders seemed to be closing in.
“We do not speak of it!” said Aragog fiercely. “We do not name it! I never
even told Hagrid the name of that dread creature, though he asked me, many
times.”
H  Aragog was the only thing that stopped them from eating
Hagrid.
“Never bin an area o’ the forest I couldn’ go before!” said Hagrid, shaking
his head. “It wasn’ easy, gettin’ Aragog’s body out o’ there, I can tell yeh —
they usually eat their dead, see. . . . But I wanted ter give ’im a nice burial . . .
a proper send-off . . .”
He broke into sobs again and Harry resumed the patting of his elbow,
saying as he did so (for the potion seemed to indicate that it was the rightthing to do), “Professor Slughorn met me coming down here, Hagrid.”
“Not in trouble, are yeh?” said Hagrid, looking up, alarmed. “Yeh shouldn’
be outta the castle in the evenin’, I know it, it’s my fault —”
“No, no, when he heard what I was doing he said he’d like to come and pay
his last respects to Aragog too,” said Harry. “He’s gone to change into
something more suitable, I think . . . and he said he’d bring some bottles so
we can drink to Aragog’s memory. . . .”
“Did he?” said Hagrid, looking both astonished and touched. “Tha’s —
tha’s ri oad.
Harry fell to the ground on all fours as the spider released him. Ron and
Fang thudded down next to him. Fang wasn’t howling anymore, but cowering
silently on the spot. Ron looked exactly like Harry felt. His mouth was
stretched wide in a kind of silent scream and his eyes were popping.
Harry suddenly realized that the spider that had dropped him was saying
something. It had been hard to tell, because he clicked his pincers with every
word he spoke.
“Aragog!” it called. “Aragog!”
And from the middle of the misty, domed web, a spider the size of a small
elephant emerged, very slowly. There was gray in the black of his body and
legs, and each of the eyes on his ugly, pincered head was milky white. He was
blind.
“What is it?” he said, clicking his pincers rapidly.
“Men,” clicked the spider who had caught Harry.
“Is it Hagrid?” said Aragog, moving closer, his eight milky eyes wandering
vaguely.
“Strangers,” clicked the spider who had brought Ron.
“Kill them,” clicked Aragog fretfully. “I was sleeping. . . .”  onto his bed without bothering to get undressed. Harry, however,
didn’t feel very sleepy. He sat on the edge of his four-poster, thinking hard
about everything Aragog had said.
The creature that was lurking somewhere in the castle, he thought, sounded
like a sort of monster Voldemort — even other monsters didn’t want to name
it. But he and Ron were no closer to finding out what it was, or how it
Petrified its victims. Even Hagrid had never known what was in the Chamber
of Secrets.Harry swung his legs up onto his bed and leaned back against his pillows,
watching the moon glinting at him through the tower window.
He couldn’t see what else they could do. They had hit dead ends
everywhere. Riddle had caught the wrong person, the Heir of Slytherin had
got off, and no one could tell whether it was the same person, or a different
one, who had opened the Chamber this time. There was nobody else to ask.
Harry lay down, still thinking about what Aragog had said.
He was becoming drowsy when what seemed like their very  eyes streaming as he
mopped his face with his apron. “It’s . . . Aragog. . . . I think he’s dyin’. . . .
He got ill over the summer an’ he’s not gettin’ better. . . . I don’ know what I’ll
do if he . . . if he . . . We’ve bin tergether so long. . . .”
Hermione patted Hagrid’s shoulder, looking at a complete loss for anything
to say. Harry knew how she felt. He had known Hagrid to present a vicious
baby dragon with a teddy bear, seen him croon over giant scorpions with
suckers and stingers, attempt to reason with his brutal giant of a half-brother,
but this was perhaps the most incomprehensible of all his monster fancies: the
gigantic talking spider, Aragog, who dwelled deep in the Forbidden Forest
and which he and Ron had only narrowly escaped four years previously.
“Is there — is there anything we can do?” Hermione asked, ignoring Ron’s
frantic grimaces and head-shakings.
“I don’ think there is, Hermione,” choked Hagrid, attempting to stem the
flood of his tears. “See, the rest o’ the tribe . . . Aragog’s fa  frightened. Harry could not see
why. The hall was quite empty but for themselves, the sobbing Bellatrix still
trapped under her statue, and the tiny baby Fawkes croaking feebly on the
floor —
And then Harry’s scar burst open. He knew he was dead: it was pain
beyond imagining, pain past endurance —
He was gone from the hall, he was locked in the coils of a creature with red
eyes, so tightly bound that Harry did not know where his body ended and the
creature’s began. They were fused together, bound by pain, and there was no
escape —
And when the creature spoke, it used Harry’s mouth, so that in his agony he
felt his jaw move. . . .
“Kill me now, Dumbledore . . .”
Blinded and dying, every part of him screaming for release, Harry felt the
creature use him again. . . .
“If death is nothing, Dumbledore, kill the boy . . .”Let the pain stop,
 thought Harry. 
Let him kill us. . . . End it,
Dumbledore. . . . Death is nothing compared to this. . . .
And I’ll see Sirius again. . . .

face.
“Of course, it doesn’t matter how he looks. . . . It’s not r-really

handsome . . . and he was g-going to be married!”
“And what do you mean by zat?” said Fleur suddenly and loudly. “What do
you mean, ‘’e was

Mrs. Weasley raised her tear-stained face, looking startled. “Well — only

“You theenk Bill will not wish to marry me anymore?” demanded Fleur.
“You theenk, because of these bites, he will not love me?”“No, that’s not what I —”
“Because ’e will!” said Fleur, drawing herself up to her full height and
throwing back her long mane of silver hair. “It would take more zan a
werewolf to stop Bill loving me!”
“Well, yes, I’m sure,” said Mrs. Weasley, “but I thought perhaps — given
how — how he —”
“You thought I would not weesh to marry him? Or per’aps, you hoped?”
said Fleur, her nostrils flaring. “What do I care how he looks? I am g at he really is going to marry
her,” sighed Ginny later that evening, as she, Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat
beside the open window of the Gryffindor common room, looking out over
the twilit grounds.
“She’s not that bad,” said Harry. “Ugly, though,” he added hastily, as Ginny
raised her eyebrows, and she let out a reluctant giggle.
“Well, I suppose if Mum can stand it, I can.”
“Anyone else we know died?” Ron asked Hermione, who was perusing the
Evening Prophet.
Hermione winced at the forced toughness in his voice. “No,” she said
reprovingly, folding up the newspaper. “They’re still looking for Snape but no
sign . . .”
“Of course there isn’t,” said Harry, who became angry every time this
subject cropped up. “They won’t find Snape till they find Voldemort, and
seeing as they’ve never managed to do that in all this time . . .”“I’m going to go to bed,” yawned Ginny. “I haven’t been sleeping that well
since . . . well . . . I could do with some sleep.”

under his breath.
Harry waited until they could hear Xenophilius moving about in the kitchen
downstairs before speaking.
“What do you think?” he asked Hermione.
“Oh, Harry,” she said wearily, “it’s a pile of utter rubbish. This can’t be
what the sign really means. This must just be his weird take on it. What a
waste of time.”
“I s’pose this 
is
 the man who brought us Crumple-Horned Snorkacks,” said
Ron.
“You don’t believe it either?” Harry asked him.
“Nah, that story’s just one of those things you tell kids to teach them
lessons, isn’t it? ‘Don’t go looking for trouble, don’t pick fights, don’t go
messing around with stuff that’s best left alone! Just keep your head down,
mind your own business, and you’ll be okay.’ Come to think of it,” Ron
added, “maybe that story’s why elder wands are supposed to be unlucky.”“What are you talking about?”
“One of those superstitions, isn’t it? ‘May-born witches will marry
Muggles.’ ‘Jinx by twilight, undon er Madam Pomfrey’s care. His scars were as bad as ever

thankfully with both eyes and legs — but in personality he seemed just the
same as ever. All that appeared to have changed was that he now had a great
liking for very rare steaks.
“. . . so eet ees lucky ’e is marrying me,” said Fleur happily, plumping up
Bill’s pillows, “because ze British overcook their meat, I ’ave always said
this.”
“I suppose I’m just going to have to accept that he really is going to marry
her,” sighed Ginny later that evening, as she, Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat
beside the open window of the Gryffindor common room, looking out over
the twilit grounds.
“She’s not that bad,” said Harry. “Ugly, though,” he added hastily, as Ginny
raised her eyebrows, and she let out a reluctant giggle.

Hermione winced at the forced toughness in his v  has been taking some for Winky
too, sir.”
“Yeah, how is Winky?” asked Harry.
Dobby’s ears drooped slightly.
“Winky is still drinking lots, sir,” he said sadly, his enormous round green
eyes, large as tennis balls, downcast. “She still does not care for clothes,
Harry Potter. Nor do the other house-elves. None of them will clean
Gryffindor Tower anymore, not with the hats and socks hidden everywhere,
they finds them insulting, sir. Dobby does it all himself, sir, but Dobby does
not mind, sir, for he always hopes to meet Harry Potter and tonight, sir, he has
got his wish!” Dobby sank into a deep bow again. “But Harry Potter does not
seem happy,” Dobby went on, straightening up again and looking timidly at
Harry. “Dobby heard him muttering in his sleep. Was Harry Potter having bad
dreams?”
“Not really bad,” said Harry, yawning and rubbing his eyes. “I’ve had
worse.”
The elf surveyed Harry out of his vast, orblike eyes. Then he said veryseriously, his ears drooping, “Dobby wishes he could help Harry Potter, for
 havior might be like
when he awakens. . . .”
Mrs. Weasley took the nasty-smelling ointment from Madam Pomfrey and
began dabbing at Bill’s wounds.
“And Dumbledore . . .” said Mr. Weasley. “Minerva, is it true . . . Is he
really . . . ?”
As Professor McGonagall nodded, Harry felt Ginny move beside him and
looked at her. Her slightly narrowed eyes were fixed upon Fleur, who was
gazing down at Bill with a frozen expression on her face.
“Dumbledore gone,” whispered Mr. Weasley, but Mrs. Weasley had eyes
only for her eldest son; she began to sob, tears falling onto Bill’s mutilated
face.
“Of course, it doesn’t matter how he looks. . . . It’s not r-really
important . . . but he was a very handsome little b-boy . . . always very
handsome . . . and he was g-going to be married!”
“And what do you mean by zat?” said Fleur suddenly and loudly. “What do
you mean, ‘’e was 
going
 to be married?’”
Mrs. Weasley raised her tear-stained face, looking startled. “Well — only
that —”
“You theenk Bill will not wish to marry me any  have you? Probably
wise. Be sure and marry a pureblood next time.”
Hermione had let out a little squeak of horror. Yaxley looked at her. She
coughed feebly and turned away.
“I — I —” stammered Ron.“But if 
my
 wife were accused of being a Mudblood,” said Yaxley, “— not
that any woman I married would ever be mistaken for such filth — and the
Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement needed a job doing, I
would make it my priority to do that job, Cattermole. Do you understand
me?”
“Yes,” whispered Ron.
“Then attend to it, Cattermole, and if my office is not completely dry
within an hour, your wife’s Blood Status will be in even graver doubt than it
is now.”
The golden grille before them clattered open. With a nod and unpleasant
smile to Harry, who was evidently expected to appreciate this treatment of
Cattermole, Yaxley swept away toward another lift. Harry, Ron, and
Hermione entered theirs, but nobody followed them: It was as if they were
infectious. The grilles shut with a clang and the lift began to u see!” said a strained voice. Tonks was glaring at Lupin. “She still
wants to marry him, even though he’s been bitten! She doesn’t care!”
“It’s different,” said Lupin, barely moving his lips and looking suddenly
tense. “Bill will not be a full werewolf. The cases are completely —”
“But I don’t care either, I don’t care!” said Tonks, seizing the front of
Lupin’s robes and shaking them. “I’ve told you a million times. . . .”And the meaning of Tonks’s Patronus and her mouse-colored hair, and the
reason she had come running to find Dumbledore when she had heard a rumor
someone had been attacked by Greyback, all suddenly became clear to Harry;
it had not been Sirius that Tonks had fallen in love with after all.
“And I’ve told 
you
 a million times,” said Lupin, refusing to meet her eyes,
staring at the floor, “that I am too old for you, too poor . . . too dangerous.
. . .”
“I’ve said all along you’re taking a ridiculous line on this, Remus,” said
Mrs. Weasley over Fleur’s shoulder as she patted her on the back.

Snape made a sudden movement, but as Harry looked at him, Snape’s eyes
flew back to Fudge.
“Malfoy was cleared!” said Fudge, visibly affronted. “A very old family —

“Macnair!” Harry continued.
“Also cleared! Now working for the Ministry!”
“Avery — Nott — Crabbe — Goyle —”
“You are merely repeating the names of those who were acquitted of being
Death Eaters thirteen years ago!” said Fudge angrily. “You could have found
those names in old reports of the trials! For heaven’s sake, Dumbledore — the
boy was full of some crackpot story at the end of last year too — his tales are

Dumbledore, and you still think he’s trustworthy?”
“You fool!” Professor McGonagall cried. “Cedric Diggory! Mr. Crouch!
These deaths were not the random work of a lunatic!”
“I see no evidence to the contrary!” shouted Fudge, now matching her
anger, his face purp owever, it was in his usual curt voice.
“We must follow the rules, and the rules state clearly that those people
whose names come out of the Goblet of Fire are bound to compete in the
tournament.”
“Well, Barty knows the rule book back to front,” said Bagman, beaming
and turning back to Karkaroff and Madame Maxime, as though the matter
was now closed.
“I insist upon resubmitting the names of the rest of my students,” saidKarkaroff. He had dropped his unctuous tone and his smile now. His face
wore a very ugly look indeed. “You will set up the Goblet of Fire once more,
and we will continue adding names until each school has two champions. It’s
only fair, Dumbledore.”
“But Karkaroff, it doesn’t work like that,” said Bagman. “The Goblet of
Fire’s just gone out — it won’t reignite until the start of the next tournament
—”
“— in which Durmstrang will most certainly not be competing!” exploded
Karkaroff. “After all our meetings and negotiations and compromises, I little

“Which was a wise move, wasn’t it, as it prevented someone like you,
Karkaroff, from turning all of them in,” muttered Moody.
“Yet you say you have

“I — I do,” said Karkaroff breathlessly. “And these were important
supporters, mark you. People I saw with my own eyes doing his bidding. I
give this information as a sign that I fully and totally renounce him, and am
filled with a remorse so deep I can barely —”
“These names are?” said Mr. Crouch sharply.
Karkaroff drew a deep breath.
“There was Antonin Dolohov,” he said. “I — I saw him torture countless
Muggles and — and non-supporters of the Dark Lord.”
“And helped him do it,” murmured Moody.
“We have already app edore made a small noise of dissent through his long, crooked nose.
“Ah, I was forgetting . . . you don’t like the dementors, do you, Albus?”
said Moody with a sardonic smile.“No,” said Dumbledore calmly, “I’m afraid I don’t. I have long felt the
Ministry is wrong to ally itself with such creatures.”
“But for filth like this . . .” Moody said softly.
“You say you have names for us, Karkaroff,” said Mr. Crouch. “Let us hear
them, please.”
“You must understand,” said Karkaroff hurriedly, “that He-Who-Must-Not-

“Get on with it,” sneered Moody.
“— we never knew the names of every one of our fellows — He alone
knew exactly who we all were —”
“Which was a wise move, wasn’t it, as it prevented someone like you,
Karkaroff, from turning all of them in,” muttered Moody.
“Yet you say you have 
some
 names for us?” said Mr. Crouch.
“I — I do said the wizard called Phineas, eyeing this wand slightly
apprehensively, “though he may well have destroyed my picture by now, he’s
done most of the family —”
“Sirius knows not to destroy your portrait,” said Dumbledore, and Harry
realized immediately where he had heard Phineas’s voice before: issuing from
the apparently empty frame in his bedroom in Grimmauld Place. “You are to
give him the message that Arthur Weasley has been gravely injured and that
his wife, children, and Harry Potter will be arriving at his house shortly. Do
you understand?”
“Arthur Weasley, injured, wife and children and Harry Potter coming to
stay,” recited Phineas in a bored voice. “Yes, yes . . . very well . . .”
He sloped away into the frame of the portrait and disappeared from view at
the very moment that the study door opened again. Fred, George, and Ginny
were ushered inside by Professor McGonagall, all three of them looking
disheveled and shocked, still in their night things.
“Harry — what’s going on?” asked Ginny, who looked f hat’s
why Kreacher won’t take orders from her — he’s supposed to do whatever
anyone in the family asks him . . .”
“You and Tonks are related?” Harry asked, surprised.
“Oh yeah, her mother, Andromeda, was my favorite cousin,” said Sirius,
examining the tapestry carefully. “No, Andromeda’s not on here either, look
—”
He pointed to another small round burn mark between two names, Bellatrix
and Narcissa.
“Andromeda’s sisters are still here because they made lovely, respectable
pure-blood marriages, but Andromeda married a Muggle-born, Ted Tonks, so
—”
Sirius mimed blasting the tapestry with a wand and laughed sourly. Harry,
however, did not laugh; he was too busy staring at the names to the right of
Andromeda’s burn mark. A double line of gold embroidery linked NarcissaBlack with Lucius Malfoy, and a single vertical gold line from their names led
to the name Draco.
“You’re related to the Malfoys!”
“The pure-blood families are all interrelated,” said Sirius. “If you’re only
going to let your sons and daughters mar , drawing hoods over their faces and fleeing as
fast as they could. Hermione looked after them curiously, until the man with
the bloodied bandage came staggering right across her path.
“My children!” he bellowed, pointing at her. His voice was cracked, high-
pitched; he sounded distraught. “Where are my children? What has he done
with them? You know, 
you know
!”
“I — I really —” stammered Hermione.
The man lunged at her, reaching for her throat: Then, with a bang and a
burst of red light he was thrown backward onto the ground, unconscious. Ron
stood there, his wand still outstretched and a look of shock visible behind his
beard. Faces appeared at the windows on either side of the street, while a little
knot of prosperous-looking passersby gathered their robes about them and
broke into gentle trots, keen to vacate the scene.
Their entrance into Diagon Alley could hardly have been more
conspicuous; for a moment Harry wondered whether it might not be better toleave now and try to think of a different plan. Befo a married a Muggle-born, Ted Tonks, so
—”
Sirius mimed blasting the tapestry with a wand and laughed sourly. Harry,
however, did not laugh; he was too busy staring at the names to the right of
Andromeda’s burn mark. A double line of gold embroidery linked NarcissaBlack with Lucius Malfoy, and a single vertical gold line from their names led
to the name Draco.
“You’re related to the Malfoys!”
“The pure-blood families are all interrelated,” said Sirius. “If you’re only
going to let your sons and daughters marry purebloods your choice is very
limited, there are hardly any of us left. Molly and I are cousins by marriage
and Arthur’s something like my second cousin once removed. But there’s no
point looking for them on here — if ever a family was a bunch of blood
traitors it’s the Weasleys.”
But Harry was now looking at the name to the left of Andromeda’s burn:
Bellatrix Black, which was connected by a double line to Rodolphus
Lestrange.
“Lestrange . . .” Harry said aloud. The name had stirred something in his
mem"
What is the name of the wand shop in Diagon Alley?,Ollivanders,"According to the text, the wand shop in Diagon Alley is Ollivander's.","t Harry
could see through the dusty shop window was definitely not Diagon Alley.
The sooner he got out of here, the better. Nose still stinging where it had hit
the hearth, Harry made his way swiftly and silently toward the door, but
before he’d got halfway toward it, two people appeared on the other side of
the glass — and one of them was the very last person Harry wanted to meet
when he was lost, covered in soot, and wearing broken glasses: Draco Malfoy.
Harry looked quickly around and spotted a large black cabinet to his left;
he shot inside it and pulled the doors closed, leaving a small crack to peer
through. Seconds later, a bell clanged, and Malfoy stepped into the shop.
The man who followed could only be Draco’s father. He had the same pale,
pointed face and identical cold, gray eyes. Mr. Malfoy crossed the shop,
looking lazily at the items on display, and rang a bell on the counter before
turning to his son and saying, “Touch nothing, Draco.”
Malfoy, who had reached for the glass eye, said, “I though . He was a good man,
Florean.”
“Talking of Diagon Alley,” said Mr. Weasley, “looks like Ollivander’s gone
too.”
“The wandmaker?” said Ginny, looking startled.
“That’s the one. Shop’s empty. No sign of a struggle. No one knows
whether he left voluntarily or was kidnapped.”
“But wands — what’ll people do for wands?”
“They’ll make do with other makers,” said Lupin. “But Ollivander was the
best, and if the other side have got him it’s not so good for us.”
The day after this rather gloomy birthday tea, their letters and booklists
arrived from Hogwarts. Harry’s included a surprise: He had been made
Quidditch Captain.
“That gives you equal status with prefects!” cried Hermione happily. “You
can use our special bathroom now and everything!”
“Wow, I remember when Charlie wore one of these,” said Ron, examining
the badge with glee. “Harry, this is so cool, you’re my Captain — if you let
me back on the team, I suppose, ha ha. . . .”“Well, I don’t suppose we can put off a trip to Diagon Alley much longer
now you’ve got t ey, frowning, “perhaps we should talk about
something diff —”
“Did you hear about Florean Fortescue, Remus?” asked Bill, who was
being plied with wine by Fleur. “The man who ran —”
“— the ice-cream place in Diagon Alley?” Harry interrupted, with an
unpleasant, hollow sensation in the pit of his stomach. “He used to give me
free ice creams. What’s happened to him?”
“Dragged off, by the look of his place.”
“Why?” asked Ron, while Mrs. Weasley pointedly glared at Bill.
“Who knows? He must’ve upset them somehow. He was a good man,
Florean.”
“Talking of Diagon Alley,” said Mr. Weasley, “looks like Ollivander’s gone
too.”
“The wandmaker?” said Ginny, looking startled.
“That’s the one. Shop’s empty. No sign of a struggle. No one knows
whether he left voluntarily or was kidnapped.”
“But wands — what’ll people do for wands?”
“They’ll make do with other makers,” said Lupin. “But Ollivander was the
best, and if the other side have got him it’s not so good for us.”
The day after this rather gloomy birthday tea, their let , or Hermione
Granger this time.
Three boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle one at once: It was
the pale boy from Madam Malkin’s robe shop. He was looking at Harry with
a lot more interest than he’d shown back in Diagon Alley.
“Is it true?” he said. “They’re saying all down the train that Harry Potter’s
in this compartment. So it’s you, is it?”
“Yes,” said Harry. He was looking at the other boys. Both of them were
thickset and looked extremely mean. Standing on either side of the pale boy,
they looked like bodyguards.
“Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle,” said the pale boy carelessly, noticing
where Harry was looking. “And my name’s Malfoy, Draco Malfoy.”
Ron gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a snigger. Draco
Malfoy looked at him.
“Think my name’s funny, do you? No need to ask who you are. My father
told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children than they
can afford.”
He turned back to Harry. “You’ll soon find out some wizarding families are
much better than oth  glance at
Hermione, “now I know the kind of scum that shops here. . . . We’ll do better
at Twilfitt and Tatting’s.”
And with that, the pair of them strode out of the shop, Malfoy taking care
to bang as hard as he could into Ron on the way out.
“Well, 
really
!” said Madam Malkin, snatching up the fallen robes and
moving the tip of her wand over them like a vacuum cleaner, so that it
removed all the dust.
She was distracted all through the fitting of Ron’s and Harry’s new robes,
tried to sell Hermione wizard’s dress robes instead of witch’s, and when she
finally bowed them out of the shop it was with an air of being glad to see the
back of them.
“Got ev’rything?” asked Hagrid brightly when they reappeared at his side.
“Just about,” said Harry. “Did you see the Malfoys?”
“Yeah,” said Hagrid, unconcerned. “Bu’ they wouldn’ dare make trouble in
the middle o’ Diagon Alley, Harry. Don’ worry abou’ them.”
Harry, Ron, and Hermione exchanged looks, but before they could disabuse
Hagrid of this comfortable notion, Mr. e
 he was, he had
no idea. All he could tell was that he was standing in the stone fireplace of
what looked like a large, dimly lit wizard’s shop — but nothing in here was
ever likely to be on a Hogwarts school list.
A glass case nearby held a withered hand on a cushion, a bloodstained pack
of cards, and a staring glass eye. Evil-looking masks stared down from the
walls, an assortment of human bones lay upon the counter, and rusty, spiked
instruments hung from the ceiling. Even worse, the dark, narrow street Harry
could see through the dusty shop window was definitely not Diagon Alley.
The sooner he got out of here, the better. Nose still stinging where it had hit
the hearth, Harry made his way swiftly and silently toward the door, but
before he’d got halfway toward it, two people appeared on the other side of
the glass — and one of them was the very last person Harry wanted to meet
when he was lost, covered in soot, and wearing broken glasses: Draco Malfoy.
Harry looked quickly around and spotted a large bla eon.
“In Diagon Alley,” said Dumbledore. “I have your list of books and schoolequipment with me. I can help you find everything —”
“You’re coming with me?” asked Riddle, looking up.
“Certainly, if you —”
“I don’t need you,” said Riddle. “I’m used to doing things for myself, I go
round London on my own all the time. How do you get to this Diagon Alley
— sir?” he added, catching Dumbledore’s eye.
Harry thought that Dumbledore would insist upon accompanying Riddle,
but once again he was surprised. Dumbledore handed Riddle the envelope
containing his list of equipment, and after telling Riddle exactly how to get to
the Leaky Cauldron from the orphanage, he said, “You will be able to see it,
although Muggles around you — non-magical people, that is — will not. Ask
for Tom the barman — easy enough to remember, as he shares your name —”
Riddle gave an irritable twitch, as though trying to displace an irksome fly.
“You dislike the name ‘Tom’?”
“There are a lot of Toms,” muttered Riddle. Then, as though he could not
s ry. Ron, who was now helping himself to
Harry’s toast, was still gazing dreamily at the door.
“What’s this?” Hermione asked eventually, holding up what looked like a
small telescope.
“Dunno,” said Ron, “but if Fred and George’ve left it here, it’s probably
not ready for the joke shop yet, so be careful.”
“Your mum said the shop’s going well,” said Harry. “Said Fred and George
have got a real flair for business.”
“That’s an understatement,” said Ron. “They’re raking in the Galleons! I
can’t wait to see the place, we haven’t been to Diagon Alley yet, because
Mum says Dad’s got to be there for extra security and he’s been really busy at
work, but it sounds excellent.”
“And what about Percy?” asked Harry; the third-eldest Weasley brother had
fallen out with the rest of the family. “Is he talking to your mum and dad
again?”
“Nope,” said Ron.
“But he knows your dad was right all along now about Voldemort being
back

“Dumbledore says people find it far easier to forgive others for being
wrong than being right,” s"
Who is the head of Slytherin House?,Severus Snape,The head of Slytherin House is Salazar Slytherin.,"had tried to put me in Slytherin, I’d’ve got the
train straight back home. . . .”
Hermione nodded fervently, but Harry didn’t say anything. His stomach
had just dropped unpleasantly.
Harry had never told Ron and Hermione that the Sorting Hat had seriously
considered putting 
him
 in Slytherin. He could remember, as though it were
yesterday, the small voice that had spoken in his ear when he’d placed the hat
on his head a year before: 
You could be great, you know, it’s all here in your
head, and Slytherin would help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about
that. . . .
But Harry, who had already heard of Slytherin House’s reputation forturning out Dark wizards, had thought desperately, 
Not Slytherin!
 and the hat
had said, 
Oh, well, if you’re sure . . . better be Gryffindor. . . .
As they were shunted along in the throng, Colin Creevey went past.
“Hiya, Harry!”
“Hullo, Colin,” said Harry automatically.
“Harry — Harry — a boy in my class has been saying you’re —”
But Colin was so small he couldn’t fight ag  you are here, your House will be something like
your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your
House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free time in your House
common room.
“The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and
Slytherin. Each House has its own noble history and each has produced
outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs
will earn your House points, while any rule-breaking will lose House points.
At the end of the year, the House with the most points is awarded the House
Cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever House
becomes yours.
“The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest
of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can
while you are waiting.”
Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville’s cloak, which was fastened
under his left ear, and on Ron’s smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to
flatten his hair.
“I shall return when we are r aw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall
full of people craning to get a good look at him. Next second he was looking
at the black inside of the hat. He waited.
“Hmm,” said a small voice in his ear. “Difficult. Very difficult. Plenty of
courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There’s talent, oh my goodness, yes —
and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that’s interesting. . . . So where shall I
put you?”
Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, 
Not Slytherin, not
Slytherin.
“Not Slytherin, eh?” said the small voice. “Are you sure? You could be
great, you know, it’s all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the
way to greatness, no doubt about that — no? Well, if you’re sure — better be
GRYFFINDOR!”
Harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall. He took off the
hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table. He was so relieved to
have been chosen and not put in Slytherin, he hardly noticed that he was
getting the loudest cheer yet. Percy the Prefect got up and  ch a foolish story! We will return, if you
please, to 
history,
 to solid, believable, verifiable 
fact
!”
And within five minutes, the class had sunk back into its usual torpor.
“I always knew Salazar Slytherin was a twisted old loony,” Ron told Harry
and Hermione as they fought their way through the teeming corridors at the
end of the lesson to drop off their bags before dinner. “But I never knew he
started all this pure-blood stuff. I wouldn’t be in his House if you paid me.
Honestly, if the Sorting Hat had tried to put me in Slytherin, I’d’ve got the
train straight back home. . . .”
Hermione nodded fervently, but Harry didn’t say anything. His stomach
had just dropped unpleasantly.
Harry had never told Ron and Hermione that the Sorting Hat had seriously
considered putting 
him
 in Slytherin. He could remember, as though it were
yesterday, the small voice that had spoken in his ear when he’d placed the hat
on his head a year before: 
You could be great, you know, it’s all here in your
head, and Slytherin w ontinued.
“For a few years, the founders worked in harmony together, seeking out
youngsters who showed signs of magic and bringing them to the castle to be
educated. But then disagreements sprang up between them. A rift began to
grow between Slytherin and the others. Slytherin wished to be more 
selective
about the students admitted to Hogwarts. He believed that magical learning
should be kept within all-magic families. He disliked taking students ofMuggle parentage, believing them to be untrustworthy. After a while, there
was a serious argument on the subject between Slytherin and Gryffindor, and
Slytherin left the school.”
Professor Binns paused again, pursing his lips, looking like a wrinkled old
tortoise.
“Reliable historical sources tell us this much,” he said. “But these honest
facts have been obscured by the fanciful legend of the Chamber of Secrets.
The story goes that Slytherin had built a hidden chamber in the castle, of
which the other founders knew nothing.
“Slytherin, according to the legend, sea ck silver eyebrows. “And what do you think, Harry?”
“I don’t think I’m like him!” said Harry, more loudly than he’d intended. “I
mean, I’m — 
I’m in 
Gryffindor, 
I’m . . .”
But he fell silent, a lurking doubt resurfacing in his mind.
“Professor,” he started again after a moment. “The Sorting Hat told me I’d— 
I’d have done well in Slytherin. Everyone thought 
I
 was Slytherin’s heir
for a while . . . because I can speak Parseltongue. . . .”
“You can speak Parseltongue, Harry,” said Dumbledore calmly, “because
Lord Voldemort — 
who 
is
 the last remaining descendant of Salazar Slytherin
— 
can speak Parseltongue. Unless I’m much mistaken, he transferred some of
his own powers to you the night he gave you that scar. Not something he
intended to do, I’m sure. . . .”
“Voldemort put a bit of himself in 
me
?” Harry said, thunderstruck.
“It certainly seems so.”
“So I 
should 
be in Slytherin,” Harry said, looking desperately into
Dumbledore’s face. “The Sorting Hat could see Slytherin’s power in me, and
it —”
“Put rom a doorway to the right — the
rest of the school must already be here — but Professor McGonagall showed
the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in,
standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering
about nervously.
“Welcome to Hogwarts,” said Professor McGonagall. “The start-of-term
banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall,
you will be sorted into your Houses. The Sorting is a very importantceremony because, while you are here, your House will be something like

“Voldemort put a bit of himself in

?” Harry said, thunderstruck.
“It certainly seems so.”
“So I 
should 
be in Slytherin,” Harry said, looking desperately into
Dumbledore’s face. “The Sorting Hat could see Slytherin’s power in me, and
it —”
“Put you in Gryffindor,” said Dumbledore calmly. “Listen to me, Harry.
You happen to have many qualities Salazar Slytherin prized in his hand-
picked students. His own very rare gift, Parseltongue — 
resourcefulness —
determination — 
a certain disregard for rules,” he added, his mustache
quivering again. “Yet the Sorting Hat placed you in Gryffindor. You know
why that was. Think.”
“It only put me in Gryffindor,” said Harry in a defeated voice, “because I
asked not to go in Slytherin. . . .”
“Exactly,”

What potion grants good luck?,Felix Felicis,"According to the passage, Felix Felicis is the potion that grants good luck.","oom.”
“Or someone who looked like a girl or a woman,” said Harry. “Don’t
forget, there was a cauldron full of Polyjuice Potion at Hogwarts. We know
some of it got stolen. . . .”
In his mind’s eye, he watched a parade of Crabbes and Goyles prance past,
all transformed into girls.
“I think I’m going to take another swig of Felix,” said Harry, “and have a
go at the Room of Requirement again.”“That would be a complete waste of potion,” said Hermione flatly, putting
down the copy of 
Spellman’s Syllabary
 she had just taken out of her bag.
“Luck can only get you so far, Harry. The situation with Slughorn was
different; you always had the ability to persuade him, you just needed to
tweak the circumstances a bit. Luck isn’t enough to get you through a
powerful enchantment, though. Don’t go wasting the rest of that potion!
You’ll need all the luck you can get if Dumbledore takes you along with him
. . .” She dropped her voice to a whisper.
“Couldn’t we make some more?” Ron asked Harry, ignoring Hermione.
“It’d be gre d just taken out of her bag.

. . .” She dropped her voice to a whisper.
“Couldn’t we make some more?” Ron asked Harry, ignoring Hermione.
“It’d be great to have a stock of it. . . . Have a look in the book . . .”
Harry pulled his copy of 
Advanced Potion-Making
 out of his bag and
looked up Felix Felicis.
“Blimey, it’s seriously complicated,” he said, running an eye down the list
of ingredients. “And it takes six months . . . You’ve got to let it stew. . . .”
“Typical,” said Ron.
Harry was about to put his book away again when he noticed the corner of
a page folded down; turning to it, he saw the 
Sectumsempra
 spell, captioned
“For Enemies,” that he had  The potion
within was splashing about merrily; it was the color of molten gold, and large
drops were leaping like goldfish above the surface, though not a particle had
spilled.
“Oho,” said Slughorn again. Harry was sure that Slughorn had not
forgotten the potion at all, but had waited to be asked for dramatic effect.
“Yes. That. Well, 
that
 one, ladies and gentlemen, is a most curious little
potion called Felix Felicis. I take it,” he turned, smiling, to look at Hermione,
who had let out an audible gasp, “that you know what Felix Felicis does, Miss
Granger?”
“It’s liquid luck,” said Hermione excitedly. “It makes you lucky!”
The whole class seemed to sit up a little straighter. Now all Harry could see
of Malfoy was the back of his sleek blond head, because he was at last giving
Slughorn his full and undivided attention.
“Quite right, take another ten points for Gryffindor. Yes, it’s a funny little
potion, Felix Felicis,” said Slughorn. “Desperately tricky to make, and
disastrous to get wrong. However, if bre  way, please, Harry,” said Dumbledore. He raised his wand and
made complicated movements over the surface of the potion, murmuring
soundlessly. Nothing happened, except perhaps that the potion glowed a little
brighter. Harry remained silent while Dumbledore worked, but after a while
Dumbledore withdrew his wand, and Harry felt it was safe to talk again.
“You think the Horcrux is in there, sir?”
“Oh yes.” Dumbledore peered more closely into the basin. Harry saw his
face reflected, upside down, in the smooth surface of the green potion. “But
how to reach it? This potion cannot be penetrated by hand, Vanished, parted,
scooped up, or siphoned away, nor can it be Transfigured, Charmed, or
otherwise made to change its nature.”
Almost absentmindedly, Dumbledore raised his wand again, twirled it once
in midair, and then caught the crystal goblet that he had conjured out of
nowhere.
“I can only conclude that this potion is supposed to be drunk.”
“What?” said Harry. “No!”
“Yes, I think so: Only by drinking it can I emp se handle
he turned with a paw. Then he was gone.
“Severus,” said Dumbledore, turning to Snape, “you know what I must askyou to do. If you are ready . . . if you are prepared . . .”
“I am,” said Snape.
He looked slightly paler than usual, and his cold, black eyes glittered
strangely.
“Then good luck,” said Dumbledore, and he watched, with a trace of
apprehension on his face, as Snape swept wordlessly after Sirius.
It was several minutes before Dumbledore spoke again.
“I must go downstairs,” he said finally. “I must see the Diggorys. Harry —
take the rest of your potion. I will see all of you later.”
Harry slumped back against his pillows as Dumbledore disappeared.
Hermione, Ron, and Mrs. Weasley were all looking at him. None of them
spoke for a very long time.
“You’ve got to take the rest of your potion, Harry,” Mrs. Weasley said at
last. Her hand nudged the sack of gold on his bedside cabinet as she reached
for the bottle and the goblet. “You have a good long sleep. Try and think
about something else for a w e air. But no . . . their last hope was gone.
“What we need,” said Dumbledore slowly, and his light blue eyes moved
from Harry to Hermione, “is more 
time.
”
“But —” Hermione began. And then her eyes became very round. “OH!”
“Now, pay attention,” said Dumbledore, speaking very low, and very
clearly. “Sirius is locked in Professor Flitwick’s office on the seventh floor.
Thirteenth window from the right of the West Tower. If all goes well, you will
be able to save more than one innocent life tonight. But remember this, both
of you: 
You must not be seen.
 Miss Granger, you know the law — you know
what is at stake. . . . 
You — must — not — be — seen.
”
Harry didn’t have a clue what was going on. Dumbledore had turned on his
heel and looked back as he reached the door.
“I am going to lock you in. It is —” he consulted his watch, “five minutes
to midnight. Miss Granger, three turns should do it. Good luck.”
“Good luck?” Harry repeated as the door closed behind Dumbledore.
“Three turns? What’s he talking about? Wh ee him grinning.
“You know perfectly well what we’re talking about!” said Hermione
shrilly. “You spiked Ron’s juice with lucky potion at breakfast! Felix Felicis!”
“No, I didn’t,” said Harry, turning back to face them both.
“Yes you did, Harry, and that’s why everything went right, there were
Slytherin players missing and Ron saved everything!”“I didn’t put it in!” said Harry, grinning broadly. He slipped his hand inside
his jacket pocket and drew out the tiny bottle that Hermione had seen in his
hand that morning. It was full of golden potion and the cork was still tightly
sealed with wax. “I wanted Ron to think I’d done it, so I faked it when I knew
you were looking.” He looked at Ron. “You saved everything because you felt
lucky. You did it all yourself.”
He pocketed the potion again.
“There really wasn’t anything in my pumpkin juice?” Ron said, astounded.
“But the weather’s good . . . and Vaisey couldn’t play. . . . I honestly haven’t
been given lucky potion?”
Harry shook his head. Ron gaped at him for a  em concerned with potion-making. Here
and there were directions for what looked like spells that the Prince had made
up himself.
“Or herself,” said Hermione irritably, overhearing Harry pointing some of
these out to Ron in the common room on Saturday evening. “It might have
been a girl. I think the handwriting looks more like a girl’s than a boy’s.”“The Half-Blood 
Prince,
 he was called,” Harry said. “How many girls have
been Princes?”
Hermione seemed to have no answer to this. She merely scowled and
twitched her essay on 
The Principles of Rematerialization
 away from Ron,
who was trying to read it upside down.
Harry looked at his watch and hurriedly put the old copy of 
Advanced
Potion-Making
 back into his bag.
“It’s five to eight, I’d better go, I’ll be late for Dumbledore.”
“Ooooh!” gasped Hermione, looking up at once. “Good luck! We’ll wait
up, we want to hear what he teaches you!”
“Hope it goes okay,” said Ron, and the pair of them watched Harry leave
through the portrait hole.
Harry proceeded through"

“Yeah . . . I — er . . . thanks,” said Harry weakly.
“What is this thing?” said Moody, drawing the Marauder’s Map out of his
pocket and unfolding it.
“Map of Hogwarts,” said Harry, hoping Moody was going to pull him out
of the staircase soon; his leg was really hurting him.
“Merlin’s beard,” Moody whispered, staring at the map, his magical eye
going haywire. “This . . . this is some map, Potter!”
“Yeah, it’s . . . quite useful,” Harry said. His eyes were starting to water
from the pain. “Er — Professor Moody, d’you think you could help me — ?”
“What? Oh! Yes . . . yes, of course . . .”
Moody took hold of Harry’s arms and pulled; Harry’s leg came free of the
trick step, and he climbed onto the one above it. Moody was still gazing at the
map.
“Potter . . .” he said slowly, “you didn’t happen, by any chance, to see who
broke into Snape’s office, did you? On this map, I mean?”
“Er . . . yeah, I did . . .” Harry admitted. “It was Mr. Crouch.”
Moody’s magical eye whizzed over the entire surface of the map. He
l eld
out the Marauder’s Map too. “I am no longer your teacher, so I don’t feel
guilty about giving you this back as well. It’s no use to me, and I daresay you,
Ron, and Hermione will find uses for it.”
Harry took the map and grinned.
“You told me Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs would’ve wanted to
lure me out of school . . . you said they’d have thought it was funny.”
“And so we would have,” said Lupin, now reaching down to close his case.
“I have no hesitation in saying that James would have been highly
disappointed if his son had never found any of the secret passages out of the
castle.”
There was a knock on the door. Harry hastily stuffed the Marauder’s Map
and the Invisibility Cloak into his pocket.
It was Professor Dumbledore. He didn’t look surprised to see Harry there.
“Your carriage is at the gates, Remus,” he said.
“Thank you, Headmaster.”
Lupin picked up his old suitcase and the empty grindylow tank.
“Well — good-bye, Harry,” he said, smiling. “It has been a real pleasure
teaching you. I feel sur n helping him,” he said, with a furious glance at Black,
“how did you know he was here?”
“The map,” said Lupin. “The Marauder’s Map. I was in my office
examining it —”
“You know how to work it?” Harry said suspiciously.
“Of course I know how to work it,” said Lupin, waving his hand
impatiently. “I helped write it. I’m Moony — that was my friends’ nickname
for me at school.”
“You 
wrote — 
?”
“The important thing is, I was watching it carefully this evening, because I
had an idea that you, Ron, and Hermione might try and sneak out of the castle
to visit Hagrid before his hippogriff was executed. And I was right, wasn’t I?”
He had started to pace up and down, looking at them. Little patches of dust
rose at his feet.
“You might have been wearing your father’s old Cloak, Harry —”“How d’you know about the Cloak?”
“The number of times I saw James disappearing under it . . . ,” said Lupin,
waving an impatient hand again. “The point is, even if you’re wearing an
Invisibility Cloak, you still show up on the Marauder’s ning and following her master. Still breathing very
fast, Harry heard Snape walking away down the corridor; Filch handed
Moody the egg and disappeared from view too, muttering to Mrs. Norris.
“Never mind, my sweet . . . we’ll see Dumbledore in the morning . . . tell him
what Peeves was up to. . . .”
A door slammed. Harry was left staring down at Moody, who placed his
staff on the bottommost stair and started to climb laboriously toward him, a
dull 
clunk
 on every other step.“Close shave, Potter,” he muttered.
“Yeah . . . I — er . . . thanks,” said Harry weakly.
“What is this thing?” said Moody, drawing the Marauder’s Map out of his
pocket and unfolding it.
“Map of Hogwarts,” said Harry, hoping Moody was going to pull him out
of the staircase soon; his leg was really hurting him.
“Merlin’s beard,” Moody whispered, staring at the map, his magical eye
going haywire. “This . . . this is some map, Potter!”
“Yeah, it’s . . . quite useful,” Harry said. His eyes were starting to water
from the pain. “Er — Professor   master guessed that he was heading for Hogwarts. My father was going to
tell Dumbledore everything, to confess. He was going to admit that he had
smuggled me from Azkaban.
“My master sent me word of my father’s escape. He told me to stop him at
all costs. So I waited and watched. I used the map I had taken from Harry
Potter. The map that had almost ruined everything.”
“Map?” said Dumbledore quickly. “What map is this?”
“Potter’s map of Hogwarts. Potter saw me on it. Potter saw me stealing
more ingredients for the Polyjuice Potion from Snape’s office one night. He
thought I was my father. We have the same first name. I took the map from
Potter that night. I told him my father hated Dark wizards. Potter believed my
father was after Snape.
“For a week I waited for my father to arrive at Hogwarts. At last, one
evening, the map showed my father entering the grounds. I pulled on my
Invisibility Cloak and went down to meet him. He was walking around the
edge of the forest. Then Potter came, and Krum. I waited. I co no
interruption. “Come on, last time we went you didn’t see anything. You
haven’t even been inside Zonko’s yet!”
Harry looked around to check that Hermione was well out of earshot.
“Okay,” he said. “But I’m taking the Invisibility Cloak this time.”
On Saturday morning, Harry packed his Invisibility Cloak in his bag, slipped
the Marauder’s Map into his pocket, and went down to breakfast with
everyone else. Hermione kept shooting suspicious looks down the table at
him, but he avoided her eye and was careful to let her see him walking back
up the marble staircase in the entrance hall as everybody else proceeded to the
front doors.
“’Bye!” Harry called to Ron. “See you when you get back!”
Ron grinned and winked.Harry hurried up to the third floor, slipping the Marauder’s Map out of his
pocket as he went. Crouching behind the one-eyed witch, he smoothed it out.
A tiny dot was moving in his direction. Harry squinted at it. The minuscule
writing next to it read 
Neville Longbottom.
Harry quickly pulled out his wand, hed up the stairs
and into his dormitory, where he flung open his trunk and pulled out the
Marauder’s Map and a pair of balled-up socks. Then he sped back down the
stairs and into the common room, skidding to a halt where Ron and Hermione
sat, looking stunned.
“I’ve got to be quick,” Harry panted. “Dumbledore thinks I’m getting my
Invisibility Cloak. Listen. . . .”
Quickly he told them where he was going and why. He did not pause either
for Hermione’s gasps of horror or for Ron’s hasty questions; they could work
out the finer details for themselves later.
“. . . so you see what this means?” Harry finished at a gallop. “Dumbledorewon’t be here tonight, so Malfoy’s going to have another clear shot at
whatever he’s up to. 
No, listen to me!
” he hissed angrily, as both Ron and
Hermione showed every sign of interrupting. “I know it was Malfoy
celebrating in the Room of Requirement. Here —” 
He shoved the Marauder’s
Map into Hermione’s hands. “You’ve got to watch him and you’ve got to
watch Snape too. Use anyone e ” said Harry. He dropped his voice so that none of the
sixth years could hear him and told them all about the Marauder’s Map.
“How come Fred and George never gave it to 
me
!”
 
said Ron, outraged.
“I’m their brother!”
“But Harry isn’t going to keep it!” said Hermione, as though the idea were
ludicrous. “He’s going to hand it in to Professor McGonagall, aren’t you,
Harry?”
“No, I’m not!” said Harry.
“Are you mad?” said Ron, goggling at Hermione. “Hand in something that
good?”
“If I hand it in, I’ll have to say where I got it! Filch would know Fred and
George had nicked it!”
“But what about Sirius Black?” Hermione hissed. “He could be using one
of the passages on that map to get into the castle! The teachers have got to
know!”
“He can’t be getting in through a passage,” said Harry quickly. “There are
seven secret tunnels on the map, right? Fred and George reckon Filch already
knows about four of them. And of the other three — one of them’s caved in,
so no one can get through it. One of them’s got the Whomping "

taste it. The Hogwarts champion next . . .
And the Goblet of Fire turned red once more; sparks showered out of it; the
tongue of flame shot high into the air, and from its tip Dumbledore pulled the
third piece of parchment.
“The Hogwarts champion,” he called, “is Cedric Diggory!”
“No!” said Ron loudly, but nobody heard him except Harry; the uproar
from the next table was too great. Every single Hufflepuff had jumped to his
or her feet, screaming and stamping, as Cedric made his way past them,
grinning broadly, and headed off toward the chamber behind the teachers’
table. Indeed, the applause for Cedric went on so long that it was some time
before Dumbledore could make himself heard again.
“Excellent!” Dumbledore called happily as at last the tumult died down.
“Well, we now have our three champions. I am sure I can count upon all of
you, including the remaining students from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang, to
give your champions every ounce of support you can muster. By cheering
your champion on, you wil ds of years ago.
“There have been several attempts over the centuries to reinstate the
tournament,” Dumbledore continued, “none of which has been very
successful. However, our own Departments of International Magical
Cooperation and Magical Games and Sports have decided the time is ripe for
another attempt. We have worked hard over the summer to ensure that this
time, no champion will find himself or herself in mortal danger.
“The Heads of Beauxbatons and Durmstrang will be arriving with their
shortlisted contenders in October, and the selection of the three champions
will take place at Halloween. An impartial judge will decide which students
are most worthy to compete for the Triwizard Cup, the glory of their school,
and a thousand Galleons personal prize money.”
“I’m going for it!” Fred Weasley hissed down the table, his face lit with
enthusiasm at the prospect of such glory and riches. He was not the only
person who seemed to be visualizing himself as the Hogwarts champion. At
every House table, Harry coul oke. Nearly everyone laughed, and Dumbledore chuckled appreciatively.
“I am 
not
 joking, Mr. Weasley,” he said, “though now that you mention it, I
did hear an excellent one over the summer about a troll, a hag, and a
leprechaun who all go into a bar . . .”
Professor McGonagall cleared her throat loudly.
“Er — but maybe this is not the time . . . no . . .” said Dumbledore, “where
was I? Ah yes, the Triwizard Tournament . . . well, some of you will not know
what this tournament involves, so I hope those who 
do
 know will forgive me
for giving a short explanation, and allow their attention to wander freely.
“The Triwizard Tournament was first established some seven hundred years
ago as a friendly competition between the three largest European schools of
wizardry: Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, and Durmstrang. A champion was selected
to represent each school, and the three champions competed in three magical
tasks. The schools took it in turns to host the tournament once every five
years, and it was generally agreed to nde hair, and swept
up between the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables.
“Oh look, they’re all disappointed,” Hermione said over the noise, nodding
toward the remainder of the Beauxbatons party. “Disappointed” was a bit of
an understatement, Harry thought. Two of the girls who had not been selected
had dissolved into tears and were sobbing with their heads on their arms.
When Fleur Delacour too had vanished into the side chamber, silence fell
again, but this time it was a silence so stiff with excitement you could almost
taste it. The Hogwarts champion next . . .
And the Goblet of Fire turned red once more; sparks showered out of it; the
tongue of flame shot high into the air, and from its tip Dumbledore pulled the
third piece of parchment.
“The Hogwarts champion,” he called, “is Cedric Diggory!”
“No!” said Ron loudly, but nobody heard him except Harry; the uproar
from the next table was too great. Every single Hufflepuff had jumped to his
or her feet, screaming and stamping, as Cedric made his way past them,
grin arkaroff, so loudly that everyone could hear
him, even over all the applause. “Knew you had it in you!”
The clapping and chatting died down. Now everyone’s attention was
focused again on the goblet, which, seconds later, turned red once more. A
second piece of parchment shot out of it, propelled by the flames.“The champion for Beauxbatons,” said Dumbledore, “is Fleur Delacour!”
“It’s her, Ron!” Harry shouted as the girl who so resembled a veela got
gracefully to her feet, shook back her sheet of silvery blonde hair, and swept
up between the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables.
“Oh look, they’re all disappointed,” Hermione said over the noise, nodding
toward the remainder of the Beauxbatons party. “Disappointed” was a bit of
an understatement, Harry thought. Two of the girls who had not been selected
had dissolved into tears and were sobbing with their heads on their arms.
When Fleur Delacour too had vanished into the side chamber, silence fell
again, but this time it was a silence so stiff with excitement you cou pushed their way
through the chattering crowd toward the staircase.
“He’s not an idiot. You just don’t like him because he beat Gryffindor at
Quidditch,” said Hermione. “I’ve heard he’s a really good student — 
and
 he’s
a prefect.”
She spoke as though this settled the matter.
“You only like him because he’s 
handsome,
” said Ron scathingly.
“Excuse me, I don’t like people just because they’re handsome!” said
Hermione indignantly.
Ron gave a loud false cough, which sounded oddly like 
“Lockhart!”
The appearance of the sign in the entrance hall had a marked effect upon
the inhabitants of the castle. During the following week, there seemed to be
only one topic of conversation, no matter where Harry went: the Triwizard
Tournament. Rumors were flying from student to student like highly
contagious germs: who was going to try for Hogwarts champion, what the
tournament would involve, how the students from Beauxbatons and
Durmstrang differed from themselves.
Harry noticed too that the castle seemed to be undergoing a ng them Hogwarts champion.” His light blueeyes twinkled as they flickered over Fred’s and George’s mutinous faces. “I
therefore beg you not to waste your time submitting yourself if you are under
seventeen.
“The delegations from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang will be arriving in
October and remaining with us for the greater part of this year. I know that
you will all extend every courtesy to our foreign guests while they are with
us, and will give your whole-hearted support to the Hogwarts champion when
he or she is selected. And now, it is late, and I know how important it is to
you all to be alert and rested as you enter your lessons tomorrow morning.
Bedtime! Chop chop!”
Dumbledore sat down again and turned to talk to Mad-Eye Moody. There
was a great scraping and banging as all the students got to their feet and
swarmed toward the double doors into the entrance hall.
“They can’t do that!” said George Weasley, who had not joined the crowd
moving toward the door, but was standing up and glaring at Dumbledore.
“W 
“Whose owl am I going to use?” Harry said as they climbed the stairs. “Hetold me not to use Hedwig again.”
“Ask Ron if you can borrow —”
“I’m not asking Ron for anything,” Harry said flatly.
“Well, borrow one of the school owls, then, anyone can use them,” said
Hermione.
They went up to the Owlery. Hermione gave Harry a piece of parchment, a
quill, and a bottle of ink, then strolled around the long lines of perches,
looking at all the different owls, while Harry sat down against a wall and
wrote his letter.
Dear Sirius,
You told me to keep you posted on what’s happening at Hogwarts,
so here goes — 
I don’t know if you’ve heard, but the Triwizard
Tournament’s happening this year and on Saturday night I got
picked as a fourth champion. I don’t know who put my name in the
Goblet of Fire, because I didn’t. The other Hogwarts champion is
Cedric Diggory, from Hufflepuff.
He paused at this point, thinking. He had an urge to say something about
the large weight of anxiety that seemed to have settled inside his chest"
What is Voldemort's real name?,Tom Riddle,"According to the text, Voldemort's real name is Tom Marvolo Riddle.","zard
of all time? How did 
you
 escape with nothing but a scar, while Lord
Voldemort’s powers were destroyed?”
There was an odd red gleam in his hungry eyes now.
“Why do you care how I escaped?” said Harry slowly. “Voldemort was
after your time. . . .”
“Voldemort,” said Riddle softly, “is my past, present, and future, Harry
Potter. . . .”
He pulled Harry’s wand from his pocket and began to trace it through the
air, writing three shimmering words:
TOM MARVOLO RIDDLE
Then he waved the wand once, and the letters of his name rearranged
themselves:
I AM LORD VOLDEMORT
“You see?” he whispered. “It was a name I was already using at Hogwarts,
to my most intimate friends only, of course. You think I was going to use my
filthy Muggle father’s name forever? I, in whose veins runs the blood of
Salazar Slytherin himself, through my mother’s side? I, keep the name of a
foul, common Muggle, who abandoned me even before I was born, just
because he found out his wife was a witch? No, Harry — I fashioned myself a
new name, a n  in the forest.
Harry couldn’t sit down. He paced up and down in front of the fire. He was
still shaking.
“Snape wants the Stone for Voldemort . . . and Voldemort’s waiting in the
forest . . . and all this time we thought Snape just wanted to get rich. . . .”
“Stop saying the name!” said Ron in a terrified whisper, as if he thought
Voldemort could hear them.
Harry wasn’t listening.
“Firenze saved me, but he shouldn’t have done so. . . . Bane was furious . . .
he was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to
happen. . . . They must show that Voldemort’s coming back. . . . Bane thinks
Firenze should have let Voldemort kill me. . . . I suppose that’s written in the
stars as well.”
“Will you stop saying the name!”
 Ron hissed.
“So all I’ve got to wait for now is Snape to steal the Stone,” Harry went on
feverishly, “then Voldemort will be able to come and finish me off. . . . Well, I
suppose Bane’ll be happy.”
Hermione looked very frightened, but she had a word of comfort.
“Harry, everyone sa rs of his name rearranged
themselves:
I AM LORD VOLDEMORT
“You see?” he whispered. “It was a name I was already using at Hogwarts,
to my most intimate friends only, of course. You think I was going to use my
filthy Muggle father’s name forever? I, in whose veins runs the blood of
Salazar Slytherin himself, through my mother’s side? I, keep the name of a
foul, common Muggle, who abandoned me even before I was born, just
because he found out his wife was a witch? No, Harry — I fashioned myself a
new name, a name I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak,when I had become the greatest sorcerer in the world!”
Harry’s brain seemed to have jammed. He stared numbly at Riddle, at the
orphaned boy who had grown up to murder Harry’s own parents, and so many
others. . . . At last he forced himself to speak.
“You’re not,” he said, his quiet voice full of hatred.
“Not what?” snapped Riddle.
“Not the greatest sorcerer in the world,” said Harry, breathing fast. “Sorry
to disappoint you and all that, but the grea aving handed Voldemort a
goblet of wine and poured one for himself, he returned to the seat behind his
desk.
“So, Tom . . . to what do I owe the pleasure?”Voldemort did not answer at once, but merely sipped his wine.
“They do not call me ‘Tom’ anymore,” he said. “These days, I am known
as —”
“I know what you are known as,” said Dumbledore, smiling pleasantly.
“But to me, I’m afraid, you will always be Tom Riddle. It is one of the
irritating things about old teachers. I am afraid that they never quite forget
their charges’ youthful beginnings.”
He raised his glass as though toasting Voldemort, whose face remained
expressionless. Nevertheless, Harry felt the atmosphere in the room change
subtly: Dumbledore’s refusal to use Voldemort’s chosen name was a refusal to
allow Voldemort to dictate the terms of the meeting, and Harry could tell that
Voldemort took it as such.
“I am surprised you have remained here so long,” said Voldemort after a
short pause. “I always wondered why a wizard such as yourself never wished s?” said Harry.“Exactly . . . she disappeared in Albania, and that’s definitely where
Voldemort was rumored to be last . . . and she would have known the
Triwizard Tournament was coming up, wouldn’t she?”
“Yeah, but . . . it’s not very likely she’d have walked straight into
Voldemort, is it?” said Harry.
“Listen, I knew Bertha Jorkins,” said Sirius grimly. “She was at Hogwarts
when I was, a few years above your dad and me. And she was an idiot. Very
nosy, but no brains, none at all. It’s not a good combination, Harry. I’d say
she’d be very easy to lure into a trap.”
“So . . . so Voldemort could have found out about the tournament?” said
Harry. “Is that what you mean? You think Karkaroff might be here on his
orders?”
“I don’t know,” said Sirius slowly, “I just don’t know . . . Karkaroff doesn’t
strike me as the type who’d go back to Voldemort unless he knew Voldemort
was powerful enough to protect him. But whoever put your name in that
goblet did it for a reason, and I can’t help thinking the tournament would  said. Was it — was she making a
real prediction?”
Dumbledore looked mildly impressed.
“Do you know, Harry, I think she might have been,” he said thoughtfully.
“Who’d have thought it? That brings her total of real predictions up to two. I
should offer her a pay raise. . . .”
“But —” Harry looked at him, aghast. How could Dumbledore take this so
calmly?
“But — I stopped Sirius and Professor Lupin from killing Pettigrew! That
makes it my fault if Voldemort comes back!”
“It does not,” said Dumbledore quietly. “Hasn’t your experience with the
Time-Turner taught you anything, Harry? The consequences of our actions
are always so complicated, so diverse, that predicting the future is a verydifficult business indeed. . . . Professor Trelawney, bless her, is living proof of
that. . . . You did a very noble thing, in saving Pettigrew’s life.”
“But if he helps Voldemort back to power — !”
“Pettigrew owes his life to you. You have sent Voldemort a deputy who is
in your debt. When one wizard saves another wizard’s life, it 
come a time when Lord Voldemort will seem to fear for the life of his snake.”
“For Nagini?” Snape looked astonished.
“Precisely. If there comes a time when Lord Voldemort stops sending that
snake forth to do his bidding, but keeps it safe beside him under magicalprotection, then, I think, it will be safe to tell Harry.”
“Tell him what?”
Dumbledore took a deep breath and closed his eyes.
“Tell him that on the night Lord Voldemort tried to kill him, when Lily cast
her own life between them as a shield, the Killing Curse rebounded upon
Lord Voldemort, and a fragment of Voldemort’s soul was blasted apart from
the whole, and latched itself onto the only living soul left in that collapsing
building. Part of Lord Voldemort lives inside Harry, and it is that which gives
him the power of speech with snakes, and a connection with Lord
Voldemort’s mind that he has never understood. And while that fragment of
soul, unmissed by Voldemort, remains attached to and protected by Harry,
Lord Voldemort cannot die.”
Harry seeme  eleven years I have
been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name: 
Voldemort.
”
Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two
lemon drops, seemed not to notice. “It all gets so confusing if we keep saying
‘You-Know-Who.’ I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying
Voldemort’s name.”
“I know you haven’t,” said Professor McGonagall, sounding half
exasperated, half admiring. “But you’re different. Everyone knows you’re the
only one You-Know- oh, all right, 
Voldemort,
 was frightened of.”
“You flatter me,” said Dumbledore calmly. “Voldemort had powers I will
never have.”
“Only because you’re too — well — 
noble
 to use them.”
“It’s lucky it’s dark. I haven’t blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told
me she liked my new earmuffs.”
Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said, “The
owls are nothing next to the 
rumors
 that are flying around. You know what
everyone’s saying? About why he’s disappeared? About what finally stopped
him?”
It seemed "

The passage only mentions that Harry's wand ""spun in his hand and found"" Voldemort and shot a spell at him, but it doesn't describe the spell itself.","s broken at last by Mrs. Weasley.
“Where’s Hedwig, Harry?” she said coaxingly. “We can put her up with
Pigwidgeon and give her something to eat.”
His insides clenched like a fist. He could not tell her the truth. He drank the
last of his firewhisky to avoid answering.
“Wait till it gets out yeh did it again, Harry,” said Hagrid. “Escaped him,
fought him off when he was right on top of yeh!”
“It wasn’t me,” said Harry flatly. “It was my wand. My wand acted of its
own accord.”
After a few moments, Hermione said gently, “But that’s impossible, Harry.
You mean that you did magic without meaning to; you reacted instinctively.”
“No,” said Harry. “The bike was falling, I couldn’t have told you where
Voldemort was, but my wand spun in my hand and found him and shot a spell
at him, and it wasn’t even a spell I recognized. I’ve never made gold flames
appear before.”
“Often,” said Mr. Weasley, “when you’re in a pressured situation you can

they’re trai id gently, “But that’s impossible, Harry.

“No,” said Harry. “The bike was falling, I couldn’t have told you where

“Often,” said Mr. Weasley, “when you’re in a pressured situation you can
produce magic you never dreamed of. Small children often find, before
they’re trained —”
“It wasn’t like that,” said Harry through gritted teeth. His scar was burning:
He felt angry and frustrated; he hated the idea that they were all imagining
him to have power to match Voldemort’s.
No one said anything. He knew that they did not believe him. Now that he
came to think of it, he had never heard of a wand performing magic on its
own before.His scar seared with pain; it was all he could do not to moan aloud.
Muttering about fresh air, he set down his glass and left the room.
As he crossed  lt a creeping chill behind him that could mean only
one thing. There was more than one.
“DUDLEY, KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT! WHATEVER YOU DO,
KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT! Wand!” Harry muttered frantically, his hands
flying over the ground like spiders. “Where’s — wand — come on —
Lumos!
”
He said the spell automatically, desperate for light to help him in his search
— and to his disbelieving relief, light flared inches from his right hand — the
wand-tip had ignited. Harry snatched it up, scrambled to his feet, and turned
around.
His stomach turned over.
A towering, hooded figure was gliding smoothly toward him, hovering over
the ground, no feet or face visible beneath its robes, sucking on the night as it
came.Stumbling backward, Harry raised his wand.
“Expecto Patronum!”
A silvery wisp of vapor shot from the tip of the wand and the dementor
slowed, but the spell hadn’t worked properly; tripping over his feet, Harry
retreated farther as the dementor bore down upon him, panic fogging his brain
— 
concentrate 
—
A pair of g , Tonks, and Kingsley.
Malfoy turned and raised his wand, but Tonks had already sent a Stunning
Spell right at him. Harry did not wait to see whether it had made contact, but
dived off the dais out of the way. The Death Eaters were completely distracted
by the appearance of the members of the Order, who were now raining spells
down upon them as they jumped from step to step toward the sunken floor:
Through the darting bodies, the flashes of light, Harry could see Neville
crawling along. He dodged another jet of red light and flung himself flat on
the ground to reach Neville.
“Are you okay?” he yelled, as another spell soared inches over their heads.
“Yes,” said Neville, trying to pull himself up.
“And Ron?”
“I dink he’s all right — he was still fighding the brain when I left —”
The stone floor between them exploded as a spell hit it, leaving a crater
right where Neville’s hand had been seconds before. Both scrambled away
from the spot, then a thick arm came out of nowhere, seized Harry around theneck and pull arry. “They set up that spell to tell
them we’d come. I reckon they’ve done something to keep us here, trap us
—”
“What about dementors?” called another Death Eater. “Let ’em have free
rein, they’d find him quick enough!”
“The Dark Lord wants Potter dead by no hand but his —”
“— an’ dementors won’t kill him! The Dark Lord wants Potter’s life, not
his soul. He’ll be easier to kill if he’s been Kissed first!”
There were noises of agreement. Dread filled Harry: To repel dementors
they would have to produce Patronuses, which would give them away
immediately.
“We’re going to have to try to Disapparate, Harry!” Hermione whispered.
Even as she said it, he felt the unnatural cold begin to steal over the street.
Light was sucked from the environment right up to the stars, which vanished.
In the pitch-blackness, he felt Hermione take hold of his arm and together,
they turned on the spot.
The air through which they needed to move seemed to have become solid:They could not Disapparate; the Death Eaters had cast their cha  a hex that caused toenails to grow alarmingly fast (he had
tried this on Crabbe in the corridor, with very entertaining results); a jinx that
glued the tongue to the roof of the mouth (which he had twice used, to general
applause, on an unsuspecting Argus Filch); and, perhaps most useful of all,
Muffliato,
 a spell that filled the ears of anyone nearby with an unidentifiable
buzzing, so that lengthy conversations could be held in class without being
overheard. The only person who did not find these charms amusing was
Hermione, who maintained a rigidly disapproving expression throughout and
refused to talk at all if Harry had used the 
Muffliato
 spell on anyone in the
vicinity.
Sitting up in bed, Harry turned the book sideways so as to examine more
closely the scribbled instructions for a spell that seemed to have caused the
Prince some trouble. There were many crossings-out and alterations, but
finally, crammed into a corner of the page, the scribble:
Levicorpus (nvbl)
While the wind and sleet pounded relen one backed
as quickly as possible down the nearest side street, and the Death Eaters
missed them by inches. They waited in the darkness, listening to the footsteps
running up and down, beams of light flying along the street from the Death
Eaters’ searching wands.
“Let’s just leave!” Hermione whispered. “Disapparate now!”
“Great idea,” said Ron, but before Harry could reply a Death Eater shouted,
“We know you’re here, Potter, and there’s no getting away! We’ll find
you!”
“They were ready for us,” whispered Harry. “They set up that spell to tell
them we’d come. I reckon they’ve done something to keep us here, trap us
—”
“What about dementors?” called another Death Eater. “Let ’em have free
rein, they’d find him quick enough!”
“The Dark Lord wants Potter dead by no hand but his —”
“— an’ dementors won’t kill him! The Dark Lord wants Potter’s life, not
his soul. He’ll be easier to kill if he’s been Kissed first!”
There were noises of agreement. Dread filled Harry: To repel dementors
they would have to produce Pat e could retort,
“you think that exists too?”
“Oh, well, in that case there is endless evidence,” said Xenophilius. “The
Elder Wand is the Hallow that is most easily traced, because of the way in
which it passes from hand to hand.”
“Which is what?” asked Harry.
“Which is that the possessor of the wand must capture it from its previous
owner, if he is to be truly master of it,” said Xenophilius. “Surely you have
heard of the way the wand came to Egbert the Egregious, after his slaughter
of Emeric the Evil? Of how Godelot died in his own cellar after his son,
Hereward, took the wand from him? Of the dreadful Loxias, who took the
wand from Barnabas Deverill, whom he had killed? The bloody trail of the
Elder Wand is splattered across the pages of Wizarding history.”
Harry glanced at Hermione. She was frowning at Xenophilius, but she did
not contradict him.
“So where do you think the Elder Wand is now?” asked Ron.
“Alas, who knows?” said Xenophilius, as he gazed out of the window.
“Who knows where the Elder Wand li"

spotted the hanging cat. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood alone, in the middle
of the corridor, as silence fell among the mass of students pressing forward to
see the grisly sight.
Then someone shouted through the quiet.
“Enemies of the Heir, beware! You’ll be next, Mudbloods!”
It was Draco Malfoy. He had pushed to the front of the crowd, his cold eyes
alive, his usually bloodless face flushed, as he grinned at the sight of the
hanging, immobile cat.W

hat’s going on here? What’s going on?”
Attracted no doubt by Malfoy’s shout, Argus Filch came
shouldering his way through the crowd. Then he saw Mrs. Norris and fell
back, clutching his face in horror.
“My cat! My cat! What’s happened to Mrs. Norris?” he shrieked.
And his popping eyes fell on Harry.
“You!”
 he screeched. “
You!
 You’ve murdered my cat! You’ve killed her!
I’ll kill you! I’ll —”
“Argus!”
Dumbledore had arrived on the scene, followed by a number of other
teachers. In seconds, he had swept past Harry, Ron, ssaging his head.
“What 
was
 that?”
“It was either a very big cat or quite a small tiger,” said Harry.
“Where’s Hermione?”
“Probably getting her owl —”
They made their way back up the crowded street to the Magical Menagerie.
As they reached it, Hermione came out, but she wasn’t carrying an owl. Her
arms were clamped tightly around the enormous ginger cat.
“You 
bought
 that monster?” said Ron, his mouth hanging open.
“He’s 
gorgeous,
 isn’t he?” said Hermione, glowing.
That was a matter of opinion, thought Harry. The cat’s ginger fur was thick
and fluffy, but it was definitely a bit bowlegged and its face looked grumpy
and oddly squashed, as though it had run headlong into a brick wall. Now that
Scabbers was out of sight, however, the cat was purring contentedly in
Hermione’s arms.
“Hermione, that thing nearly scalped me!” said Ron.
“He didn’t mean to, did you, Crookshanks?” said Hermione.
“And what about Scabbers?” said Ron, pointing at the lump in his chest
pocket. “He needs rest and relaxation! How’s he g  the house. He got into his car and
backed out of number four’s drive.
It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something
peculiar — a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn’t realize what
he had seen — then he jerked his head around to look again. There was a
tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn’t a map in
sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the
light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley
drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It
was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive — no, 
looking
 at the sign;
cats couldn’t read maps 
or
 signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and
put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing
except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.
But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something
else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic  drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on
the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a
statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didn’t
so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two
owls swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved
at all.
A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so
suddenly and silently you’d have thought he’d just popped out of the ground.
The cat’s tail twitched and its eyes narrowed.Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was tall, thin,
and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both
long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak
that swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were
light, bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was very
long and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. This man’s
name was A The cat’s tail twitched and its eyes narrowed.Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was tall, thin,

name was Albus Dumbledore.
Albus Dumbledore didn’t seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street
where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He was busy
rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But he did seem to realize he
was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still
staring at him from the other end of the street. For some reason, the sight of
the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and muttered, “I should have
known.”

He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It seemed to be a
silver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it.
The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. He clicked it again — the
next lamp flickered into darkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer,
until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the
distance, which were the eyes of the cat watching him. If anyone looked out
of their window now, even beady-eyed Mrs. Dursley, they wouldn’t be able to
see anyt rs of his name rearranged
themselves:
I AM LORD VOLDEMORT
“You see?” he whispered. “It was a name I was already using at Hogwarts,
to my most intimate friends only, of course. You think I was going to use my
filthy Muggle father’s name forever? I, in whose veins runs the blood of
Salazar Slytherin himself, through my mother’s side? I, keep the name of a
foul, common Muggle, who abandoned me even before I was born, just
because he found out his wife was a witch? No, Harry — I fashioned myself a
new name, a name I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak,when I had become the greatest sorcerer in the world!”
Harry’s brain seemed to have jammed. He stared numbly at Riddle, at the
orphaned boy who had grown up to murder Harry’s own parents, and so many
others. . . . At last he forced himself to speak.
“You’re not,” he said, his quiet voice full of hatred.
“Not what?” snapped Riddle.
“Not the greatest sorcerer in the world,” said Harry, breathing fast. “Sorry
to disappoint you and all that, but the grea but Mr. Dursley
lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last, comforting thought before
he fell asleep was that even if the Potters 
were
 involved, there was no reason
for them to come near him and Mrs. Dursley. The Potters knew very well
what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind. . . . He couldn’t see
how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on —

them

How very wrong he was.

Hermione had already jumped. She landed on Harry’s other side.
“We must be miles under the school,” she said.
“Lucky this plant thing’s here, really,” said Ron.
“Lucky!”
 shrieked Hermione. “Look at you both!”
She leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. She had to struggle
because the moment she had landed, the plant had started to twist snakelike
tendrils around her ankles. As for Harry and Ron, their legs had already been
bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing.
Hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on
her. Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off
them, but the more they strained against it, the tighter and faster the plant
wound around them.
“Stop moving!” Hermione ordered them. “I know what this is — it’s
Devil’s Snare!”
“Oh, I’m so glad we know what it’s called, that’s a great help,” snarled
Ron, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck.

curled around his chest.
“Devil’s Snare, Devil’s Snare . . . what did Professor Sprout say? — it likes
the dark and the damp —”
“So light a fire!” Harry choked.
“Yes — of course — but there’s no wood!” Hermione cried, wringing her
hands.
“HAVE YOU GONE MAD?” Ron bellowed. “ARE YOU A WITCH OR
NOT?”“Oh, right!” said Hermione, and she whipped out her wand, waved it,
muttered something, a oke. Nearly everyone laughed, and Dumbledore chuckled appreciatively.

to represent each school, and the three champions competed in three magical
tasks. The schools took it in turns to host the tournament once every five
years, and it was generally agreed to muffled sort of thump he landed on something soft.
He sat up and felt around, his eyes not used to the gloom. It felt as though he
was sitting on some sort of plant.
“It’s okay!” he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp, which was
the open trapdoor, “it’s a soft landing, you can jump!”
Ron followed right away. He landed, sprawled next to Harry.
“What’s this stuff?” were his first words.“Dunno, some sort of plant thing. I suppose it’s here to break the fall. Come
on, Hermione!”
The distant music stopped. There was a loud bark from the dog, but
Hermione had already jumped. She landed on Harry’s other side.

“Slow, aren’t you?”
He had never seen Moaning Myrtle so cheerful, apart from the day when a
dose of Polyjuice Potion had given Hermione the hairy face and tail of a cat.
Harry stared around the bathroom, thinking . . . if the voices could only be
heard underwater, then it made sense for them to belong to underwater
creatures. He ran this theory past Myrtle, who smirked at him.
“Well, that’s what Diggory thought,” she said. “He lay there talking to
himself for ages about it. Ages and ages . . . nearly all the bubbles had
gone. . . .”“Underwater . . .” Harry said slowly. “Myrtle . . . what lives in the lake,
apart from the giant squid?”
“Oh all sorts,” she said. “I sometimes go down there . . . sometimes don’t
have any choice, if someone flushes my toilet when I’m not expecting it. . . .”

Too late, it’s gone, it won’t come back.”
Harry let himself float back upward and broke the bubbly surface, shaking
his hair out of his eyes.
“Hear it?” said Myrtle.
“Yeah . . . ‘Come seek us where our voices sound . . .’ and if I need
persuading . . . hang on, I need to listen again. . . .”
He sank back beneath the water. It took three more underwater renditions
of the egg’s song before Harry had it memorized; then he trod water for a
while, thinking hard, while Myrtle sat and watched him.

whom were still gazing transfixed at Mad-Eye Moody, “we are to have the
honor of hosting a very exciting event over the coming months, an event that
has not been held for over a century. It is my very great pleasure to inform
you that the Triwizard Tournament will be taking place at Hogwarts this
year.”

The tension that had filled the Hall ever since Moody’s arrival suddenly
broke. Nearly everyone laughed, and Dumbledore chuckled appreciatively.

is, the death toll mounted so high that the tournament was discontinued.”
“Death toll?”

“Hagrid, he killed . . .”
“Killed?” said Hagrid loudly, staring down at Harry. “Snape killed?
What’re yeh on abou’, Harry?”
“Dumbledore,” said Harry. “Snape killed . . . Dumbledore.”
Hagrid simply looked at him, the little of his face that could be seen
completely blank, uncomprehending.
“Dumbledore wha’, Harry?”
“He’s dead. Snape killed him. . . .”
“Don’ say that,” said Hagrid roughly. “Snape kill Dumbledore — don’ be
stupid, Harry. Wha’s made yeh say tha’?”
“I saw it happen.”
“Yeh couldn’ have.”
“I saw it, Hagrid.”
Hagrid shook his head; his expression was disbelieving but sympathetic,
and Harry knew that Hagrid thought he had sustained a blow to the head, that
he was confused, perhaps by the aftereffects of a jinx. . . .
“What musta happened was, Dumbledore musta told Snape ter go with
them Death Eaters,” Hagrid said confidently. “I suppose he’s gotta keep his
cover. Look, let’s get yeh back up ter the school. Come on, Harry. . . .”
Harry did not attempt  n his stomach at the sound of the name. In the
silence and the stillness, horror rose inside him.
“Hagrid . . .”
“I was bindin’ up a couple o’ bowtruckle legs when I heard ’em comin’,”
said Hagrid sadly, still staring at his wrecked cabin. “They’ll’ve bin burnt ter
twigs, poor little things. . . .”

“But what happened, Harry? I jus’ saw them Death Eaters runnin’ down
from the castle, but what the ruddy hell was Snape doin’ with ’em? Where’s

“Don’ say that,” said Hagrid roughly. “Snape kill Dumbledore — don’ be

“He is simply Stunned, Winky,” said Dumbledore. “Step aside, please.
Severus, you have the potion?”
Snape handed Dumbledore a small glass bottle of completely clear liquid:
the Veritaserum with which he had threatened Harry in class. Dumbledore got
up, bent over the man on the floor, and pulled him into a sitting position
against the wall beneath the Foe-Glass, in which the reflections of
Dumbledore, Snape, and McGonagall were still glaring down upon them all.
Winky remained on her knees, trembling, her hands over her face.
Dumbledore forced the man’s mouth open and poured three drops inside it.
Then he pointed his wand at the man’s chest and said, 
“Rennervate.”
Crouch’s son opened his eyes. His face was slack, his gaze unfocused.
Dumbledore knelt before him, so that their faces were level.
“Can you hear me?” Dumbledore asked quietly.
The man’s eyelids flickered.
“Yes,” he muttered.
“I would like you to tell us,” said Dumbledore softly, “how you came to be
here. Ho  the corridor. Snape had returned
with Winky at his heels. Professor McGonagall was right behind them.
“Crouch!” Snape said, stopping dead in the doorway. “Barty Crouch!”
“Good heavens,” said Professor McGonagall, stopping dead and staring
down at the man on the floor.
Filthy, disheveled, Winky peered around Snape’s legs. Her mouth opened
wide and she let out a piercing shriek.
“Master Barty, Master Barty, what is you doing here?”She flung herself forward onto the young man’s chest.
“You is killed him! You is killed him! You is killed Master’s son!”
“He is simply Stunned, Winky,” said Dumbledore. “Step aside, please.
Severus, you have the potion?”
Snape handed Dumbledore a small glass bottle of completely clear liquid:

Win uld not hurt
Potter; my master needed him. Potter ran to get Dumbledore. I Stunned Krum.
I killed my father.”
“Noooo!”
 wailed Winky. “Master Barty, Master Barty, what is you
saying?”
“You killed your father,” Dumbledore said, in the same soft voice. “Whatdid you do with the body?”
“Carried it into the forest. Covered it with the Invisibility Cloak. I had the
map with me. I watched Potter run into the castle. He met Snape. Dumbledore
joined them. I watched Potter bringing Dumbledore out of the castle. I walked
back out of the forest, doubled around behind them, went to meet them. I told
Dumbledore Snape had told me where to come.
“Dumbledore told me to go and look for my father. I went back to my
father’s body. Watched the map. When everyone was gone, I Transfigured my
father’s body. He became a bone . . . I buried it, while wearing the Invisibility
Cloak, in the freshly dug earth in front of Hagrid’s cabin.”
There was complete silence now, except for Winky’s continued sobs. Then
Dumbledore said, “And tonight ou
were about to kill him like you killed my parents!”
“No,” said Lupin, “Harry —”“And now you’ve come to finish him off!”
“Yes, I have,” said Black, with an evil look at Scabbers.
“Then I should’ve let Snape take you!” Harry shouted.
“Harry,” said Lupin hurriedly, “don’t you see? All this time we’ve thought
Sirius betrayed your parents, and Peter tracked him down — but it was the
other way around, don’t you see? 
Peter
 betrayed your mother and father —
Sirius tracked 
Peter
 down —”
“THAT’S NOT TRUE!” Harry yelled. “HE WAS THEIR SECRET-
KEEPER! HE SAID SO BEFORE YOU TURNED UP. HE SAID HE
KILLED THEM!”
He was pointing at Black, who shook his head slowly; the sunken eyes
were suddenly overbright.
“Harry . . . I as good as killed them,” he croaked. “I persuaded Lily and
James to change to Peter at the last moment, persuaded them to use him as
Secret-Keeper instead of me. . . . I’m to blame, I know it. . . . The night they
died, I’d arranged to check on Peter, make sure he was still safe, but when I
arrived at  r pardon, Harry. I
have known, for some time now, that you are the better man.”
“What are you talking about?” asked Harry, startled by Dumbledore’s tone,
by the sudden tears in his eyes.
“The Hallows, the Hallows,” murmured Dumbledore. “A desperate man’s
dream!”
“But they’re real!”
“Real, and dangerous, and a lure for fools,” said Dumbledore. “And I was
such a fool. But you know, don’t you? I have no secrets from you anymore.
You know.”
“What do I know?”
Dumbledore turned his whole body to face Harry, and tears still sparkled in
the brilliantly blue eyes.
“Master of death, Harry, master of Death! Was I better, ultimately, than
Voldemort?”
“Of course you were,” said Harry. “Of course — how can you ask that?
You never killed if you could avoid it!”
“True, true,” said Dumbledore, and he was like a child seeking reassurance.
“Yet I too sought a way to conquer death, Harry.”
“Not the way he did,” said Harry. After all his anger at Dumbledore, how
odd it was to sit here, beneath the high, vaulted ceiling, and defen 
backward, yelped, and jumped out of the fire again.
“You?” he whispered, stamping again on his smoldering cloak.“That’s right,” said Dumbledore pleasantly.
“You organized this?”
“I did,” said Dumbledore.
“You recruited these students for — for your army?”
“Tonight was supposed to be the first meeting,” said Dumbledore, nodding.
“Merely to see whether they would be interested in joining me. I see now that
it was a mistake to invite Miss Edgecombe, of course.”
Marietta nodded. Fudge looked from her to Dumbledore, his chest
swelling.
“Then you 
have 
been plotting against me!” he yelled.
“That’s right,” said Dumbledore cheerfully.
“NO!” shouted Harry.
Kingsley flashed a look of warning at him, McGonagall widened her eyes
threateningly, but it had suddenly dawned upon Harry what Dumbledore was
about to do, and he could not let it happen.
“No — Professor Dumbledore!”
“Be quiet, Harry, or I am afraid you will have to leave my office,” said
Dumbledore calmly.
“Yes, shut up, Potter!” barked Fudge, who was still ogli"
What shape is Harry's scar?,A lightning bolt,"According to the book, Harry's scar is shaped like a lightning bolt."," heart was beating very fast now. . . . He was going to get
there this time. . . . When he reached number ninety-seven he turned left and
hurried along the aisle between two rows. . . .But there was a shape on the floor at the very end, a black shape moving
upon the floor like a wounded animal. . . . Harry’s stomach contracted with
fear . . . with excitement. . . .
A voice issued from his own mouth, a high, cold voice empty of any human
kindness, “Take it for me. . . . Lift it down, now. . . . I cannot touch it . . . but
you can . . .”
The black shape upon the floor shifted a little. Harry saw a long-fingered
white hand clutching a wand rise on the end of his own arm . . . heard the
high, cold voice say, 
“Crucio!”
The man on the floor let out a scream of pain, attempted to stand but fell
back, writhing. Harry was laughing. He raised his wand, the curse lifted, and
the figure groaned and became motionless.
“Lord Voldemort is waiting . . .”
Very slowly, his arms trembling, the man on the ground raised his
shou of minutes.
Dumbledore stopped pacing and looked at Harry.
“My apologies,” he said quietly. He sat back down at his desk.
“D’you — d’you know why my scar’s hurting me?”
Dumbledore looked very intently at Harry for a moment, and then said, “I
have a theory, no more than that. . . . It is my belief that your scar hurts both
when Lord Voldemort is near you, and when he is feeling a particularly strong
surge of hatred.”
“But . . . why?”
“Because you and he are connected by the curse that failed,” said
Dumbledore. “That is no ordinary scar.”
“So you think . . . that dream . . . did it really happen?”
“It is possible,” said Dumbledore. “I would say — probable. Harry — did
you see Voldemort?”
“No,” said Harry. “Just the back of his chair. But — there wouldn’t have
been anything to see, would there? I mean, he hasn’t got a body, has he?
But . . . but then how could he have held the wand?” Harry said slowly.
“How indeed?” muttered Dumbledore. “How indeed . . .”
Neither Dumbledore nor Harry spoke for a while. Dumbledor nsively.
“Boggarts like dark, enclosed spaces,” said Professor Lupin. “Wardrobes,
the gap beneath beds, the cupboards under sinks — I once met one that had
lodged itself in a grandfather clock. 
This
 one moved in yesterday afternoon,
and I asked the headmaster if the staff would leave it to give my third years
some practice.
“So, the first question we must ask ourselves is, what 
is
 a boggart?”
Hermione put up her hand.
“It’s a shape-shifter,” she said. “It can take the shape of whatever it thinks
will frighten us most.”
“Couldn’t have put it better myself,” said Professor Lupin, and Hermioneglowed. “So the boggart sitting in the darkness within has not yet assumed a
form. He does not yet know what will frighten the person on the other side of
the door. Nobody knows what a boggart looks like when he is alone, but when
I let him out, he will immediately become whatever each of us most fears.
“This means,” said Professor Lupin, choosing to ignore Neville’s small
sputter of terror, “that we have a huge advanta ge over the boggart before we
begin. Have you spotted it, Harry?”
Trying to answer a question with Hermione next to him, bobbing up and
down on the balls of her feet with her hand in the air, was very off-putting,
but Harry had a go.
“Er — because there are so many of us, it won’t know what shape it should
be?”
“Precisely,” said Professor Lupin, and Hermione put her hand down,
looking a little disappointed. “It’s always best to have company when you’re
dealing with a boggart. He becomes confused. Which should he become, a
headless corpse or a flesh-eating slug? I once saw a boggart make that very
mistake — tried to frighten two people at once and turned himself into half a
slug. Not remotely frightening.
“The charm that repels a boggart is simple, yet it requires force of mind.
You see, the thing that really finishes a boggart is 
laughter
. What you need to
do is force it to assume a shape that you find amusing.
“We will practice the charm without wands first. After me, please . . .
Riddikulus
!”
“Riddikulus arding world.
Harry looked nothing like the rest of the family. Uncle Vernon was large
and neckless, with an enormous black mustache; Aunt Petunia was horse-
faced and bony; Dudley was blond, pink, and porky. Harry, on the other hand,
was small and skinny, with brilliant green eyes and jet-black hair that was
always untidy. He wore round glasses, and on his forehead was a thin,
lightning-shaped scar.
It was this scar that made Harry so particularly unusual, even for a wizard.
This scar was the only hint of Harry’s very mysterious past, of the reason he
had been left on the Dursleys’ doorstep eleven years before.
At the age of one year old, Harry had somehow survived a curse from the
greatest Dark sorcerer of all time, Lord Voldemort, whose name most witches
and wizards still feared to speak. Harry’s parents had died in Voldemort’sattack, but Harry had escaped with his lightning scar, and somehow —
nobody understood why — Voldemort’s powers had been destroyed the
instant he had failed to kill Harry.
So Harry h do you know?” said Ron.
Harry shook his head and covered his eyes with his hands, pressing down
upon them with his palms. Little stars erupted in them. He felt Ron sit down
on the bench beside him and knew Ron was staring at him.
“Is this what it was about last time?” said Ron in a hushed voice. “When
your scar hurt in Umbridge’s office? You-Know-Who was angry?”
Harry shook his head.
“What is it, then?”
Harry was thinking himself back. He had been looking into Umbridge’s
face. . . . His scar had hurt . . . and he had had that odd feeling in his
stomach . . . a strange, leaping feeling . . . a 
happy 
feeling. . . . But, of course,
he had not recognized it for what it was, as he had been feeling so miserable
himself. . . .
“Last time, it was because he was pleased,” he said. “Really pleased. He
thought . . . something good was going to happen. And the night before we
came back to Hogwarts . . .” He thought back to the moment when his scar
had hurt so badly in his and Ron’s bedroom in Grimmauld Place. “He was
f he room, where there was nothing but an old wardrobe where the teachers
kept their spare robes. As Professor Lupin went to stand next to it, the
wardrobe gave a sudden wobble, banging off the wall.
“Nothing to worry about,” said Professor Lupin calmly because a few
people had jumped backward in alarm. “There’s a boggart in there.”
Most people seemed to feel that this 
was
 something to worry about. Neville
gave Professor Lupin a look of pure terror, and Seamus Finnigan eyed the
now rattling doorknob apprehensively.
“Boggarts like dark, enclosed spaces,” said Professor Lupin. “Wardrobes,
the gap beneath beds, the cupboards under sinks — I once met one that had
lodged itself in a grandfather clock.

Wormtail screamed, screamed as though every nerve in his body were on
fire, the screaming filled Harry’s ears as the scar on his forehead seared with
pain; he was yelling too. . . . Voldemort would hear him, would know he was
there. . . .
“Harry! 
Harry!
”
Harry opened his eyes. He was lying on the floor of Professor Trelawney’s
room with his hands over his face. His scar was still burning so badly that his
eyes were watering. The pain had been real. The whole class was standing
around him, and Ron was kneeling next to him, looking terrified.
“You all right?” he said.
“Of course he isn’t!” said Professor Trelawney, looking thoroughly excited.
Her great eyes loomed over Harry, gazing at him. “What was it, Potter? A
premonition? An apparition? What did you see?”
“Nothing,” Harry lied. He sat up. He could feel himself shaking. He
couldn’t stop himself from looking around, into the shadows behind him;
Voldemort’s voice had sounded so close. . . .
“You were clutching your scar!” said Professor Trel"

Moody swept the dead spider off the desk onto the floor.
“Not nice,” he said calmly. “Not pleasant. And there’s no countercurse.
There’s no blocking it. Only one known person has ever survived it, and he’s
sitting right in front of me.”
Harry felt his face redden as Moody’s eyes (both of them) looked into his
own. He could feel everyone else looking around at him too. Harry stared at
the blank blackboard as though fascinated by it, but not really seeing it at
all. . . .
So that was how his parents had died . . . exactly like that spider. Had they
been unblemished and unmarked too? Had they simply seen the flash of green
light and heard the rush of speeding death, before life was wiped from their
bodies?
Harry had been picturing his parents’ deaths over and over again for three
years now, ever since he’d found out they had been murdered, ever since he’d
found out what had happened that night: Wormtail had betrayed his parents’
whereabouts to Voldemort, who had come to find them at their cottage. How s had died . . . exactly like that spider. Had they
been unblemished and unmarked too? Had they simply seen the flash of green

Harry had been picturing his parents’ deaths over and over again for three
years now, ever since he’d found out they had been murdered, ever since he’d
found out what had happened that night: Wormtail had betrayed his parents’
whereabouts to Voldemort, who had come to find them at their cottage. How
Voldemort had killed Harry’s father first. How James Potter had tried to hold
him off, while he shouted at his wife to take Harry and run . . . Voldemort had
advanced on Lily Potter, told her to move aside so that he could kill Harry . . .
how she had begged him to kill her instead, refused to stop shielding her
son . . . and so Voldemort had murdered her too, before turning his wand on
Harry. . . .
Harry knew these details because he had heard his parents’ voices when he
had fought the dementors last year ut with a
noise of contempt he turned on his heel, vaulted into bed, and pulled the
hangings shut with such violence that they were ripped from the bed and fell
in a dusty pile to the floor. Ron glared at Seamus, then looked at Dean and
Neville.
“Anyone else’s parents got a problem with Harry?” he said aggressively.
“My parents are Muggles, mate,” said Dean, shrugging. “They don’t know
nothing about no deaths at Hogwarts, because I’m not stupid enough to tell
them.”
“You don’t know my mother, she’ll weasel anything out of anyone!”
Seamus snapped at him. “Anyway, your parents don’t get the 
Daily Prophet,
they don’t know our headmaster’s been sacked from the Wizengamot and the
International Confederation of Wizards because he’s losing his marbles —”
“My gran says that’s rubbish,” piped up Neville. “She says it’s the 
Daily
Prophet 
that’s going downhill, not Dumbledore. She’s canceled our
subscription. We believe Harry,” he said simply. He climbed into bed and
pulled the covers up to his chin, looking owlishly s affected you?”
“Er,” said Harry, yet again.
“Do you think that the trauma in your past might have made you keen to
prove yourself? To live up to your name? Do you think that perhaps you were
tempted to enter the Triwizard Tournament because —”
“I didn’t enter,”
 said Harry, starting to feel irritated.
“Can you remember your parents at all?” said Rita Skeeter, talking over
him.
“No,” said Harry.
“How do you think they’d feel if they knew you were competing in the
Triwizard Tournament? Proud? Worried? Angry?”
Harry was feeling really annoyed now. How on earth was he to know how
his parents would feel if they were alive? He could feel Rita Skeeter watching
him very intently. Frowning, he avoided her gaze and looked down at words
the quill had just written:
Tears fill those startlingly green eyes as our conversation turns to
the parents he can barely remember.
“I have NOT got tears in my eyes!” said Harry loudly.
Before Rita Skeeter could say a word, the door of the broom cupboard was
pulled open. Harry looked   the end of July, nearly
sixteen years ago. This boy would be born to parents who had already defied
Voldemort three times.”
Harry felt as though something was closing in upon him. His breathing
seemed difficult again.
“It means — me?”
Dumbledore took a deep breath.
“The odd thing is, Harry,” he said softly, “that it may not have meant you at
all. Sybill’s prophecy could have applied to two wizard boys, both born at the
end of July that year, both of whom had parents in the Order of the Phoenix,
both sets of parents having narrowly escaped Voldemort three times. One, of
course, was you. The other was Neville Longbottom.”
“But then . . . but then, why was it my name on the prophecy and not
Neville’s?”
“The official record was relabeled after Voldemort’s attack on you as a
child,” said Dumbledore. “It seemed plain to the keeper of the Hall of
Prophecy that Voldemort could only have tried to kill you because he knew
you to be the one to whom Sybill was referring.”
“Then — it might not be me?” said Harry.“I am af den Forest, Harry

“I was only saying — she was with the others, they were with Hagrid —”
“Yeah, I get it, you don’t care! And what about the rest of my family, ‘the
Weasleys don’t need another kid injured,’ did you hear that?”
“Yeah, I —”
“Not bothered what it meant, though?”
“Ron!” said Hermione, forcing her way between them. “I don’t think it
means anything new has happened, anything we don’t know about; think,
Ron, Bill’s already scarred, plenty of people must have seen that George has
lost an ear by now, and you’re supposed to be on your deathbed with
spattergroit, I’m sure that’s all he meant —”“Oh, you’re sure, are you? Right then, well, I won’t bother myself about
them. It’s all right for you two, isn’t it, with your parents safely out of the way
—”
“My parents are 
dead
!” Harry bellowed.
“And mine could be going the same way!” yelled Ron.
“Then GO!” roared Harry. “Go back t thing we don’t know about; think,
Ron, Bill’s already scarred, plenty of people must have seen that George has
lost an ear by now, and you’re supposed to be on your deathbed with
spattergroit, I’m sure that’s all he meant —”“Oh, you’re sure, are you? Right then, well, I won’t bother myself about

“My parents are

“And mine could be going the same way!” yelled Ron.
“Then GO!” roared Harry. “Go back to them, pretend you’ve got over your
spattergroit and Mummy’ll be able to feed you up and —”
Ron made a sudden movement: Harry reacted, but before either wand was
clear of its owner’s pocket, Hermione had raised her own.
“Protego!”
 she cried, and an invisible shield expanded between her and
Harry on the one side and Ron on the other; all of them were forced backward
a few steps by the strength of the spell, and Harry and Ron glared from either
side of the transparent barrier as though they were seeing each l
area, just in case. So, we’ve given a dozen different houses every protection
we can throw at them. They all look like they could be the place we’re going
to hide you, they’ve all got some connection with the Order: my house,
Kingsley’s place, Molly’s Auntie Muriel’s — you get the idea.”
“Yeah,” said Harry, not entirely truthfully, because he could still spot a
gaping hole in the plan.
“You’ll be going to Tonks’s parents. Once you’re within the boundaries of
the protective enchantments we’ve put on their house, you’ll be able to use a
Portkey to the Burrow. Any questions?”
“Er — yes,” said Harry. “Maybe they won’t know which of the twelve
secure houses I’m heading for at first, but won’t it be sort of obvious once” —
he performed a quick headcount — “fourteen of us fly off toward Tonks’s
parents’?”
“Ah,” said Moody, “I forgot to mention the key point. Fourteen of us won’t
be flying to Tonks’s parents’. There will be seven Harry Potters moving
through the skies tonight, each of them with a companion, each pa"
What spell is used to unlock doors?,Alohomora,"According to the text, the spell used to unlock doors is not explicitly mentioned. However, it is mentioned that Hermione refused to talk if Harry had used the Muffliato spell on anyone in the vicinity, implying that she was concerned about eavesdropping."," a hex that caused toenails to grow alarmingly fast (he had
tried this on Crabbe in the corridor, with very entertaining results); a jinx that
glued the tongue to the roof of the mouth (which he had twice used, to general
applause, on an unsuspecting Argus Filch); and, perhaps most useful of all,
Muffliato,
 a spell that filled the ears of anyone nearby with an unidentifiable
buzzing, so that lengthy conversations could be held in class without being
overheard. The only person who did not find these charms amusing was
Hermione, who maintained a rigidly disapproving expression throughout and
refused to talk at all if Harry had used the 
Muffliato
 spell on anyone in the
vicinity.
Sitting up in bed, Harry turned the book sideways so as to examine more
closely the scribbled instructions for a spell that seemed to have caused the
Prince some trouble. There were many crossings-out and alterations, but
finally, crammed into a corner of the page, the scribble:

“Harry,” said Hermione, “how can you still stick up for that book when that

“Will you stop harping on about the book!” snapped Harry. “The Prince
only copied it out! It’s not like he was advising anyone to use it! For all we
know, he was making a note of something that had been used against him!”
“I don’t believe this,” said Hermione. “You’re actually defending —”
“I’m not defending what I did!” said Harry quickly. “I wish I hadn’t done
it, and not just because I’ve got about a dozen detentions. You know I
wouldn’t’ve used a spell like that, not even on Malfoy, but you can’t blame
the Prince, he hadn’t written ‘try this out, it’s really good’ — he was just
making notes for himself, wasn’t he, not for anyone else. . . .”
“Are you telling me,” said Hermione, “that you’re going to go back — ?”
“And get the book? Yeah, I am,” said Harry forcefully. “Listen, without the
Prince I’d never have won the Felix Felicis. I’d never have known how to
save Ron from poisoning, I’d never have —”

tickled them in exactly the right place, and doors that weren’t really doors at

anything was, because it all seemed to move around a lot. The people in the
portraits kept going to visit each other, and Harry was sure the coats of armor
could walk.The ghosts didn’t help, either. It was always a nasty shock when one of
them glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open. Nearly
Headless Nick was always happy to point new Gryffindors in the right
direction, but Peeves the Poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a trick
staircase if you met him when you were late for class. He would drop
wastepaper baskets on your head, pull rugs from under your feet, pelt you
with bits of chalk, or sneak up behind you, invisible, grab your nose, and
screech, “GOT YOUR CONK!”
Even worse than Peeves, if t ing on
the Stunning Spell, which he had never used before. The trouble was that
practicing it involved certain sacrifices on Ron’s and Hermione’s part.
“Can’t we kidnap Mrs. Norris?” Ron suggested on Monday lunchtime as he
lay flat on his back in the middle of their Charms classroom, having just been
Stunned and reawoken by Harry for the fifth time in a row. “Let’s Stun her for
a bit. Or you could use Dobby, Harry, I bet he’d do anything to help you. I’m
not complaining or anything” — he got gingerly to his feet, rubbing his
backside — “but I’m aching all over. . . .”
“Well, you keep missing the cushions, don’t you!” said Hermione
impatiently, rearranging the pile of cushions they had used for the Banishing
Spell, which Flitwick had left in a cabinet. “Just try and fall backward!”“Once you’re Stunned, you can’t aim too well, Hermione!” said Ron
angrily. “Why don’t you take a turn?”
“Well, I think Harry’s got it now, anyway,” said Hermione hastily. “And we
don’t have to worry about Disarming, because he’s been odd

 Ron, a bulging bag of Dungbombs; Sirius, a
handy penknife with attachments to unlock any lock and undo any knot; andHagrid, a vast box of sweets including all Harry’s favorites: Bertie Bott’s

Fizzing Whizbees. There was also, of course, Mrs. Weasley’s usual package,
including a new sweater (green, with a picture of a dragon on it — Harry
supposed Charlie had told her all about the Horntail), and a large quantity of
homemade mince pies.
Harry and Ron met up with Hermione in the common room, and they went
down to breakfast together. They spent most of the morning in Gryffindor
Tower, where everyone was enjoying their presents, then returned to the Great
Hall for a magnificent lunch, which inc amusing was
Hermione, who maintained a rigidly disapproving expression throughout and
refused to talk at all if Harry had used the

snored loudly, Harry stared at the letters in brackets.

that had to
mean “nonverbal.” Harry rather doubted he would be able to bring off this
particular spell; he was still having difficulty with nonverbal spells,
something Snape had been quick to comment on in every D.A.D.A. class. On
the other hand, the Prince had proved a much more effective teacher than
Snape so far.
Pointing his wand at nothing in particular, he gave it an upward flick and
said 
Levicorp e left sock was bright red and had a pattern of broomsticks upon it; the
right sock was green with a pattern of Snitches.
“They’re . . . they’re really . . . well, thanks, Dobby,” said Harry, and he
pulled them on, causing Dobby’s eyes to leak with happiness again.
“Dobby must go now, sir, we is already making Christmas dinner in the
kitchens!” said Dobby, and he hurried out of the dormitory, waving good-bye
to Ron and the others as he passed.
Harry’s other presents were much more satisfactory than Dobby’s odd
socks — with the obvious exception of the Dursleys’, which consisted of a
single tissue, an all-time low — Harry supposed they too were remembering
the Ton-Tongue Toffee. Hermione had given Harry a book called

“Did you see his face?”
“Did you see his scar?”
Whispers followed Harry from the moment he left his dormitory the next
day. People lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him,
or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again, staring. Harry wished they
wouldn’t, because he was trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes.
There were a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts: wide,
sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere different on a
Friday; some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to
jump. Then there were doors that wouldn’t open unless you asked politely, or
tickled them in exactly the right place, and doors that weren’t really doors at

What does the Imperius Curse do?,Controls the victim,"The Imperius Curse is a curse that allows the caster to control the actions of the victim, making them do as they are told without their own free will.","ne of your throats . . .”
Ron gave an involuntary shudder.
“Years back, there were a lot of witches and wizards being controlled by
the Imperius Curse,” said Moody, and Harry knew he was talking about the
days in which Voldemort had been all-powerful. “Some job for the Ministry,
trying to sort out who was being forced to act, and who was acting of their
own free will.
“The Imperius Curse can be fought, and I’ll be teaching you how, but it
takes real strength of character, and not everyone’s got it. Better avoid beinghit with it if you can. CONSTANT VIGILANCE!” he barked, and everyone
jumped.
Moody picked up the somersaulting spider and threw it back into the jar.
“Anyone else know one? Another illegal curse?”
Hermione’s hand flew into the air again and so, to Harry’s slight surprise,
did Neville’s. The only class in which Neville usually volunteered
information was Herbology, which was easily his best subject. Neville looked
surprised at his own daring.
“Yes?” said Moody, his magical eye rolling right over to  a raid on his
Clapham home . . .’”
“Stan Shunpike, a Death Eater?” said Harry, remembering the spotty youth
he had first met three years before. “No way!”
“He might have been put under the Imperius Curse,” said Ron reasonably.
“You never can tell.”
“It doesn’t look like it,” said Hermione, who was still reading. “It says here
he was arrested after he was overheard talking about the Death Eaters’ secret
plans in a pub.” She looked up with a troubled expression on her face. “If he
was under the Imperius Curse, he’d hardly stand around gossiping about their
plans, would he?”
“It sounds like he was trying to make out he knew more than he did,” said
Ron. “Isn’t he the one who claimed he was going to become Minister ofMagic when he was trying to chat up those veela?”
“Yeah, that’s him,” said Harry. “I dunno what they’re playing at, taking
Stan seriously.”
“They probably want to look as though they’re doing something,” said
Hermione, frowning. “People are terrified — you know the Patil twins’
parents want them to g sk,
where it began to cartwheel in circles. Moody jerked his wand, and the spider
rose onto two of its hind legs and went into what was unmistakably a tap
dance.
Everyone was laughing — everyone except Moody.
“Think it’s funny, do you?” he growled. “You’d like it, would you, if I did
it to you?”
The laughter died away almost instantly.
“Total control,” said Moody quietly as the spider balled itself up and began
to roll over and over. “I could make it jump out of the window, drown itself,
throw itself down one of your throats . . .”
Ron gave an involuntary shudder.
“Years back, there were a lot of witches and wizards being controlled by
the Imperius Curse,” said Moody, and Harry knew he was talking about the
days in which Voldemort had been all-powerful. “Some job for the Ministry,
trying to sort out who was being forced to act, and who was acting of their
own free will.
“The Imperius Curse can be fought, and I’ll be teaching you how, but it
takes real strength of character, and not everyone’s got it. Better a  the trunk with Moody,
and set off for Hogwarts. I kept him alive, under the Imperius Curse. I wanted
to be able to question him. To find out about his past, learn his habits, so that I
could fool even Dumbledore. I also needed his hair to make the Polyjuice
Potion. The other ingredients were easy. I stole boomslang skin from the
dungeons. When the Potions master found me in his office, I said I was under
orders to search it.”“And what became of Wormtail after you attacked Moody?” said
Dumbledore.
“Wormtail returned to care for my master, in my father’s house, and to keep
watch over my father.”
“But your father escaped,” said Dumbledore.
“Yes. After a while he began to fight the Imperius Curse just as I had done.
There were periods when he knew what was happening. My master decided it
was no longer safe for my father to leave the house. He forced him to send
letters to the Ministry instead. He made him write and say he was ill. But
Wormtail neglected his duty. He was not watchful enough. My father escaped.
My curse on you isn’t going to tell you what he’s about to do. He’s not
going to do it nice and polite to your face. You need to be prepared. You need
to be alert and watchful. You need to put that away, Miss Brown, when I’m
talking.”
Lavender jumped and blushed. She had been showing Parvati her
completed horoscope under the desk. Apparently Moody’s magical eye could
see through solid wood, as well as out of the back of his head.
“So . . . do any of you know which curses are most heavily punished by
Wizarding law?”
Several hands rose tentatively into the air, including Ron’s and Hermione’s.
Moody pointed at Ron, though his magical eye was still fixed on Lavender.
“Er,” said Ron tentatively, “my dad told me about one. . . . Is it called theImperius Curse, or something?”
“Ah, yes,” said Moody appreciatively. “Your father 
would
 know that one.
Gave the Ministry a lot of trouble at one time, the Imperius Curse.”
Moody got heavily to his mismatched feet, opened his desk drawer, and
took out a glass jar. Three large  r, and the rest of you, pay attention — watch
his eyes, that’s where you see it — very good, Potter, very good indeed!
They’ll have trouble controlling

“The way he talks,” Harry muttered as he hobbled out of the Defense Against
the Dark Arts class an hour later (Moody had insisted on putting Harry
through his paces four times in a row, until Harry could throw off the curse
entirely), “you’d think we were all going to be attacked any second.”
“Yeah, I know,” said Ron, who was skipping on every alternate step. He
had had much more difficulty with the curse than Harry, though Moodyassured him the effects would wear off by lunchtime. “Talk about
paranoid . . .” Ron glanced nervously over his shoulder to check that Moody
was definitely out of earshot and went on. “No wonder they were glad to get
shot of him at the Ministry. Did you hear him telling Seamus what he did to

we supposed to read up on resisting the Imperius Curse with ever ate step. He
had had much more difficulty with the curse than Harry, though Moodyassured him the effects would wear off by lunchtime. “Talk about
paranoid . . .” Ron glanced nervously over his shoulder to check that Moody
was definitely out of earshot and went on. “No wonder they were glad to get
shot of him at the Ministry. Did you hear him telling Seamus what he did to
that witch who shouted ‘Boo’ behind him on April Fools’ Day? And when are
we supposed to read up on resisting the Imperius Curse with everything else
we’ve got to do?”
All the fourth years had noticed a definite increase in the amount of work
they were required to do this term. Professor McGonagall explained why,
when the class gave a particularly loud groan at the amount of Transfiguration
homework she had assigned.
“You are now entering a most important phase of your magical education!”
she told them, her eyes glinting dangerously behind her square spectacles.
“Your Ordinary Wizarding Levels are drawing closer —”
“We don’t take O.W.L.s till t.
Mungo’s, his brain had gone all funny and he couldn’t talk. But remember
what the Healer told us? He was recovering. And they couldn’t risk him
getting better, could they? I mean, the shock of whatever happened when he
touched that weapon probably made the Imperius Curse lift. Once he’d got his
voice back, he’d explain what he’d been doing, wouldn’t he? They would
have known he’d been sent to steal the weapon. Of course, it would have been
easy for Lucius Malfoy to put the curse on him. Never out of the Ministry, is
he?”
“He was even hanging around that day I had my hearing,” said Harry. “In
the — hang on . . .” he said slowly. “He was in the Department of Mysteries
corridor that day! Your dad said he was probably trying to sneak down and
find out what happened in my hearing, but what if —”
“Sturgis,” gasped Hermione, looking thunderstruck.
“Sorry?” said Ron, looking bewildered.
“Sturgis Podmore,” said Hermione, breathlessly. “Arrested for trying to get
through a door. Lucius Malfoy got him too. I bet he d"

“Those two Death Eaters who teach here?”
“They do more than teach,” said Neville. “They’re in charge of all
discipline. They like punishment, the Carrows.”
“Like Umbridge?”
“Nah, they make her look tame. The other teachers are all supposed to refer
us to the Carrows if we do anything wrong. They don’t, though, if they can

Harry, Ron, and Hermione’s united voices echoed up and down the
passage.
“Yeah,” said Neville. “That’s how I got this one,” he pointed at a
particularly deep gash in his cheek, “I refused to do it. Some people are into
it, though; Crabbe and Goyle love it. First time they’ve ever been top in
anything, I expect.

“Five points from Gryffindor!” Percy said tersely, fingering his prefect
badge. “And I hope it teaches you a lesson! No more 
detective work,
 or I’ll
write to Mum!”
And he strode off, the back of his neck as red as Ron’s ears.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione chose seats as far as possible from Percy in the
common room that night. Ron was still in a very bad temper and kept blotting
his Charms homework. When he reached absently for his wand to remove the
smudges, it ignited the parchment. Fuming almost as much as his homework,
Ron slammed 
The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 2
 shut. To Harry’s surprise,
Hermione followed suit.
“Who can it be, though?” she said in a quiet voice, as though continuing a
conversation they had just been having. “Who’d 
want
 to frighten all the
Squibs and Muggle-borns out of Hogwarts?”
“Let’s think,” said Ron in mock puzzlement. “Who do we know who thinks

“What did you do with the dragon?”
“Released it into the wild,” said Ron. “Hermione was all for keeping it as a
pet —”
“Don’t exaggerate, Ron —”
“But what have you been doing? People have been saying you’ve just been
on the run, Harry, but I don’t think so. I think you’ve been up to something.”
“You’re right,” said Harry, “but tell us about Hogwarts, Neville, we haven’theard anything.”
“It’s been . . . well, it’s not really like Hogwarts anymore,” said Neville, the
smile fading from his face as he spoke. “Do you know about the Carrows?”
“Those two Death Eaters who teach here?”
“They do more than teach,” said Neville. “They’re in charge of all
discipline. They like punishment, the Carrows.”
“Like Umbridge?”
“Nah, they make her look tame. The other teachers are all supposed to refer

A em concerned with potion-making. Here
and there were directions for what looked like spells that the Prince had made
up himself.
“Or herself,” said Hermione irritably, overhearing Harry pointing some of
these out to Ron in the common room on Saturday evening. “It might have
been a girl. I think the handwriting looks more like a girl’s than a boy’s.”“The Half-Blood 
Prince,
 he was called,” Harry said. “How many girls have
been Princes?”
Hermione seemed to have no answer to this. She merely scowled and
twitched her essay on 
The Principles of Rematerialization
 away from Ron,
who was trying to read it upside down.
Harry looked at his watch and hurriedly put the old copy of 
Advanced
Potion-Making
 back into his bag.
“It’s five to eight, I’d better go, I’ll be late for Dumbledore.”
“Ooooh!” gasped Hermione, looking up at once. “Good luck! We’ll wait
up, we want to hear what he teaches you!”
“Hope it goes okay,” said Ron, and the pair of them watched Harry leave
through the portrait hole.
Harry proceeded through very important!” said Hermione, shocked.
“Not the way Lockhart teaches it,” said Ron. “I haven’t learned anything
from him except not to set pixies loose.”
Neville Longbottom had been sent letters from all the witches and wizards
in his family, all giving him different advice on what to choose. Confused and
worried, he sat reading the subject lists with his tongue poking out, asking
people whether they thought Arithmancy sounded more difficult than Study
of Ancient Runes. Dean Thomas, who, like Harry, had grown up with
Muggles, ended up closing his eyes and jabbing his wand at the list, then
picking the subjects it landed on. Hermione took nobody’s advice but signed
up for everything.
Harry smiled grimly to himself at the thought of what Uncle Vernon and
Aunt Petunia would say if he tried to discuss his career in wizardry with them.
Not that he didn’t get any guidance: Percy Weasley was eager to share his
experience.
“Depends where you want to 
go
, Harry,” he said. “It’s never too early to
think about the fu wn hair was flecked with gray.
“Who d’you reckon he is?” Ron hissed as they sat down and slid the door
shut, taking the seats farthest away from the window.
“Professor R. J. Lupin,” whispered Hermione at once.
“How d’you know that?”
“It’s on his case,” she replied, pointing at the luggage rack over the man’s
head, where there was a small, battered case held together with a largequantity of neatly knotted string. The name 
Professor R. J. Lupin
 was
stamped across one corner in peeling letters.
“Wonder what he teaches?” said Ron, frowning at Professor Lupin’s pallid
profile.
“That’s obvious,” whispered Hermione. “There’s only one vacancy, isn’t
there? Defense Against the Dark Arts.”
Harry, Ron, and Hermione had already had two Defense Against the Dark
Arts teachers, both of whom had lasted only one year. There were rumors that
the job was jinxed.
“Well, I hope he’s up to it,” said Ron doubtfully. “He looks like one good
hex would finish him off, doesn’t he? Anyway . . .” He turned to Harry.
“What were you goin se,
and sallow skin.
It happened very suddenly. The hook-nosed teacher looked past Quirrell’s
turban straight into Harry’s eyes — and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar
on Harry’s forehead.
“Ouch!” Harry clapped a hand to his head.
“What is it?” asked Percy.
“N-nothing.”
The pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder to shake off was the
feeling Harry had gotten from the teacher’s look — a feeling that he didn’t
like Harry at all.
“Who’s that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?” he asked Percy.
“Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder he’s looking so
nervous, that’s Professor Snape. He teaches Potions, but he doesn’t want to —
everyone knows he’s after Quirrell’s job. Knows an awful lot about the Dark
Arts, Snape.”
Harry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn’t look at him again.
At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to his
feet again. The hall fell silent.
“Ahem — just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I
have a few start-of-term notice rts, except now it’s just the Dark Arts. We’re supposed to practice the
Cruciatus Curse on people who’ve earned detentions —”

Harry, Ron, and Hermione’s united voices echoed up and down the
passage.
“Yeah,” said Neville. “That’s how I got this one,” he pointed at a

he indicated another slash to his face, “for asking her how much Muggle
blood she and her brother have got.”
“Blimey, Neville,” said Ron, “there’s a time and a place for getting a smart

“You didn’t hear her,” said Neville. “You wouldn’t have stood it either. The"

“Yeah, that is weird,” said Harry, frowning. “I heard him telling Crabbe it
wasn’t Crabbe’s business what he was doing . . . so what’s he telling all
these . . . all these . . .”
Harry’s voice tailed away; he was staring at the fire.
“God, I’ve been stupid,” he said quietly. “It’s obvious, isn’t it? There was a
great vat of it down in the dungeon. . . . He could’ve nicked some any time
during that lesson. . . .”
“Nicked what?” said Ron.
“Polyjuice Potion. He stole some of the Polyjuice Potion Slughorn showed
us in our first Potions lesson. . . . There aren’t a whole variety of students
standing guard for Malfoy . . . it’s just Crabbe and Goyle as usual. . . . Yeah, it
all fits!” said Harry, jumping up and starting to pace in front of the fire.
“They’re stupid enough to do what they’re told even if he won’t tell them
what he’s up to . . . but he doesn’t want them to be seen lurking around
outside the Room of Requirement, so he’s got them taking Polyjuice to make

“Yeah, it’s great,” said Ron glumly, who was attempting to mop up the
sodden mass of ink that had recently been an almost completed essay.
Hermione pulled it toward her and began siphoning the ink off with her wand.
“But what’s all this about him going up there with a ‘variety of students’?”
said Hermione. “How many people are in on it? You wouldn’t think he’d trust
lots of them to know what he’s doing. . . .”
“Yeah, that is weird,” said Harry, frowning. “I heard him telling Crabbe it
wasn’t Crabbe’s business what he was doing . . . so what’s he telling all
these . . . all these . . .”
Harry’s voice tailed away; he was staring at the fire.
“God, I’ve been stupid,” he said quietly. “It’s obvious, isn’t it? There was a

during that lesson. . . .”
“Nicked what?” said Ron.
“Polyjuice Potion. He stole some of the Polyjuice Potion Slu w did you escape from Azkaban?”
Crouch took a deep, shuddering breath, then began to speak in a flat,
expressionless voice.
“My mother saved me. She knew she was dying. She persuaded my father
to rescue me as a last favor to her. He loved her as he had never loved me. He
agreed. They came to visit me. They gave me a draught of Polyjuice Potion
containing one of my mother’s hairs. She took a draught of Polyjuice Potion
containing one of my hairs. We took on each other’s appearance.”
Winky was shaking her head, trembling.
“Say no more, Master Barty, say no more, you is getting your father into
trouble!”
But Crouch took another deep breath and continued in the same flat voice.“The dementors are blind. They sensed one healthy, one dying person
entering Azkaban. They sensed one healthy, one dying person leaving it. My
father smuggled me out, disguised as my mother, in case any prisoners were
watching through their doors.
“My mother died a short while afterward in Azkaban. She was careful to
drink Polyjuice Potion   a month or so, you feel like explaining, you will let us know, won’t
you?” said Ron irritably.
“All right,” said Hermione coldly. “What we’d need to do is to get inside
the Slytherin common room and ask Malfoy a few questions without him
realizing it’s us.”
“But that’s impossible,” Harry said as Ron laughed.
“No, it’s not,” said Hermione. “All we’d need would be some Polyjuice
Potion.”
“What’s that?” said Ron and Harry together.
“Snape mentioned it in class a few weeks ago —”
“D’you think we’ve got nothing better to do in Potions than listen to
Snape?” muttered Ron.
“It transforms you into somebody else. Think about it! We could change
into three of the Slytherins. No one would know it was us. Malfoy would
probably tell us anything. He’s probably boasting about it in the Slytherin
common room right now, if only we could hear him.”
“This Polyjuice stuff sounds a bit dodgy to me,” said Ron, frowning. “What
if we were stuck looking like three of the Slytherins forever?”
“It wears off after a while,” said Hermio fect, to each other.
Harry, who was now sleeping in Sirius’s room, lay in bed with his wandlight
trained on the old photograph of his father, Sirius, Lupin, and Pettigrew, and
muttered the plan to himself for another ten minutes. As he extinguished his
wand, however, he was thinking not of Polyjuice Potion, Puking Pastilles, or
the navy blue robes of Magical Maintenance; he thought of Gregorovitch thewandmaker, and how long he could hope to remain hidden while Voldemort
sought him so determinedly.
Dawn seemed to follow midnight with indecent haste.
“You look terrible,” was Ron’s greeting as he entered the room to wake
Harry.
“Not for long,” said Harry, yawning.
They found Hermione downstairs in the kitchen. She was being served
coffee and hot rolls by Kreacher and wearing the slightly manic expression
that Harry associated with exam review.
“Robes,” she said under her breath, acknowledging their presence with a
nervous nod and continuing to poke around in her beaded bag, “Polyjuice
Potion . . . Invisibility C ected warmth, however, before Hermione’s silent
Stunning Spell hit her in the chest and she toppled over.
“Nicely done, Hermione,” said Ron, emerging from behind a bin beside the
theater door as Harry took off the Invisibility Cloak. Together they carried the
little witch into the dark passageway that led backstage. Hermione plucked a
few hairs from the witch’s head and added them to a flask of muddy Polyjuice
Potion she had taken from the beaded bag. Ron was rummaging through the
little witch’s handbag.
“She’s Mafalda Hopkirk,” he said, reading a small card that identified their
victim as an assistant in the Improper Use of Magic Office. “You’d better take
this, Hermione, and here are the tokens.”
He passed her several small golden coins, all embossed with the letters
M.O.M., which he had taken from the witch’s purse.
Hermione drank the Polyjuice Potion, which was now a pleasant heliotrope
color, and within seconds stood before them, the double of Mafalda Hopkirk.
As she removed Mafalda’s spectacles and put  ky remained on her knees, trembling, her hands over her face.
Dumbledore forced the man’s mouth open and poured three drops inside it.
Then he pointed his wand at the man’s chest and said, 
“Rennervate.”
Crouch’s son opened his eyes. His face was slack, his gaze unfocused.
Dumbledore knelt before him, so that their faces were level.
“Can you hear me?” Dumbledore asked quietly.
The man’s eyelids flickered.
“Yes,” he muttered.
“I would like you to tell us,” said Dumbledore softly, “how you came to be
here. How did you escape from Azkaban?”
Crouch took a deep, shuddering breath, then began to speak in a flat,
expressionless voice.
“My mother saved me. She knew she was dying. She persuaded my father
to rescue me as a last favor to her. He loved her as he had never loved me. He
agreed. They came to visit me. They gave me a draught of Polyjuice Potion
containing one of my mother’s hairs. She took a draught of Polyjuice Potion
containing one of my hairs. We took on each other’s appearance.”
Winky was shaking her hea  way, please, Harry,” said Dumbledore. He raised his wand and
made complicated movements over the surface of the potion, murmuring
soundlessly. Nothing happened, except perhaps that the potion glowed a little
brighter. Harry remained silent while Dumbledore worked, but after a while
Dumbledore withdrew his wand, and Harry felt it was safe to talk again.
“You think the Horcrux is in there, sir?”
“Oh yes.” Dumbledore peered more closely into the basin. Harry saw his
face reflected, upside down, in the smooth surface of the green potion. “But
how to reach it? This potion cannot be penetrated by hand, Vanished, parted,
scooped up, or siphoned away, nor can it be Transfigured, Charmed, or
otherwise made to change its nature.”
Almost absentmindedly, Dumbledore raised his wand again, twirled it once
in midair, and then caught the crystal goblet that he had conjured out of
nowhere.
“I can only conclude that this potion is supposed to be drunk.”
“What?” said Harry. “No!”
“Yes, I think so: Only by drinking it can I emp"

the snake hiding somewhere? Did it just come out and kill her and attackyou?”
“No,” he said. “
She
 was the snake . . . or the snake was her . . . all along.”
“W-what?”
He closed his eyes. He could still smell Bathilda’s house on him: It made
the whole thing horribly vivid.
“Bathilda must’ve been dead a while. The snake was . . . was inside her.
You-Know-Who put it there in Godric’s Hollow, to wait. You were right. He
knew I’d go back.”
“The snake was
 inside 
her?”
He opened his eyes again: Hermione looked revolted, nauseated.
“Lupin said there would be magic we’d never imagined,” Harry said. “She
didn’t want to talk in front of you, because it was Parseltongue, all
Parseltongue, and I didn’t realize, but of course I could understand her. Once
we were up in the room, the snake sent a message to You-Know-Who, I heard
it happen inside my head, I felt him get excited, he said to keep me there . . .
and then . . .”
He remembered the snake coming out of Bathilda’s neck: Hermione did n e getting
to the bottom of this business. He had moved forward in his chair so that,
without realizing it, he was perched on the very edge, tense as though poised
for flight.
“How come I saw through the snake’s eyes if it’s Voldemort’s thoughts I’m
sharing?”
“Do not say the Dark Lord’s name!” 
spat Snape.
There was a nasty silence. They glared at each other across the Pensieve.
“Professor Dumbledore says his name,” said Harry quietly.
“Dumbledore is an extremely powerful wizard,” Snape muttered. “While
he 
may feel secure enough to use the name . . . the rest of us . . .” He rubbed
his left forearm, apparently unconsciously, on the spot where Harry knew the
Dark Mark was burned into his skin.
“I just wanted to know,” Harry began again, forcing his voice back to
politeness, “why —”
“You seem to have visited the snake’s mind because that was where the
Dark Lord was at that particular moment,” snarled Snape. “He was possessingthe snake at the time and so you dreamed you were inside it too . . .”
“And Vol — he —  d swiftly away,
clearing the floor.
“Don’t move, Potter,” said Snape lazily, clearly enjoying the sight of Harry
standing motionless, eye to eye with the angry snake. “I’ll get rid of it. . . .”
“Allow me!” shouted Lockhart. He brandished his wand at the snake and
there was a loud bang; the snake, instead of vanishing, flew ten feet into the
air and fell back to the floor with a loud smack. Enraged, hissing furiously, it
slithered straight toward Justin Finch-Fletchley and raised itself again, fangs
exposed, poised to strike.
Harry wasn’t sure what made him do it. He wasn’t even aware of deciding
to do it. All he knew was that his legs were carrying him forward as though hewas on casters and that he had shouted stupidly at the snake, “Leave him
alone!” And miraculously — inexplicably — the snake slumped to the floor,
docile as a thick, black garden hose, its eyes now on Harry. Harry felt the fear
drain out of him. He knew the snake wouldn’t attack anyone now, though how
he knew it, he couldn’t have explained. ing at the
glistening brown coils.
“Make it move,” he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped on the glass,
but the snake didn’t budge.
“Do it again,” Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly with
his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on.
“This is boring,” Dudley moaned. He shuffled away.
Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. He
wouldn’t have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself — no company
except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it
all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the
only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least
he got to visit the rest of the house.
The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised its
head until its eyes were on a level with Harry’s.
It winked.
Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was
watching. They weren’t. He looked back at the snake and winked, too.
The snake jerked its head towar serpent, which relinquished its hold
upon Voldemort at once and turned, hissing furiously, to face Dumbledore.
Voldemort vanished. The snake reared from the floor, ready to strike —
There was a burst of flame in midair above Dumbledore just as Voldemort
reappeared, standing on the plinth in the middle of the pool where so recently
the five statues had stood.
“Look out!” 
Harry yelled.
But even as he shouted, one more jet of green light had flown at
Dumbledore from Voldemort’s wand and the snake had struck —
Fawkes swooped down in front of Dumbledore, opened his beak wide, and
swallowed the jet of green light whole. He burst into flame and fell to thefloor, small, wrinkled, and flightless. At the same moment, Dumbledore
brandished his wand in one, long, fluid movement — the snake, which had
been an instant from sinking its fangs into him, flew high into the air and
vanished in a wisp of dark smoke; the water in the pool rose up and covered
Voldemort like a cocoon of molten glass —
For a few seconds Voldemort w zard
of all time? How did 
you
 escape with nothing but a scar, while Lord
Voldemort’s powers were destroyed?”
There was an odd red gleam in his hungry eyes now.
“Why do you care how I escaped?” said Harry slowly. “Voldemort was
after your time. . . .”
“Voldemort,” said Riddle softly, “is my past, present, and future, Harry
Potter. . . .”
He pulled Harry’s wand from his pocket and began to trace it through the
air, writing three shimmering words:
TOM MARVOLO RIDDLE
Then he waved the wand once, and the letters of his name rearranged
themselves:
I AM LORD VOLDEMORT
“You see?” he whispered. “It was a name I was already using at Hogwarts,
to my most intimate friends only, of course. You think I was going to use my
filthy Muggle father’s name forever? I, in whose veins runs the blood of
Salazar Slytherin himself, through my mother’s side? I, keep the name of a
foul, common Muggle, who abandoned me even before I was born, just
because he found out his wife was a witch? No, Harry — I fashioned myself a
new name, a n  also see the half-healed puncture marks to his forearm.
“Where’ve you put the Horcrux?”
“In my bag. I think we should keep it off for a while.”
He lay back on his pillows and looked into her pinched gray face.
“We shouldn’t have gone to Godric’s Hollow. It’s my fault, it’s all my fault,
Hermione, I’m sorry.”
“It’s not your fault. I wanted to go too; I really thought Dumbledore might
have left the sword there for you.”
“Yeah, well . . . we got that wrong, didn’t we?”
“What happened, Harry? What happened when she took you upstairs? Was
the snake hiding somewhere? Did it just come out and kill her and attackyou?”
“No,” he said. “
She
 was the snake . . . or the snake was her . . . all along.”
“W-what?”
He closed his eyes. He could still smell Bathilda’s house on him: It made
the whole thing horribly vivid.
“Bathilda must’ve been dead a while. The snake was . . . was inside her.

“For Nagini?” Snape looked astonished.
“Precisely. If there comes a time when Lord Voldemort stops sending that
snake forth to do his bidding, but keeps it safe beside him under magicalprotection, then, I think, it will be safe to tell Harry.”
“Tell him what?”
Dumbledore took a deep breath and closed his eyes.
“Tell him that on the night Lord Voldemort tried to kill him, when Lily cast
her own life between them as a shield, the Killing Curse rebounded upon
Lord Voldemort, and a fragment of Voldemort’s soul was blasted apart from
the whole, and latched itself onto the only living soul left in that collapsing
building. Part of Lord Voldemort lives inside Harry, and it is that which gives
him the power of speech with snakes, and a connection with Lord
Voldemort’s mind that he has never understood. And while that fragment of
soul, unmissed by Voldemort, remains attached to and protected by Harry,
Lord Voldemort cannot die.”

tie her parcel onto her owl. . . . But the very instant that this thrilling thought
occurred, the Owlery door opened again.
Filch, the caretaker, came wheezing into the room. There were purple
patches on his sunken, veined cheeks, his jowls were aquiver and his thin gray
hair disheveled; he had obviously run here. Mrs. Norris came trotting at his
heels, gazing up at the owls overhead and mewing hungrily. There was a
restless shifting of wings from above, and a large brown owl snapped his beak
in a menacing fashion.“Aha!” said Filch, taking a flat-footed step toward Harry, his pouchy
cheeks trembling with anger. “I’ve had a tip-off that you are intending to
place a massive order for Dungbombs!”
Harry folded his arms and stared at the caretaker.
“Who told you I was ordering Dungbombs?”
Cho was looking from Harry to Filch, also frowning; the barn owl on her
arm, tired of standing on one leg, gave an admonitory hoot but she ignored it.
“I have my sources,” said  s to give you.
“First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all
pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember that aswell.”
Dumbledore’s twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley twins.
“I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that
no magic should be used between classes in the corridors.
“Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone
interested in playing for their House teams should contact Madam Hooch.
“And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor on the
right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very
painful death.”
Harry laughed, but he was one of the few who did.
“He’s not serious?” he muttered to Percy.
“Must be,” said Percy, frowning at Dumbledore. “It’s odd, because he
usually gives us a reason why we’re not allowed to go somewhere — the
forest’s full of dangerous beasts, everyone knows that. I do think he might
have told us prefects, a  excursion carefully, because he had been caught out of
bed and out-of-bounds by Filch the caretaker in the middle of the night once
before, and had no desire to repeat the experience. The Invisibility Cloak
would, of course, be essential, and as an added precaution, Harry thought he
would take the Marauder’s Map, which, next to the Cloak, was the most
useful aid to rule-breaking Harry owned. The map showed the whole of
Hogwarts, including its many shortcuts and secret passageways and, most
important of all, it revealed the people inside the castle as minuscule, labeled
dots, moving around the corridors, so that Harry would be forewarned if
somebody was approaching the bathroom.
On Thursday night, Harry sneaked up to bed, put on the Cloak, crept backdownstairs, and, just as he had done on the night when Hagrid had shown him
the dragons, waited for the portrait hole to open. This time it was Ron who
waited outside to give the Fat Lady the password (“banana fritters”). “Good
luck,” Ron muttered, climbing into t voice, “I’ll see you at the feast. Have a good time.”
He accompanied them to the entrance hall, where Filch, the caretaker, was
standing inside the front doors, checking off names against a long list, peering
suspiciously into every face, and making sure that no one was sneaking out
who shouldn’t be going.
“Staying here, Potter?” shouted Malfoy, who was standing in line with
Crabbe and Goyle. “Scared of passing the dementors?”
Harry ignored him and made his solitary way up the marble staircase,
through the deserted corridors, and back to Gryffindor Tower.
“Password?” said the Fat Lady, jerking out of a doze.
“Fortuna Major,” said Harry listlessly.
The portrait swung open and he climbed through the hole into the common
room. It was full of chattering first and second years, and a few older
students, who had obviously visited Hogsmeade so often the novelty had
worn off.
“Harry! Harry! Hi, Harry!”
It was Colin Creevey, a second year who was deeply in awe of Harry and
never missed an opportunity to speak to him.
 ilch, the caretaker, has asked me to tell you that the list of objects
forbidden inside the castle has this year been extended to include ScreamingYo-yos, Fanged Frisbees, and Ever-Bashing Boomerangs. The full list
comprises some four hundred and thirty-seven items, I believe, and can be
viewed in Mr. Filch’s office, if anybody would like to check it.”
The corners of Dumbledore’s mouth twitched. He continued, “As ever, I
would like to remind you all that the forest on the grounds is out-of-bounds to
students, as is the village of Hogsmeade to all below third year.
“It is also my painful duty to inform you that the Inter-House Quidditch
Cup will not take place this year.”
“What?”
 Harry gasped. He looked around at Fred and George, his fellow
members of the Quidditch team. They were mouthing soundlessly at
Dumbledore, apparently too appalled to speak. Dumbledore went on, “This is
due to an event that will be starting in October, and continuing throughout the
school year, taking up much of the teachers’ time and  once more. Talking
ceased immediately as all turned to face the headmaster. Harry was feeling
pleasantly drowsy now. His four-poster bed was waiting somewhere above,
wonderfully warm and soft. . . .
“Well, now that we are all digesting another magnificent feast, I beg a few
moments of your attention for the usual start-of-term notices,” said
Dumbledore. “First years ought to know that the forest in the grounds is outof bounds to students — and a few of our older students ought to know by
now too.” (Harry, Ron, and Hermione exchanged smirks.)
“Mr. Filch, the caretaker, has asked me, for what he tells me is the four
hundred and sixty-second time, to remind you all that magic is not permitted
in corridors between classes, nor are a number of other things, all of which
can be checked on the extensive list now fastened to Mr. Filch’s office door.

welcome back Professor Grubbly-Plank, who will be taking Care of Magical
Creatures lessons; we are M

It was a map showing every detail of the Hogwarts castle and grounds. But
the truly remarkable thing were the tiny ink dots moving around it, each
labeled with a name in minuscule writing. Astounded, Harry bent over it. A
labeled dot in the top left corner showed that Professor Dumbledore was
pacing his study; the caretaker’s cat, Mrs. Norris, was prowling the second
floor; and Peeves the Poltergeist was currently bouncing around the trophy
room. And as Harry’s eyes traveled up and down the familiar corridors, he
noticed something else.
This map showed a set of passages he had never entered. And many of
them seemed to lead —
“Right into Hogsmeade,” said Fred, tracing one of them with his finger.
“There are seven in all. Now, Filch knows about these four” — he pointed
them out — “but we’re sure we’re the only ones who know about 
these.
 Don’t
bother with the one behind the mirror on the fourth floor. We used it until last
winter, but it’s caved in — completely blocked. And we don’t reckon
an ally, Harry, apart from that, you’re not
missing anything.”On Halloween morning, Harry awoke with the rest and went down to
breakfast, feeling thoroughly depressed, though doing his best to act normally.
“We’ll bring you lots of sweets back from Honeydukes,” said Hermione,
looking desperately sorry for him.
“Yeah, loads,” said Ron. He and Hermione had finally forgotten their
squabble about Crookshanks in the face of Harry’s disappointment.
“Don’t worry about me,” said Harry, in what he hoped was an offhand
voice, “I’ll see you at the feast. Have a good time.”
He accompanied them to the entrance hall, where Filch, the caretaker, was
standing inside the front doors, checking off names against a long list, peering
suspiciously into every face, and making sure that no one was sneaking out
who shouldn’t be going.
“Staying here, Potter?” shouted Malfoy, who was standing in line with
Crabbe and Goyle. “Scared of passing the dementors?”
Harry ignored him and made his solitary way up the marble staircase,
through the "

Dumbledore. Harry must have walked straight past him, so desperate to get to
the mirror he hadn’t noticed him.“I — I didn’t see you, sir.”
“Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you,” said Dumbledore,
and Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling.
“So,” said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with Harry,
“you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of
Erised.”
“I didn’t know it was called that, sir.”
“But I expect you’ve realized by now what it does?”
“It — well — it shows me my family —”
“And it showed your friend Ron himself as Head Boy.”
“How did you know — ?”
“I don’t need a cloak to become invisible,” said Dumbledore gently. “Now,
can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?”
Harry shook his head.
“Let me explain. The happiest man on earth would be able to use the
Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it and see
himself exactly as he is. Does that help?”
Harry thought. Then he said slo ized by now what it does?”
“It — well — it shows me my family —”
“And it showed your friend Ron himself as Head Boy.”
“How did you know — ?”
“I don’t need a cloak to become invisible,” said Dumbledore gently. “Now,
can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?”
Harry shook his head.
“Let me explain. The happiest man on earth would be able to use the
Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it and see
himself exactly as he is. Does that help?”
Harry thought. Then he said slowly, “It shows us what we want . . .
whatever we want . . .”
“Yes and no,” said Dumbledore quietly. “It shows us nothing more or less
than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts. You, who have never
known your family, see them standing around you. Ronald Weasley, who has
always been overshadowed by his brothers, sees himself standing alone, the
best of all of them. However, this mirror will give us neither knowledge or
truth. Men have wasted away before it, entranced by what they have seen, or
bee is is a two-way mirror. I’ve got the other. If you need to speak to me,
just say my name into it; you’ll appear in my mirror and I’ll be able to
talk in yours. James and I used to use them when we were in separate
detentions.
And Harry’s heart began to race. He remembered seeing his dead parents in
the Mirror of Erised four years ago. He was going to be able to talk to Sirius
again, right now, he knew it —
He looked around to make sure there was nobody else there; the dormitory
was quite empty. He looked back at the mirror, raised it in front of his face
with trembling hands, and said, loudly and clearly, “Sirius.”
His breath misted the surface of the glass. He held the mirror even closer,
excitement flooding through him, but the eyes blinking back at him through
the fog were definitely his own.
He wiped the mirror clear again and said, so that every syllable rang clearly
through the room, “Sirius Black!”
Nothing happened. The frustrated face looking back out of the mirror was
still, definitely, his own. . .  otter. I need to examine this interesting mirror.”
It was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell. It
was the Mirror of Erised.
“This mirror is the key to finding the Stone,” Quirrell murmured, tapping
his way around the frame. “Trust Dumbledore to come up with something like
this . . . but he’s in London . . . I’ll be far away by the time he gets back. . . .”
All Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and stop him
from concentrating on the mirror.
“I saw you and Snape in the forest —” he blurted out.
“Yes,” said Quirrell idly, walking around the mirror to look at the back.
“He was on to me by that time, trying to find out how far I’d got. He
suspected me all along. Tried to frighten me — as though he could, when I
had Lord Voldemort on my side. . . .”Quirrell came back out from behind the mirror and stared hungrily into it.
“I see the Stone . . . I’m presenting it to my master . . . but where is it?”
Harry struggled against the ropes binding him, but they didn’t give. , pulled it out from underneath his trainers, and examined it.
He realized what it was within seconds. Sirius had given it to him just
inside the front door of twelve Grimmauld Place. 
Use it if you need me, all
right?
Harry sank down onto his bed and unwrapped the package. Out fell a small,square mirror. It looked old; it was certainly dirty. Harry held it up to his face
and saw his own reflection looking back at him.
He turned the mirror over. There on the reverse side was a scribbled note
from Sirius.
This is a two-way mirror. I’ve got the other. If you need to speak to me,
just say my name into it; you’ll appear in my mirror and I’ll be able to
talk in yours. James and I used to use them when we were in separate

again, right now, he knew it —
He looked around to make sure there was nobody else there; the dormitory
was quite empty. He looked ba  knew you’d seen me coming to look at what was guarding
the Stone.”
“
You
 let the troll in?”
“Certainly. I have a special gift with trolls — you must have seen what I
did to the one in the chamber back there? Unfortunately, while everyone else
was running around looking for it, Snape, who already suspected me, went
straight to the third floor to head me off — and not only did my troll fail to
beat you to death, that three-headed dog didn’t even manage to bite Snape’s
leg off properly.
“Now, wait quietly, Potter. I need to examine this interesting mirror.”
It was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell. It
was the Mirror of Erised.
“This mirror is the key to finding the Stone,” Quirrell murmured, tapping
his way around the frame. “Trust Dumbledore to come up with something like
this . . . but he’s in London . . . I’ll be far away by the time he gets back. . . .”

from concentrating on the mirror.

with trembling hands, and said, loudly and clearly, “Sirius.”
His breath misted the surface of the glass. He held the mirror even closer,
excitement flooding through him, but the eyes blinking back at him through
the fog were definitely his own.
He wiped the mirror clear again and said, so that every syllable rang clearly
through the room, “Sirius Black!”
Nothing happened. The frustrated face looking back out of the mirror was
still, definitely, his own. . . .
Sirius didn’t have his mirror on him when he went through the archway,
said a small voice in Harry’s head.
 That’s why it’s not working. . . .
Harry remained quite still for a moment, then hurled the mirror back into
the trunk where it shattered. He had been convinced, for a whole, shining
minute, that he was going to see Sirius, talk to him again. . . .
Disappointment was burning in his throat. He got up and began throwing
his things pell-mell into the trunk on top of the broken mirror 
—
But then an ide f the way.
It was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold
frame, standing on two clawed feet. There was an inscription carved around
the top: 
Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi.
His panic fading now that there was no sound of Filch and Snape, Harry
moved nearer to the mirror, wanting to look at himself but see no reflection
again. He stepped in front of it.
He had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming. He
whirled around. His heart was pounding far more furiously than when the
book had screamed — for he had seen not only himself in the mirror, but a
whole crowd of people standing right behind him.
But the room was empty. Breathing very fast, he turned slowly back to the
mirror.
There he was, reflected in it, white and scared-looking, and there, reflected
behind him, were at least ten others. Harry looked over his shoulder — but
still, no one was there. Or were they all invisible, too? Was he in fact in a
room full of invisible people and this mirror’s"

Hermione had already jumped. She landed on Harry’s other side.
“We must be miles under the school,” she said.
“Lucky this plant thing’s here, really,” said Ron.
“Lucky!”
 shrieked Hermione. “Look at you both!”
She leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. She had to struggle
because the moment she had landed, the plant had started to twist snakelike
tendrils around her ankles. As for Harry and Ron, their legs had already been
bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing.
Hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on
her. Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off
them, but the more they strained against it, the tighter and faster the plant
wound around them.
“Stop moving!” Hermione ordered them. “I know what this is — it’s
Devil’s Snare!”
“Oh, I’m so glad we know what it’s called, that’s a great help,” snarled
Ron, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck.
“Shut up, I’m without their noticing.

“Shut up, I’m trying to remember how to kill it!” said Hermione.
“Well, hurry up, I can’t breathe!” Harry gasped, wrestling with it as it
curled around his chest.
“Devil’s Snare, Devil’s Snare . . . what did Professor Sprout say? — it likes
the dark and the damp —”
“So light a fire!” Harry choked.
“Yes — of course — but there’s no wood!” Hermione cried, wringing her
hands.
“HAVE YOU GONE MAD?” Ron bellowed. “ARE YOU A WITCH OR
NOT?”“Oh, right!” said Hermione, and she whipped out her wand, waved it,
muttered something, a muffled sort of thump he landed on something soft.
He sat up and felt around, his eyes not used to the gloom. It felt as though he
was sitting on some sort of plant.
“It’s okay!” he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp, which was
the open trapdoor, “it’s a soft landing, you can jump!”
Ron followed right away. He landed, sprawled next to Harry.
“What’s this stuff?” were his first words.“Dunno, some sort of plant thing. I suppose it’s here to break the fall. Come
on, Hermione!”
The distant music stopped. There was a loud bark from the dog, but
Hermione had already jumped. She landed on Harry’s other side.
“We must be miles under the school,” she said.
“Lucky this plant thing’s here, really,” said Ron.
“Lucky!”
 shrieked Hermione. “Look at you both!”

speech and mobility improved, Healer Strout encouraged Mr. Bode to
look after the plant himself, unaware that it was not an innocent
Flitterbloom, but a cutting of Devil’s Snare, which, when touched by the
convalescent Mr. Bode, throttled him instantly.
“St. Mungo’s is as yet unable to account for the presence of the plant
on the ward and asks any witch or wizard with information to come
forward.”
“Bode . . .” said Ron. “
Bode. 
It rings a bell . . .”
“We saw him,” Hermione whispered. “In St. Mungo’s, remember? He was
in the bed opposite Lockhart’s, just lying there, staring at the ceiling. And we
saw the Devil’s Snare arrive. She — the Healer — said it was a Christmas
present . . .”
Harry looked back at the story. A feeling of horror was rising like bile in
his throat.“How come we didn’t recognize Devil’s Snare . . . ? We’ve seen it
before . . . we could’ve stopped this from happening . . .”
“Who ex ill had some hope,
some resilience. . . .
And then, abruptly and shockingly amid the frozen silence, one of the
dungeon doors on the left of the corridor was flung open and screams echoed
out of it.
“No, no, I’m half-blood, I’m half-blood, I tell you! My father was a wizard,
he 
was,
 look him up, Arkie Alderton, he’s a well-known broomstick designer,
look him up, I tell you — get your hands off me, get your hands off —”
“This is your final warning,” said Umbridge’s soft voice, magically
magnified so that it sounded clearly over the man’s desperate screams. “If you
struggle, you will be subjected to the Dementor’s Kiss.”
The man’s screams subsided, but dry sobs echoed through the corridor.“Take him away,” said Umbridge.
Two dementors appeared in the doorway of the courtroom, their rotting,
scabbed hands clutching the upper arms of a wizard who appeared to be
fainting. They glided away down the corridor with him, and the darkness they
trailed behind them swallowed him from sight.
“Next — Mary Cattermole,” call , who had been injured in a workplace accident some
weeks prior to his death.
Healer Miriam Strout, who was in charge of Mr. Bode’s ward at the
time of the incident, has been suspended on full pay and was unavailable
for comment yesterday, but a spokeswizard for the hospital said in a
statement, “St. Mungo’s deeply regrets the death of Mr. Bode, whose
health was improving steadily prior to this tragic accident.
“We have strict guidelines on the decorations permitted on our wards
but it appears that Healer Strout, busy over the Christmas period,
overlooked the dangers of the plant on Mr. Bode’s bedside table. As his
speech and mobility improved, Healer Strout encouraged Mr. Bode to

“St. Mungo’s is as yet unable to account for the presence of the plant
on the ward and asks any witch or wizard with information to come

 ay, it fell back into its
deep sleep.
Harry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor. There was no
sign of the bottom.
He lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his
fingertips. Then he looked up at Ron and said, “If anything happens to me,
don’t follow. Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore,
right?”
“Right,” said Ron.
“See you in a minute, I hope. . . .”
And Harry let go. Cold, damp air rushed past him as he fell down, down,
down and —
FLUMP. With a funny, muffled sort of thump he landed on something soft.
He sat up and felt around, his eyes not used to the gloom. It felt as though he
was sitting on some sort of plant.
“It’s okay!” he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp, which was
the open trapdoor, “it’s a soft landing, you can jump!”
Ron followed right away. He landed, sprawled next to Harry.
“What’s this stuff?” were his first words.“Dunno, some sort of plant thing. I suppose it’s here to break the fall. Come
on, Hermione!”
The distant music stared at the thing. It was pulsating slightly, giving it the rather
sinister look of some diseased internal organ.
“It’s really, really rare,” said Neville, beaming. “I don’t know if there’s one
in the greenhouse at Hogwarts, even. I can’t wait to show it to Professor
Sprout. My great-uncle Algie got it for me in Assyria. I’m going to see if I
can breed from it.”
Harry knew that Neville’s favorite subject was Herbology, but for the life
of him he could not see what he would want with this stunted little plant.
“Does it — er — do anything?” he asked.
“Loads of stuff!” said Neville proudly. “It’s got an amazing defensive
mechanism — hold Trevor for me . . .”He dumped the toad into Harry’s lap and took a quill from his schoolbag.
Luna Lovegood’s popping eyes appeared over the top of her upside-down
magazine again, watching what Neville was doing. Neville held the 
Mimbulus
mimbletonia
 up to his eyes, his tongue between his teeth, chose his spot, and
gave the plant a sharp prod with the tip of his quill.

back of the sofa, jerked the gun out of Uncle Vernon’s hands, bent it into a
knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber, and threw it into a corner of
the room.
Uncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a mouse being trodden on.
“Anyway — Harry,” said the giant, turning his back on the Dursleys, “a
very happy birthday to yeh. Got summat fer yeh here — I mighta sat on it at
some point, but it’ll taste all right.”
From an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly squashed
box. Harry opened it with trembling fingers. Inside was a large, sticky
chocolate cake with 
Happy Birthday Harry
 written on it in green icing.
Harry looked up at the giant. He meant to say thank you, but the words got
lost on the way to his mouth, and what he said instead was, “Who are you?”
The giant chuckled.
“True, I haven’t introduced meself. Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and
Grounds at Hogwarts.”He held out an enormous hand and shook Harry’s whole arm.
“What about that te teeth, hoping against hope he wouldn’t — but it was
no good.
“Another half-giant, o’ course!” said Hagrid.
“’Ow dare you!” shrieked Madame Maxime. Her voice exploded through
the peaceful night air like a foghorn; behind him, Harry heard Fleur and
Roger fall out of their rosebush. “I ’ave nevair been more insulted in my life!
’Alf-giant? 
Moi?
 I ’ave — I ’ave big bones!”
She stormed away; great multicolored swarms of fairies rose into the air as
she passed, angrily pushing aside bushes. Hagrid was still sitting on the
bench, staring after her. It was much too dark to make out his expression.
Then, after about a minute, he stood up and strode away, not back to the
castle, but off out into the dark grounds in the direction of his cabin.
“C’mon,” Harry said, very quietly to Ron. “Let’s go. . . .”
But Ron didn’t move.
“What’s up?” said Harry, looking at him.
Ron looked around at Harry, his expression very serious indeed.
“Did you know?” he whispered. “About Hagrid being half-giant?”
“No,” Harry said, shrugging. “ under his weight, and
began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat: a copper kettle,
a squashy package of sausages, a poker, a teapot, several chipped mugs, and a
bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from before starting to make
tea. Soon the hut was full of the sound and smell of sizzling sausage. Nobody
said a thing while the giant was working, but as he slid the first six fat, juicy,
slightly burnt sausages from the poker, Dudley fidgeted a little. Uncle Vernon
said sharply, “Don’t touch anything he gives you, Dudley.”
The giant chuckled darkly.
“Yer great puddin’ of a son don’ need fattenin’ anymore, Dursley, don’
worry.”
He passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry he had never tasted
anything so wonderful, but he still couldn’t take his eyes off the giant. Finally,
as nobody seemed about to explain anything, he said, “I’m sorry, but I still
don’t really know who you are.”
The giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand.
“Call me Hagrid,” he  aked and ran to hide behind his mother, who was crouching,
terrified, behind Uncle Vernon.
“An’ here’s Harry!” said the giant.
Harry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face and saw that the beetle
eyes were crinkled in a smile.
“Las’ time I saw you, you was only a baby,” said the giant. “Yeh look a lot
like yer dad, but yeh’ve got yer mum’s eyes.”
Uncle Vernon made a funny rasping noise.
“I demand that you leave at once, sir!” he said. “You are breaking and
entering!”
“Ah, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune,” said the giant; he reached over the
back of the sofa, jerked the gun out of Uncle Vernon’s hands, bent it into a
knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber, and threw it into a corner of
the room.
Uncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a mouse being trodden on.

“True, I haven’t introduced meself. Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and

“What about that tea then, eh?” he said, rubbing his hands together. “I’d not
say no ter summat stronger if yeh’ve got it, mind.”
His eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags in it and he
snorted. He bent down over the fireplace; they couldn’t see what he was
doing but when he drew back a second later, there was a roaring fire there. It
filled the whole damp hut with flickering light and Harry felt the warmth
wash over him as though he’d sunk into a hot bath.
The giant sat back down on the sofa, which sagged   “Don’t touch anything he gives you, Dudley.”
The giant chuckled darkly.
“Yer great puddin’ of a son don’ need fattenin’ anymore, Dursley, don’

He passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry he had never tasted

The giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand.
“Call me Hagrid,” he said, “everyone does. An’ like I told yeh, I’m Keeper
of Keys at Hogwarts — yeh’ll know all about Hogwarts, o’ course.”
“Er — no,” said Harry.
Hagrid looked shocked.
“Sorry,” Harry said quickly.
“Sorry?”
 barked Hagrid, turning to stare at the Dursleys, who shrank backinto the shadows. “It’s them as should be sorry! I knew yeh weren’t gettin’ yer
letters but I never thought yeh wouldn’t even know abou’ Hogwarts, fer cryin’
out loud! Did yeh never wonder where yer parents learned it all?”
“All what?” asked H he spells bounced off him?”
“It’ll be his giant blood,” said Hermione shakily. “It’s very hard to Stun a
giant, they’re like trolls, really tough. . . . But poor Professor McGonagall. . . .
Four Stunners straight in the chest, and she’s not exactly young, is she?”
“Dreadful, dreadful,” said Ernie, shaking his head pompously. “Well, I’m
off to bed . . . ’Night, all . . .”
People around them were drifting away, still talking excitedly about what
they had just seen.
“At least they didn’t get to take Hagrid off to Azkaban,” said Ron. “I ’spect
he’s gone to join Dumbledore, hasn’t he?”
“I suppose so,” said Hermione, who looked tearful. “Oh, this is awful, I
really thought Dumbledore would be back before long, but now we’ve lost
Hagrid too . . .”
They traipsed back to the Gryffindor common room to find it full. The
commotion out in the grounds had woken several people, who had hastened to
rouse their friends. Seamus and Dean, who had arrived ahead of Harry, Ron,
and Hermione, were now telling everyone what they had dst of
the spider swarm, but as he made to chase after them, his way was impeded
by a monumental foot, which swung down out of the darkness and made the
ground on which he stood shudder. He looked up: A giant stood before him,twenty feet high, its head hidden in shadow, nothing but its treelike, hairy
shins illuminated by light from the castle doors. With one brutal, fluid
movement, it smashed a massive fist through an upper window, and glass
rained down upon Harry, forcing him back under the shelter of the doorway.
“Oh my — !” shrieked Hermione, as she and Ron caught up with Harry and
gazed upward at the giant now trying to seize people through the window
above.
“DON’T!” Ron yelled, grabbing Hermione’s hand as she raised her wand.
“Stun him and he’ll crush half the castle —”
“HAGGER?”
Grawp came lurching around the corner of the castle; only now did Harry
realize that Grawp was, indeed, an undersized giant. The gargantuan monster
trying to crush people on the upper floors looked around and let out a roar.

voice.
“You produced a fully fledged Patronus?”
“Yes,” said Harry, “because —”

“A — what?” said Harry.“Your Patronus had a clearly defined form? I mean to say, it was more than
vapor or smoke?”
“Yes,” said Harry, feeling both impatient and slightly desperate, “it’s a stag,
it’s always a stag.”
“Always?” boomed Madam Bones. “You have produced a Patronus before
now?”
“Yes,”
 said Harry, “I’ve been doing it for over a year —”
“And you are fifteen years old?”
“Yes, and —”
“You learned this at school?”
“Yes, Professor Lupin taught me in my third year, because of the —”
“Impressive,” said Madam Bones, staring down at him, “a true Patronus at
that age . . . very impressive indeed.”
Some of the wizards and witches around her were muttering again; a few
nodded, but others were frowning and shaking their heads.
“It’s not a question of how impressive the magic was,” sai Hex. I shall 
tell
 you once we’ve finished
checking it. Now, please stop badgering me.”
To make matters even worse, Harry’s anti-dementor lessons were not going
nearly as well as he had hoped. Several sessions on, he was able to produce an
indistinct, silvery shadow every time the boggart-dementor approached him,
but his Patronus was too feeble to drive the dementor away. All it did was
hover, like a semi-transparent cloud, draining Harry of energy as he fought to
keep it there. Harry felt angry with himself, guilty about his secret desire to
hear his parents’ voices again.
“You’re expecting too much of yourself,” said Professor Lupin sternly in
their fourth week of practice. “For a thirteen-year-old wizard, even an
indistinct Patronus is a huge achievement. You aren’t passing out anymore,
are you?”
“I thought a Patronus would — charge the dementors down or something,”
said Harry dispiritedly. “Make them disappear —”“The true Patronus does do that,” said Lupin. “But you’ve achieved a great

“You received an official warning from the Ministry for using illegal magic

“Yes, but —”

“You said it’s harder if there are loads of them,” said Harry.
“I have complete confidence in you,” said Lupin, smiling. “Here — you’ve
earned a drink — something from the Three Broomsticks. You won’t have
tried it before —”
He pulled two bottles out of his briefcase.
“Butterbeer!” said Harry, without thinking. “Yeah, I like that stuff!”
Lupin rai ctly, it conjures up a Patronus,” said Lupin,
“which is a kind of anti-dementor — a guardian that acts as a shield between
you and the dementor.”
Harry had a sudden vision of himself crouching behind a Hagrid-sized
figure holding a large club. Professor Lupin continued, “The Patronus is a
kind of positive force, a projection of the very things that the dementor feeds
upon — hope, happiness, the desire to survive — but it cannot feel despair, as
real humans can, so the dementors can’t hurt it. But I must warn you, Harry,
that the charm might be too advanced for you. Many qualified wizards have
difficulty with it.”
“What does a Patronus look like?” said Harry curiously.
“Each one is unique to the wizard who conjures it.”
“And how do you conjure it?”“With an incantation, which will work only if you are concentrating, with
all your might, on a single, very happy memory.”
Harry cast his mind about for a happy memory. Certainly, nothing that had
happened to him at the Dursleys’ was going to do. Finally, he settled  a cupboard under my desk he’ll like.”
“Okay,” said Harry, trying to sound as though he wasn’t apprehensive at all
and merely glad that Lupin had found such a good substitute for a real
dementor.
“So . . .” Professor Lupin had taken out his own wand, and indicated that
Harry should do the same. “The spell I am going to try and teach you is
highly advanced magic, Harry — well beyond Ordinary Wizarding Level. It
is called the Patronus Charm.”
“How does it work?” said Harry nervously.
“Well, when it works correctly, it conjures up a Patronus,” said Lupin,

“So,” said Hermione, her voice very high-pitched again. “So . . . like I wassaying . . . if you want to learn some defense, then we need to work out how
we’re going to do it, how often we’re going to meet, and where we’re going

“Is it true,” interrupted the girl with the long plait down her back, looking
at Harry, “that you can produce a Patronus?”
There was a murmur of interest around the group at this.
“Yeah,” said Harry slightly defensively.
“A corporeal Patronus?”
The phrase stirred something in Harry’s memory.
“Er — you don’t know Madam Bones, do you?” he asked.
The girl smiled.
“She’s my auntie,” she said. “I’m Susan Bones. She told me about your

“Mum told Ron not to spread it around,” said Fred, grinning at Harry. “She
said you got enough attention as it was.”
“She’s not wrong,” mumbled Harry and a couple of people laughed. The
veiled witch sitting alone shifted very slightly in her seat.
“And did you kill a basilisk with that sword in Dumbledore’s office?”
demanded Terry Boot. “That’s what one of the portraits on the wall told me
when I was in there last year . . .”

Dumbledore, smiling. “An extraordinary achievement — not least, keeping it

blurred to resemble neon lines as the wall sped around and then, quite as
suddenly as it had started, the rumbling stopped and everything became

Harry’s eyes had blue streaks burned into them; it was all he could see.
“What was that about?” whispered Ron fearfully.
“I think it was to stop us knowing which door we came in from,” said
Ginny in a hushed voice.
Harry realized at once that she was right: He could no sooner have picked
the exit from the other doors than located an ant upon the jet-black floor.
Meanwhile, the door through which they needed to proceed could be any of
the dozen surrounding them.
“How’re we going to get back out?” said Neville uncomfortably.“Well, that doesn’t matter now,” said Harry forcefully, blinking to try and

“Don’t go calling for him, though!” Hermione said urgently, but Harry had
never needed her advice less; his instinct was to keep as quiet as possible for
the time being.
“Where do we go, then, Harry?” Ron asked.
“I don’t —” Harry began. He swallowed. “In the dreams I went through the
door at the end of the corridor from the lifts into a dark room — that’s this
one — and then I went through another door into a room that kind of . . .

buzzing, so that lengthy conversations could be held in class without being
overheard. The only person who did not find these charms amusing was
Hermione, who maintained a rigidly disapproving expression throughout and
refused to talk at all if Harry had used the 
Muffliato

vicinity.

closely the scribbled instructions for a spell that seemed to have caused the
Prince some trouble. There were many crossings-out and alterations, but
finally, crammed into a corner of the page, the scribble:

What memories . . . Dudley puked on it after I saved him from the
dementors. . . . Turns out he was grateful after all, can you believe it? . . . And
last summer, Dumbledore walked through that front door. . . .”
Harry lost the thread of his thoughts for a moment and Hedwig did nothing
to help him retrieve it, but continued to sit with her head under her wing.
Harry turned his back on the front door.
“And under here, Hedwig” — Harry pulled open a door under the stairs —
“is where I used to sleep! You never knew me then — Blimey, it’s small, I’d
forgotten. . . .”
Harry looked around at the stacked shoes and umbrellas, remembering how
he used to wake every morning looking up at the underside of the staircase,
which was more often than not adorned with a spider or two. Those had been
the days before he had known anything about his true identity; before he had
found out how his parents had died or why such strange things often
happened around him. But Harry could still remembe e. . . .
“Harry,” said Hermione, “how can you still stick up for that book when that
spell 
—”
“Will you stop harping on about the book!” snapped Harry. “The Prince
only copied it out! It’s not like he was advising anyone to use it! For all we
know, he was making a note of something that had been used against him!”
“I don’t believe this,” said Hermione. “You’re actually defending —”
“I’m not defending what I did!” said Harry quickly. “I wish I hadn’t done
it, and not just because I’ve got about a dozen detentions. You know I
wouldn’t’ve used a spell like that, not even on Malfoy, but you can’t blame
the Prince, he hadn’t written ‘try this out, it’s really good’ — he was just
making notes for himself, wasn’t he, not for anyone else. . . .”
“Are you telling me,” said Hermione, “that you’re going to go back — ?”
“And get the book? Yeah, I am,” said Harry forcefully. “Listen, without the
Prince I’d never have won the Felix Felicis. I’d never have known how to
save Ron from poisoning, I’d never have —”

not complaining or anything” — he got gingerly to his feet, rubbing his
backside — “but I’m aching all over. . . .”
“Well, you keep missing the cushions, don’t you!” said Hermione
impatiently, rearranging the pile of cushions they had used for the Banishing
Spell, which Flitwick had left in a cabinet. “Just try and fall backward!”“Once you’re Stunned, you can’t aim too well, Hermione!” said Ron
angrily. “Why don’t you take a turn?”

mean “nonverbal.” Harry rather doubted he would be able to bring off this
particular spell; he was still having difficulty with nonverbal spells,
something Snape had been quick to comment on in every D.A.D.A. class. On
the other hand, the Prince had proved a much more effective teacher than
Snape so far.
Pointing his wand at nothing in particular, he gave it an upward flick and
said 
Levicorp us,

House. Very cheeky answers I used to get back too.”
“Which was your House?”

seeing the expression on Harry’s face and wagging a stubby finger at him,
“don’t go holding that against me! You’ll be Gryffindor like her, I suppose?
Yes, it usually goes in families. Not always, though. Ever heard of Sirius
Black? You must have done — been in the papers for the last couple of years

It was as though an invisible hand had twisted Harry’s intestines and held
them tight.
“Well, anyway, he was a big pal of your father’s at school. The whole
Black family had been in my House, but Sirius ended up in Gryffindor!
Shame — he was a talented boy. I got his brother, Regulus, when he came
along, but I’d have liked the set.”
He sounded like an enthusiastic collector who had been outbid at auction.

Who is the head of Hufflepuff House?,Pomona Sprout,"According to the text, the head of Hufflepuff House is not explicitly mentioned. However, it is mentioned that everyone says Hufflepuffs are ""a lot o' duffers"", implying that the House is not considered as prestigious as other Houses, such as Gryffindor or Slytherin."," you are here, your House will be something like
your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your
House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free time in your House
common room.
“The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and
Slytherin. Each House has its own noble history and each has produced
outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs
will earn your House points, while any rule-breaking will lose House points.
At the end of the year, the House with the most points is awarded the House
Cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever House
becomes yours.

They bought Harry’s school books in a shop called Flourish and Blotts
where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as paving
stones bound in leather; books the size of postage stamps in covers of silk;
books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with nothing in them at all.
Even Dudley, who never read anything, would have been wild to get his
hands on some of these. Hagrid almost had to drag Harry away from 
Curses
and Counter-curses  rom a doorway to the right — the
rest of the school must already be here — but Professor McGonagall showed
the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in,
standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering
about nervously.
“Welcome to Hogwarts,” said Professor McGonagall. “The start-of-term
banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall,
you will be sorted into your Houses. The Sorting is a very importantceremony because, while you are here, your House will be something like
your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your
House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free time in your House
common room.
“The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and
Slytherin. Each House has its own noble history and each has produced
outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs
will earn your House points, while any rule-breaking will lose House points.
At the end of the s glory; a feeling exacerbated, perhaps,
by the fact that Hufflepuff House very rarely got any glory, and that Cedric
was one of the few who had ever given them any, having beaten Gryffindor
once at Quidditch. Ernie Macmillan and Justin Finch-Fletchley, with whom
Harry normally got on very well, did not talk to him even though they were
repotting Bouncing Bulbs at the same tray — 
though they did laugh rather
unpleasantly when one of the Bouncing Bulbs wriggled free from Harry’s grip
and smacked him hard in the face. Ron wasn’t talking to Harry either.
Hermione sat between them, making very forced conversation, but though
both answered her normally, they avoided making eye contact with each
other. Harry thought even Professor Sprout seemed distant with him — 
but
then, she was Head of Hufflepuff House.
He would have been looking forward to seeing Hagrid under normal
circumstances, but Care of Magical Creatures meant seeing the Slytherins too
— 
the first time he would come face-to-face with them since becomin him most nights
with stupid dreams about the exams. He also suspected that part of his mind
— the part that often spoke in Hermione’s voice — now felt guilty on the
occasions it strayed down that corridor ending in the black door, and sought to
wake him before he could reach journey’s end.
“You know,” said Ron, whose ears were still flaming red, “if Montague
doesn’t recover before Slytherin play Hufflepuff, we might be in with a
chance of winning the Cup.”
“Yeah, I s’pose so,” said Harry, glad of a change of subject.
“I mean, we’ve won one, lost one — if Slytherin lose to Hufflepuff next
Saturday —”
“Yeah, that’s right,” said Harry, losing track of what he was agreeing to:
Cho Chang had just walked across the courtyard, determinedly not looking at
him.
The final match of the Quidditch season, Gryffindor versus Ravenclaw, was
to take place on the last weekend of May. Although Slytherin had been
narrowly defeated by Hufflepuff in their last match, Gryffindor was not
daring to hope for victory, due mainly (thoug “Diggory got the Snitch,” said George. “Just after you fell. He didn’t
realize what had happened. When he looked back and saw you on the ground,
he tried to call it off. Wanted a rematch. But they won fair and square . . .
even Wood admits it.”
“Where is Wood?” said Harry, suddenly realizing he wasn’t there.
“Still in the showers,” said Fred. “We think he’s trying to drown himself.”
Harry put his face to his knees, his hands gripping his hair. Fred grabbed
his shoulder and shook it roughly.
“C’mon, Harry, you’ve never missed the Snitch before.”
“There had to be one time you didn’t get it,” said George.
“It’s not over yet,” said Fred. “We lost by a hundred points, right? So if
Hufflepuff loses to Ravenclaw and we beat Ravenclaw and Slytherin . . .”
“Hufflepuff’ll have to lose by at least two hundred points,” said George.
“But if they beat Ravenclaw . . .”
“No way, Ravenclaw is too good. But if Slytherin loses against
Hufflepuff . . .”“It all depends on the points — a margin of a hundred either way —”
Harry lay nde hair, and swept
up between the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables.
“Oh look, they’re all disappointed,” Hermione said over the noise, nodding
toward the remainder of the Beauxbatons party. “Disappointed” was a bit of
an understatement, Harry thought. Two of the girls who had not been selected
had dissolved into tears and were sobbing with their heads on their arms.
When Fleur Delacour too had vanished into the side chamber, silence fell
again, but this time it was a silence so stiff with excitement you could almost
taste it. The Hogwarts champion next . . .
And the Goblet of Fire turned red once more; sparks showered out of it; the
tongue of flame shot high into the air, and from its tip Dumbledore pulled the
third piece of parchment.
“The Hogwarts champion,” he called, “is Cedric Diggory!”
“No!” said Ron loudly, but nobody heard him except Harry; the uproar
from the next table was too great. Every single Hufflepuff had jumped to his
or her feet, screaming and stamping, as Cedric made his way past them,
grin"
What creature is Buckbeak?,Hippogriff,Buckbeak is a Hippogriff.,"demned, shall
be executed on the sixth of June at sundown —”
Careful not to blink, Harry stared up into Buckbeak’s fierce orange eyes
once more and bowed. Buckbeak sank to his scaly knees and then stood up
again. Harry began to fumble with the knot of rope tying Buckbeak to the
fence.
“. . . sentenced to execution by beheading, to be carried out by the
Committee’s appointed executioner, Walden Macnair . . .”
“Come on, Buckbeak,” Harry murmured, “come on, we’re going to help
you. Quietly . . . quietly . . .”
“ . . . 
as witnessed below.
 Hagrid, you sign here. . . .”
Harry threw all his weight onto the rope, but Buckbeak had dug in his front
feet.
“Well, let’s get this over with,” said the reedy voice of the Committee
member from inside Hagrid’s cabin. “Hagrid, perhaps it will be better if you
stay inside —”
“No, I — I wan’ ter be with him. . . . I don’ wan’ him ter be alone —”
Footsteps echoed from within the cabin.“Buckbeak, move!”
 Harry hissed.
Harry tugged harder on the rope around Buckbeak’s neck. The hi ing flat on his back with his arms and legs in the
air, gave Harry one upside-down look of deepest loathing and, with another
loud crack, vanished.
“Good,” said Dumbledore. “There is also the matter of the hippogriff,
Buckbeak. Hagrid has been looking after him since Sirius died, but Buckbeak
is yours now, so if you would prefer to make different arrangements —”
“No,” said Harry at once, “he can stay with Hagrid. I think Buckbeak
would prefer that.”
“Hagrid will be delighted,” said Dumbledore, smiling. “He was thrilled to
see Buckbeak again. Incidentally, we have decided, in the interests of
Buckbeak’s safety, to rechristen him ‘Witherwings’ for the time being, though
I doubt that the Ministry would ever guess he is the hippogriff they once
sentenced to death. Now, Harry, is your trunk packed?”
“Erm . . .”
“Doubtful that I would turn up?” Dumbledore suggested shrewdly.
“I’ll just go and — er — finish off,” said Harry hastily, hurrying to pick up
his fallen telescope and trainers.
It took him a little over ten ve her a leg up.
Then he placed his foot on one of the lower branches of the bush and climbed
up in front of her. He pulled Buckbeak’s rope back over his neck and tied it to
the other side of his collar like reins.
“Ready?” he whispered to Hermione. “You’d better hold on to me —”
He nudged Buckbeak’s sides with his heels.
Buckbeak soared straight into the dark air. Harry gripped his flanks with his
knees, feeling the great wings rising powerfully beneath them. Hermione was
holding Harry very tight around the waist; he could hear her muttering, “Oh,
no — I don’t like this — oh, I 
really
 don’t like this —”
Harry urged Buckbeak forward. They were gliding quietly toward the
upper floors of the castle. . . . Harry pulled hard on the left-hand side of the
rope, and Buckbeak turned. Harry was trying to count the windows flashing
past —
“Whoa!” he said, pulling backward as hard as he could.
Buckbeak slowed down and they found themselves at a stop, unless you
counted the fact that they kept rising up and down severa d. I’ll
make it quick. And then you and Macnair need to sign it. Macnair, you’re
supposed to listen too, that’s procedure —”
Macnair’s face vanished from the window. It was now or never.
“Wait here,” Harry whispered to Hermione. “I’ll do it.”
As Fudge’s voice started again, Harry darted out from behind his tree,
vaulted the fence into the pumpkin patch, and approached Buckbeak.
“It is the decision of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous
Creatures that the hippogriff Buckbeak, hereafter called the condemned, shall
be executed on the sixth of June at sundown —”
Careful not to blink, Harry stared up into Buckbeak’s fierce orange eyes
once more and bowed. Buckbeak sank to his scaly knees and then stood up
again. Harry began to fumble with the knot of rope tying Buckbeak to the
fence.
“. . . sentenced to execution by beheading, to be carried out by the
Committee’s appointed executioner, Walden Macnair . . .”
“Come on, Buckbeak,” Harry murmured, “come on, we’re going to help
you. Quietly . . . quietly . . .” behind Hermione.
“Okay, Buckbeak, up!” said Harry, shaking the rope. “Up to the tower —
come on!”
The hippogriff gave one sweep of its mighty wings and they were soaring
upward again, high as the top of the West Tower. Buckbeak landed with a
clatter on the battlements, and Harry and Hermione slid off him at once.
“Sirius, you’d better go, quick,” Harry panted. “They’ll reach Flitwick’s
office any moment, they’ll find out you’re gone.”
Buckbeak pawed the ground, tossing his sharp head.
“What happened to the other boy? Ron?” croaked Sirius.
“He’s going to be okay. He’s still out of it, but Madam Pomfrey says she’ll
be able to make him better. Quick — go —”
But Black was still staring down at Harry.
“How can I ever thank —”
“GO!” Harry and Hermione shouted together.
Black wheeled Buckbeak around, facing the open sky.
“We’ll see each other again,” he said. “You are — truly your father’s son,Harry. . . .”
He squeezed Buckbeak’s sides with his heels. Harry and Hermione jumped
back as the enormous wings rose once mo 
“How — how — ?” said Black weakly, staring at the hippogriff.
“Get on — there’s not much time,” said Harry, gripping Buckbeak firmly
on either side of his sleek neck to hold him steady. “You’ve got to get out of
here — the dementors are coming — Macnair’s gone to get them.”
Black placed a hand on either side of the window frame and heaved his
head and shoulders out of it. It was very lucky he was so thin. In seconds, he
had managed to fling one leg over Buckbeak’s back and pull himself onto the
hippogriff behind Hermione.
“Okay, Buckbeak, up!” said Harry, shaking the rope. “Up to the tower —
come on!”
The hippogriff gave one sweep of its mighty wings and they were soaring
upward again, high as the top of the West Tower. Buckbeak landed with a
clatter on the battlements, and Harry and Hermione slid off him at once.
“Sirius, you’d better go, quick,” Harry panted. “They’ll reach Flitwick’s
office any moment, they’ll find out you’re gone.”
Buckbeak pawed the ground, tossing his sharp head.
“What happened to the   frightened. Harry could not see
why. The hall was quite empty but for themselves, the sobbing Bellatrix still
trapped under her statue, and the tiny baby Fawkes croaking feebly on the
floor —
And then Harry’s scar burst open. He knew he was dead: it was pain
beyond imagining, pain past endurance —
He was gone from the hall, he was locked in the coils of a creature with red
eyes, so tightly bound that Harry did not know where his body ended and the
creature’s began. They were fused together, bound by pain, and there was no
escape —
And when the creature spoke, it used Harry’s mouth, so that in his agony he
felt his jaw move. . . .
“Kill me now, Dumbledore . . .”
Blinded and dying, every part of him screaming for release, Harry felt the
creature use him again. . . .
“If death is nothing, Dumbledore, kill the boy . . .”Let the pain stop,
 thought Harry. 
Let him kill us. . . . End it,
Dumbledore. . . . Death is nothing compared to this. . . .
And I’ll see Sirius again. . . .
And as Harry’s heart filled with emo y, Ron, and
Hermione whip around. Buckbeak the hippogriff was lying in the corner,
chomping on something that was oozing blood all over the floor.
“I couldn’ leave him tied up out there in the snow!” choked Hagrid. “All on
his own! At Christmas.”
Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another. They had never seen eye
to eye with Hagrid about what he called “interesting creatures” and other
people called “terrifying monsters.” On the other hand, there didn’t seem to
be any particular harm in Buckbeak. In fact, by Hagrid’s usual standards, he
was positively cute.
“You’ll have to put up a good strong defense, Hagrid,” said Hermione,
sitting down and laying a hand on Hagrid’s massive forearm. “I’m sure you
can prove Buckbeak is safe.”
“Won’t make no diff’rence!” sobbed Hagrid. “Them Disposal devils,
they’re all in Lucius Malfoy’s pocket! Scared o’ him! An’ if I lose the case,
Buckbeak —”
Hagrid drew his finger swiftly across his throat, then gave a great wail and
lurched forward, his face in his arms.
“What about"
Who is the founder of Gryffindor House?,Godric Gryffindor,"According to the text, the founder of Gryffindor House is not explicitly mentioned. However, we can infer that the founders of all four Houses (Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin) are mentioned in the context of Hermione's discussion with Harry about Voldemort's attempt to find a founder's object to make into another Horcrux.","” inquired
Ron. He was tugging at the chain of the Horcrux around his neck: Harry was
visited by a desire to seize it and throttle him.
“You told us that You-Know-Who asked Dumbledore to give him a job
after he left,” said Hermione.
“That’s right,” said Harry.
“And Dumbledore thought he only wanted to come back to try and find
something, probably another founder’s object, to make into another
Horcrux?”
“Yeah,” said Harry.
“But he didn’t get the job, did he?” said Hermione. “So he never got the
chance to find a founder’s object there and hide it in the school!”
“Okay, then,” said Harry, defeated. “Forget Hogwarts.”
Without any other leads, they traveled into London and, hidden beneath the
Invisibility Cloak, searched for the orphanage in which Voldemort had been
raised. Hermione stole into a library and discovered from their records that
the place had been demolished many years before. They visited its site and
found a tower block of offices.
“We could try digging in the foundations?” Hermione suggested
halfhe  you are here, your House will be something like
your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your
House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free time in your House

“The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and
Slytherin. Each House has its own noble history and each has produced
outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs
will earn your House points, while any rule-breaking will lose House points.
At the end of the year, the House with the most points is awarded the House
Cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever House
becomes yours.
“The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest
of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can
while you are waiting.”
Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville’s cloak, which was fastened
under his left ear, and on Ron’s smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to
flatten his hair.
“I shall return when we are r was in Dumbledore’s office,
knowing he would shortly be telling him about the dream. Harry looked up at
the walls behind the desk. The patched and ragged Sorting Hat was standing
on a shelf. A glass case next to it held a magnificent silver sword with large
rubies set into the hilt, which Harry recognized as the one he himself had
pulled out of the Sorting Hat in his second year. The sword had once belonged
to Godric Gryffindor, founder of Harry’s House. He was gazing at it,
remembering how it had come to his aid when he had thought all hope was
lost, when he noticed a patch of silvery light, dancing and shimmering on the
glass case. He looked around for the source of the light and saw a sliver of
silver-white shining brightly from within a black cabinet behind him, whose
door had not been closed properly. Harry hesitated, glanced at Fawkes, then
got up, walked across the office, and pulled open the cabinet door.A shallow stone basin lay there, with odd carvings around the edge: runes
and symbols that Harry d  Professor Dumbledore’s phoenix, was standing on his golden
perch beside the door. The size of a swan, with magnificent scarlet-and-gold
plumage, he swished his long tail and blinked benignly at Harry.
Harry sat down in a chair in front of Dumbledore’s desk. For several
minutes, he sat and watched the old headmasters and headmistresses snoozing
in their frames, thinking about what he had just heard, and running his fingers
over his scar. It had stopped hurting now.
He felt much calmer, somehow, now that he was in Dumbledore’s office,
knowing he would shortly be telling him about the dream. Harry looked up at
the walls behind the desk. The patched and ragged Sorting Hat was standing
on a shelf. A glass case next to it held a magnificent silver sword with large
rubies set into the hilt, which Harry recognized as the one he himself had
pulled out of the Sorting Hat in his second year. The sword had once belonged
to Godric Gryffindor, founder of Harry’s House. He was gazing at it,
remembering how it had come to h he was a wizard, that he refused my company on a trip to Diagon
Alley, and that I, in turn, warned him against continued thievery when he
arrived at school.
“Well, the start of the school year arrived and with it came Tom Riddle, a
quiet boy in his secondhand robes, who lined up with the other first years to
be sorted. He was placed in Slytherin House almost the moment that the
Sorting Hat touched his head,” continued Dumbledore, waving his blackened
hand toward the shelf over his head where the Sorting Hat sat, ancient and
unmoving. “How soon Riddle learned that the famous founder of the House
could talk to snakes, I do not know — perhaps that very evening. The
knowledge can only have excited him and increased his sense of self-
importance.
“However, if he was frightening or impressing fellow Slytherins with
displays of Parseltongue in their common room, no hint of it reached the staff.
He showed no sign of outward arrogance or aggression at all. As an unusually
talented and very good-looking orphan, he natu id in front of me that he never assumed he knew all of
Hogwarts’s secrets. I’m telling you, if there was one place Vol —”
“Oi!”
“YOU-KNOW-WHO, then!” Harry shouted, goaded past endurance. “If
there was one place that was really important to You-Know-Who, it was
Hogwarts!”
“Oh, come on,” scoffed Ron. “His 
school
?”“Yeah, his school! It was his first real home, the place that meant he was
special; it meant everything to him, and even after he left —”
“This is You-Know-Who we’re talking about, right? Not you?” inquired
Ron. He was tugging at the chain of the Horcrux around his neck: Harry was
visited by a desire to seize it and throttle him.
“You told us that You-Know-Who asked Dumbledore to give him a job
after he left,” said Hermione.
“That’s right,” said Harry.
“And Dumbledore thought he only wanted to come back to try and find
something, probably another founder’s object, to make into another
Horcrux?”
“Yeah,” said Harry.
“But he didn’t get the job, did he?” said Hermione. “So he never got the
chance to fin  he looked like a radish with a bad sunburn.
“. . . for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years, I
award Gryffindor House fifty points.”
Gryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; the stars overhead
seemed to quiver. Percy could be heard telling the other prefects, “My
brother, you know! My youngest brother! Got past McGonagall’s giant chess
set!”
At last there was silence again.
“Second — to Miss Hermione Granger . . . for the use of cool logic in the
face of fire, I award Gryffindor House fifty points.”
Hermione buried her face in her arms; Harry strongly suspected she hadburst into tears. Gryffindors up and down the table were beside themselves —
they were a hundred points up.
“Third — to Mr. Harry Potter . . .” said Dumbledore. The room went
deadly quiet. “. . . for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor
House sixty points.”
The din was deafening. Those who could add up while yelling themselves
hoarse knew that Gryffindor now had four hundred and seventy-t rom a doorway to the right — the
rest of the school must already be here — but Professor McGonagall showed
the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in,
standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering
about nervously.

“Yeah, we don’t need to hear about you being in love with Malfoy,” Harry
told Kreacher. “Let’s fast forward to where he’s actually been going.”
Kreacher bowed again, looking furious, and then said, “Master Malfoy eats

classes in a variety of —”
“Dobby, you tell me,” said Harry, cutting across Kreacher. “Has he been

firelight, “the Malfoy boy is breaking no rules that Dobby can discover, but
he is still keen to avoid detection. He has been making regular visits to the
seventh floor with a variety of other students, who keep watch for him while
he enters —”“The Room of Requirement!” said Harry, smacking himself hard on the
forehead with

because he found out his wife was a witch? No, Harry — I fashioned myself a
new name, a name I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak,when I had become the greatest sorcerer in the world!”
Harry’s brain seemed to have jammed. He stared numbly at Riddle, at the
orphaned boy who had grown up to murder Harry’s own parents, and so many
others. . . . At last he forced himself to speak.
“You’re not,” he said, his quiet voice full of hatred.
“Not what?” snapped Riddle.
“Not the greatest sorcerer in the world,” said Harry, breathing fast. “Sorry

not entirely unexpected, caught him around the middle and held him fast. For
a few seconds Dobby struggled, then went limp.
“Thank you, Harry Potter,” he panted. “Dobby still finds it difficult to
speak ill of his old masters. . . .”
Harry released him; Dobby straightened his tea cozy and said defiantly to
Kreacher, “But Kreacher should know that Draco Malfoy is not a good master
to a house-elf!”
“Yeah, we don’t need to hear about you being in love with Malfoy,” Harry
told Kreacher. “Let’s fast forward to where he’s actually been going.”
Kreacher bowed again, looking furious, and then said, “Master Malfoy eats

“Dobby, you tell me,” said Harry, cutting across Kreacher. “Has he been

“Sorry,” said Harry quickly. “I know lots of people don’t like it. My friend
Ron —”
He stopped again. Thinking about Ron was painful, too.
Dobby leaned toward Harry, his eyes wide as headlights.
“Dobby heard tell,” he said hoarsely, “that Harry Potter met the Dark Lord
for a second time, just weeks ago . . . that Harry Potter escaped 
yet again.
”
Harry nodded and Dobby’s eyes suddenly shone with tears.
“Ah, sir,” he gasped, dabbing his face with a corner of the grubby
pillowcase he was wearing. “Harry Potter is valiant and bold! He has braved
so many dangers already! But Dobby has come to protect Harry Potter, to
warn him, even if he 
does
 have to shut his ears in the oven door later. . . .
Harry Potter must not go back to Hogwarts.
”
There was a silence broken only by the chink of knives and forks from
downstairs and the distant rumble of Uncle Vernon’s voice.
“W-what?” Harry stammered. “But I’ve got to go back — term starts on
September first. It’s all th zard
of all time? How did 
you
 escape with nothing but a scar, while Lord
Voldemort’s powers were destroyed?”
There was an odd red gleam in his hungry eyes now.
“Why do you care how I escaped?” said Harry slowly. “Voldemort was
after your time. . . .”
“Voldemort,” said Riddle softly, “is my past, present, and future, Harry
Potter. . . .”
He pulled Harry’s wand from his pocket and began to trace it through the
air, writing three shimmering words:
TOM MARVOLO RIDDLE
Then he waved the wand once, and the letters of his name rearranged
themselves:

THE BOY WHO LIVED
r. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say
that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much ight fell on Hermione instead.
“Wait,” said Narcissa sharply. “Yes — yes, she was in Madam Malkin’s
with Potter! I saw her picture in the 
Prophet
! Look, Draco, isn’t it the Granger
girl?”
“I . . . maybe . . . yeah.”“But then, that’s the Weasley boy!” shouted Lucius, striding around the
bound prisoners to face Ron. “It’s them, Potter’s friends — Draco, look at
him, isn’t it Arthur Weasley’s son, what’s his name — ?”
“Yeah,” said Draco again, his back to the prisoners. “It could be.”
The drawing room door opened behind Harry. A woman spoke, and the
sound of the voice wound Harry’s fear to an even higher pitch.
“What is this? What’s happened, Cissy?”
Bellatrix Lestrange walked slowly around the prisoners, and stopped on
Harry’s right, staring at Hermione through her heavily lidded eyes.
“But surely,” she said quietly, “this is the Mudblood girl? This is Granger?”
“Yes, yes, it’s Granger!” cried Lucius. “And beside her, we think, Potter!
Potter and his friends, caught at last!”
“Potter?” shrieked Bellatrix, and f the grubby
pillowcase he was wearing. “Harry Potter is valiant and bold! He has braved
so many dangers already! But Dobby has come to protect Harry Potter, to
warn him, even if he 
does
 have to shut his ears in the oven door later. . . .
Harry Potter must not go back to Hogwarts.
