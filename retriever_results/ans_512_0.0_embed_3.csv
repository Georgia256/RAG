“Sorry, Professor —”
“I’ve just been looking for you in the Gryffindor common room. Well, here
it is, we’ve done everything we could think of, and there doesn’t seem to be
anything wrong with it at all. You’ve got a very good friend somewhere,Potter. . . .”
Harry’s jaw dropped. She was holding out his Firebolt, and it looked as
magnificent as ever.
“I can have it back?” Harry said weakly. “Seriously?”
“Seriously,” said Professor McGonagall, and she was actually smiling. “I

adult Voldemort is the same. You will hear many of his Death Eaters claiming
that they are in his confidence, that they alone are close to him, even

nor do I believe that he has ever wanted one.
“And lastly — I hope you are not too sleepy to pay attention to this, Harry
— the young Tom Riddle liked to collect trophies. You saw the box of stolen
articles he py birthday to me . . .”
No cards, no presents, and he would be spending the evening pretending
not to exist. He gazed miserably into the hedge. He had never felt so lonely.
More than anything else at Hogwarts, more even than playing Quidditch,
Harry missed his best friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. They,
however, didn’t seem to be missing him at all. Neither of them had written to
him all summer, even though Ron had said he was going to ask Harry to come
and stay.
Countless times, Harry had been o"

“The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest
of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can
while you are waiting.”
Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville’s cloak, which was fastened
under his left ear, and on Ron’s smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to
flatten his hair.
“I shall return when we are r  you are here, your House will be something like
your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your
House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free time in your House

“The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and
Slytherin. Each House has its own noble history and each has produced
outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs
will earn your House points, while any rule-breaking will lose House points.
At the end of the House you’ll be in?
I’ve been asking around, and I hope I’m in Gryffindor, it sounds by far the
best; I hear Dumbledore himself was in it, but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn’t
be too bad. . . . Anyway, we’d better go and look for Neville’s toad. You two
had better change, you know, I expect we’ll be there soon.”
And she left, taking the toadless boy with her.“Whatever House I’m in, I hope she’s not in it,” said Ron. He threw his

What is the name of Harry Potter's owl?,Hedwig,"According to the passage, Harry Potter's owl is named Hedwig.","rry Potter’s, incidentally, who fought the Death Eaters
alongside him at the Ministry in June and —”
But the rest of this story was obscured by the large birdcage standing on
top of it. Inside it was a magnificent snowy owl. Her amber eyes surveyed the
room imperiously, her head swiveling occasionally to gaze at her snoring
master. Once or twice she clicked her beak impatiently, but Harry was too
deeply asleep to hear her.
A large trunk stood in the very middle of the room. Its lid was open; it
looked expec eeching, hooting, and flapping their wings.
“Harry!” said Hermione breathlessly, plunging her hands into the feathery
mass and pulling out a screech owl bearing a long, cylindrical package. “I
think I know what this means — open this one first!”
Harry ripped off the brown packaging. Out rolled a tightly furled copy of
March’s edition of 
The Quibbler. 
He unrolled it to see his own face grinning
sheepishly at him from the front cover. In large red letters across his picture
were the words:
 
HARRY POTTER SP He
brought it carefully inside. The owl dropped its letter onto Harry’s seat and
began zooming around their compartment, apparently very pleased with itself
for accomplishing its task. Hedwig clicked her beak with a sort of dignified
disapproval. Crookshanks sat up in his seat, following the owl with his great
yellow eyes. Ron, noticing this, snatched the owl safely out of harm’s way.
Harry picked up the letter. It was addressed to him. He ripped open the
letter, and shouted, “It’s from Sirius!”

A large picture of a familiar, hook-nosed, black-haired man stared up at
them all, beneath a headline that read:

“No!” said Ron and Hermione loudly.
Hermione was quickest; she snatched up the newspaper and began to read
the accompanying story out loud.

Witchcraft and Wizardry, was today appointed headmaster in the most
important of several staffing changes at the ancient school.   at Hogwarts,” said Harry. “I mean, there’s Dumbledore, for one
thing — you know who Dumbledore is, don’t you?”
Dobby bowed his head.
“Albus Dumbledore is the greatest headmaster Hogwarts has ever had.
Dobby knows it, sir. Dobby has heard Dumbledore’s powers rival those of
He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named at the height of his strength. But, sir” —
Dobby’s voice dropped to an urgent whisper — “there are powers

And before Harry could stop him, Dobby bounded off  unfolded it, and read it, with Ron,
Seamus, Dean, and Neville looking over his shoulder. It was an article topped
with a picture of Hagrid looking extremely shifty.
DUMBLEDORE’S GIANT MISTAKE
Albus Dumbledore, eccentric headmaster of Hogwarts School of
Witchcraft and Wizardry, has never been afraid to make
controversial staff appointments,

 Harry yelled. The spell hit the skrewt’s armor again and
ricocheted off; Harry staggered back a few paces and fell over.
“IMPEDIMENTA!”
The skrewt was inches from him when it froze — he had managed to hit it
on its fleshy, shell-less underside. Panting, Harry pushed himself away from it
and ran, hard, in the opposite direction — the Impediment Curse was not
permanent; the skrewt would be regaining the use of its legs at any moment.
He took a left path and hit a dead end, a right, and hit another; forcin as a
dangerous enemy, another to speak of them, as Snape was doing, with aloving caress in his voice?
“Your defenses,” said Snape, a little louder, “must therefore be as flexible
and inventive as the arts you seek to undo. These pictures” — he indicated a
few of them as he swept past — “give a fair representation of what happens to
those who suffer, for instance, the Cruciatus Curse” — he waved a hand

not seem to be making a sound. Harry did not have to look far for the solution

“Sorry, Harry,” said George hastily, when Harry caught his eye. “Couldn’t

Harry walked around the other pairs, trying to correct those who were
doing the spell wrong. Ginny was teamed with Michael Corner; s"
Who teaches Potions at Hogwarts?,Severus Snape,"According to the passage, Professor Snape teaches Potions at Hogwarts, and Professor McGonagall is mentioned as teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts and Charms."," Potions class
was about as safe as poking a sleeping dragon in the eye.
Potions lessons took place in one of the large dungeons. Thursday
afternoon’s lesson proceeded in the usual way. Twenty cauldrons stood
steaming between the wooden desks, on which stood brass scales and jars of
ingredients. Snape prowled through the fumes, making waspish remarks about
the Gryffindors’ work while the Slytherins sniggered appreciatively. Draco
Malfoy, who was Snape’s favorite student, kept flicking puffer-fish eyes at
Ro ly were they studying as though they had exams every day, but the
lessons themselves had become more demanding than ever before. Harry
barely understood half of what Professor McGonagall said to them these days;
even Hermione had had to ask her to repeat instructions once or twice.
Incredibly, and to Hermione’s increasing resentment, Harry’s best subject had
suddenly become Potions, thanks to the Half-Blood Prince.
Nonverbal spells were now expected, not only in Defense Against the Dark
Arts, but in Charms  their level,” she said briskly to
Snape’s back. “Though I would question whether it is advisable to teach them
a potion like the Strengthening Solution. I think the Ministry would prefer it if
that was removed from the syllabus.”
Snape straightened up slowly and turned to look at her.
“Now . . . how long have you been teaching at Hogwarts?” she asked, her
quill poised over her clipboard.
“Fourteen years,” Snape replied. His expression was unfathomable. His

interesting as Ron found him.
“Er — yes, I think so,” said Ron. “I think Mum’s got a second cousin
who’s an accountant, but we never talk about him.”
“So you must know loads of magic already.”The Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale boy
in Diagon Alley had talked about.

around the face, but descriptions of where each family member might be.
“Home,” “school,” and “work” were there, but there was also “traveling,”
“lost,” “hospital,” “prison,” and, in the position where the number twelve
would be on a normal clock, “mortal peril.”
Eight of the hands were currently pointing to the “home” position, but Mr.

“Your fath ning on. “Right.”
“Yeah, we’ll come too,” said George.
“You stay where you are!”

Harry and Ron edged out of the kitchen, and they, Hermione, and Ginny set
off along the narrow hallway and up the rickety staircase that zigzagged
through the house to the upper stories.
“What are Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes?” Harry asked as they climbed.
Ron and Ginny both laughed, although Hermione didn’t.

take in their meaning, and he read the last of them aloud.
“‘The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death’ . . .” A horrible thought
came to him, and wit . Again, your readers will have to buy my book for the

The twins turned. Harry pulled open his trunk and drew out his Triwizard

unobtrusive way, so as to avoid attracting Muggle attention. They did it in

casually against the barrier, chatting unconcernedly, and slid sideways

Harry glanced over to his right as they approached the Quidditch pitch, to
where the trees of the Forbidden Forest were swaying darkly. Nothing flew
out of them; the sky was empty but for a few distant owls fluttering around
the Owlery Tower. He had enough to worry about; the flying horse wasn’t
doing him any harm: He pushed it out of his mind.
They collected balls from t  distant chair. A closer look
showed him that it was Cormac McLaggen.

Harry’s drawn wand. “Must’ve fallen asleep. Look, I saw them taking

to let me go, when I sensed the beast moving about the school.”

“Aragog,” said Harry and Hagrid together.
Both Slughorn and Hagrid drank deeply. Harry, however, with the way

merely pretended to take a gulp and then set the mug back on the table before
him.
“I had him from an egg, yeh know,” said Hagrid morosely. “Tiny little

Wellington boots that lay scattered around the door. Harry could hear the

the Imperius Curse on each of them in turn, to demonstrate its power and to
see whether they could resist its effects.

stand on a pile of books to see over his desk. At the start of their first class he
took the roll call, and when he reached Harry’s name he gave an excited
squeak and toppled out of sight.
Professor McGonagall was again different. Harry had been quite right to
think she wasn’t a teacher to cross. Strict and clever, she gave them a talking-
to the moment they sat down in her first class.
“Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you
will learn at Hog ng Secrecy — it
was too much to hope that no Muggles would spot an Aqua-Lung zooming
across the countryside to Hogwarts.
“Of course, the ideal solution would be for you to Transfigure yourself into
a submarine or something,” Hermione said. “If only we’d done human
Transfiguration already! But I don’t think we start that until sixth year, and it
can go badly wrong if you don’t know what you’re doing. . . .”
“Yeah, I don’t fancy walking around with a periscope sticking out of my
head,” said Harry. “I s’pose I d the brains, or the power!

was innocent. He persuaded Dippet to keep Hagrid and train him as
gamekeeper. Yes, I think Dumbledore might have guessed. . . . Dumbledore
never seemed to like me as much as the other teachers did. . . .”
“I bet Dumbledore saw right through you,” said Harry, his teeth gritted.

expelled,” said Riddle carelessly. “I knew it wouldn’t be safe"

“Here it is,” said Hermione excitedly as she found the page headed 
The
Polyjuice Potion.
 It was decorated with drawings of people halfway through
transforming into other people. Harry sincerely hoped the artist had imagined
the looks of intense pain on their faces.
“This is the most complicated potion I’ve ever seen,” said Hermione as
they scanned the recipe. “Lacewing flies, leeches, fluxweed, and knotgrass,”
she murmured, running her finger g up at Hagrid. “The Polyjuice
Potion is designed for human use only.”
“None of the Order would have told Voldemort we were moving tonight,”
said Harry. The idea was dreadful to him, he could not believe it of any of
them. “Voldemort only caught up with me toward the end, he didn’t knowwhich one I was in the beginning. If he’d been in on the plan he’d have
known from the start I was the one with Hagrid.”
“Voldemort caught up with you?” said Lupin sharply. “What happened?
How did you escape?”

he seems in no immediate danger.”
Harry did as he was told; Dumbledore covered Moody in the cloak, tucked
it around him, and clambered out of the trunk again. Then he picked up the

glutinous liquid splattered onto the office floor.

seemingly endlessly, and came to rest across Voldemort’s shoulders: its neck
the thickness of a man’s thigh; its eyes, with their vertical slits for pupils,
unblinking. Voldemort stroked the creature absently with long thin fingers,
still looking at Lucius Malfoy.
“Why do the Malfoys look so unhappy with their lot? Is my return, my riseto power, not the very thing they professed to desire for so many years?”
“Of course, my Lord,” said Lucius Malf serpent, which relinquished its hold
upon Voldemort at once and turned, hissing furiously, to face Dumbledore.
Voldemort vanished. The snake reared from the floor, ready to strike —
There was a burst of flame in midair above Dumbledore just as Voldemort
reappeared, standing on the plinth in the middle of the pool where so recently
the five statues had stood.
“Look out!” 
Harry yelled.
But even as he shouted, one more jet of green light had flown at
Dumbledore from Voldemort’s wand and the snake had struck —  Voldemort, who stood with his head bowed, and
his white hands folded over the Elder Wand in front of him. He might have
been praying, or else counting silently in his mind, and Harry, standing still
on the edge of the scene, thought absurdly of a child counting in a game of
hide-and-seek. Behind his head, still swirling and coiling, the great snake
Nagini floated in her glittering, charmed cage, like a monstrous halo.

the accompanying story out loud.

“It — well — it shows me my family —”
“And it showed your friend Ron himself as Head Boy.”
“How did you know — ?”
“I don’t need a cloak to become invisible,” said Dumbledore gently. “Now,
can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?”
Harry shook his head.
“Let me explain. The happiest man on earth would be able to use the
Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it and see
himself exactly as he is. Does that help?”
Harry thought. Then he said slo e other than Albus
Dumbledore. Harry must have walked straight past him, so desperate to get to
the mirror he hadn’t noticed him.“I — I didn’t see you, sir.”
“Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you,” said Dumbledore,
and Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling.
“So,” said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with Harry,
“you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of
Erised.”
“I didn’t know it was called that, sir.”
“But I expect you’ve real n driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible.

They listened. Some distance to their right, the something big was snapping
branches as it carved a path through the trees.

Harry snapped the earmuffs over his ears. They shut out sound completely.
Professor Sprout put the pink, fluffy pair over her own ears, rolled up thesleeves of her robes, grasped one of the tufty plants firmly, and pulled hard.
Harry let out a gasp of surprise that no one could hear.
Instead of roots, a small, muddy, and extremely ugly baby popped out of
the earth. The leaves were growing right out of his head. He had pale green,
mottled skin, and was clearly bawling at the t sted rather
than revolted, but putting down his rock cake all the same.
“Jus’ giant grubs,” said Hagrid.
“And they grow into . . . ?” said Ron, looking apprehensive.“They won’ grow inter nuthin’,” said Hagrid. “I got ’em ter feed ter

And without warning, he burst into tears.

shoulders. “What is it?”

open.

But that wasn’t what was bothering Harry.

Dudley had made sure of that.
Nevertheless, Harry was determined to find out more about Riddle, so next
day at break, he headed for the trophy room to examine Riddle’s special
award, accompanied by an interested Hermione and a thoroughly
unconvinced Ron, who told them he’d seen enough of the trophy room to last
him a lifetime.

Harry patiently. “What we really need is a boggart or something; that’s how I
