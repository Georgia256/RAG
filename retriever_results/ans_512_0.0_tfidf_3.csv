sniggered, but Slughorn showed no dismay; on the contrary, he beamed and
looked from Hermione to Harry, who was sitting next to her.
“Oho! 
‘One of my best friends is Muggle-born, and she’s the best in our
year!’
 I’m assuming this is the very friend of whom you spoke, Harry?”
“Yes, sir,” said Harry.
“Well, well, take twenty well-earned points for Gryffindor, Miss Granger,”
said Slughorn genially.
Malfoy looked rather as he had done the time Hermione had punched him
in the face. Hermione turned to Harry wi e three Weasley boys, Harry, Hermione, and Ginny.
“All these yours, Arthur?”
“Oh no, only the redheads,” said Mr. Weasley, pointing out his children.
“This is Hermione, friend of Ron’s — and Harry, another friend —”
“Merlin’s beard,” said Amos Diggory, his eyes widening. “Harry? Harry
Potter
?”
“Er — yeah,” said Harry.
Harry was used to people looking curiously at him when they met him,
used to the way their eyes moved at once to the lightning scar on his forehead,
but it always made him feel uncomfortable."

What is the name of Harry Potter's owl?,Hedwig,"The name of Harry Potter's owl is not explicitly mentioned in this passage. However, the owl is described as a ""minute owl"" and is referred to as ""he"" and ""him"" in the passage, suggesting that it is a male owl.","k at Sirius’s letter.
“Hang on, there’s a P.S. . . .”
I thought your friend Ron might like to keep this owl, as it’s my fault
he no longer has a rat.
Ron’s eyes widened. The minute owl was still hooting excitedly.
“Keep him?” he said uncertainly. He looked closely at the owl for a
moment; then, to Harry’s and Hermione’s great surprise, he held him out for
Crookshanks to sniff.
“What d’you reckon?” Ron asked the cat. “Definitely an owl?”Crookshanks purred.
“That’s good enough for me,” said Ron happily. “He’s  as though a large balloon was
swelling inside him. He went straight to the window and jerked it open. The
owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of Hagrid, who didn’t
wake up. The owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to attack Hagrid’scoat.
“Don’t do that.”
Harry tried to wave the owl out of the way, but it snapped its beak fiercely
at him and carried on savaging the coat.
“Hagrid!” said Harry loudly. “There’s an owl —”

“What?”

Who is the headmaster of Hogwarts?,Albus Dumbledore,"According to the context, Severus Snape has just been appointed as the new Headmaster of Hogwarts."," the Hogwarts Express to come
tomorrow if necessary —”
“What about Dumbledore’s funeral?” said Harry, speaking at last.
“Well . . .” said Professor McGonagall, losing a little of her briskness as her
voice shook. “I — I know that it was Dumbledore’s wish to be laid to rest
here, at Hogwarts —”
“Then that’s what’ll happen, isn’t it?” said Harry fiercely.
“If the Ministry thinks it appropriate,” said Professor McGonagall. “No

A large picture of a familiar, hook-nosed, black-haired man stared up at
them all, beneath a headline that read:
SEVERUS SNAPE CONFIRMED AS HOGWARTS HEADMASTER
“No!” said Ron and Hermione loudly.
Hermione was quickest; she snatched up the newspaper and began to read
the accompanying story out loud.
“‘Severus Snape, long-standing Potions master at Hogwarts School of
Witchcraft and Wizardry, was today appointed headmaster in the most
important of several staffing changes at the ancient school.  he had just been appointed Head Boy. Harry didn’t realize what he was so
pleased about until the Potions lesson about two weeks after Dumbledore and
Hagrid had left, when, sitting right behind Malfoy, Harry overheard him
gloating to Crabbe and Goyle.
“I always thought Father might be the one who got rid of Dumbledore,” he
said, not troubling to keep his voice down. “I told you he thinks
Dumbledore’s the worst headmaster the school’s ever had. Maybe we’ll get a
decent headmaster now. Someone who won’t

reminded Harry of a picture he’d seen in 
Holidays with Hags.
 She was large
and square and her heavy jaw jutted aggressively. Hermione gave her a weak
smile that she did not return.
“Face your partners!” called Lockhart, back on the platform. “And bow!”
Harry and Malfoy barely inclined their heads, not taking their eyes off each
other.
“Wands at the ready!” shouted Lockhart. “When I count to three, cast your
charms to Disarm your opponents — 
only
 to disarm them — we don’t want

Anthony Goldstein, his own wand would fly out of his hand, yet Anthony did
not seem to be making a sound. Harry did not have to look far for the solution
of the mystery, however; Fred and George were several feet from Smith and
taking it in turns to point their wands at his back.
“Sorry, Harry,” said George hastily, when Harry caught his eye. “Couldn’t
resist . . .”
Harry walked around the other pairs, trying to correct those who were
doing the spell wrong. Ginny was teamed with Michael Corner; s idents — one . . . two . . . three —”
Harry swung his wand high, but Malfoy had already started on “two”: His
spell hit Harry so hard he felt as though he’d been hit over the head with a
saucepan. He stumbled, but everything still seemed to be working, and
wasting no more time, Harry pointed his wand straight at Malfoy and shouted,
“Rictusempra!”A jet of silver light hit Malfoy in the stomach and he doubled up, wheezing.
“I said Disarm only!”
 Lockhart shouted in alarm over the heads of the
battling crowd, "
Who teaches Potions at Hogwarts?,Severus Snape,"According to the passage, Professor Snape teaches Potions at Hogwarts.","We are also looking for new
Quidditch commentators, who should do likewise.
“We are pleased to welcome a new member of staff this year. Professor
Slughorn” — Slughorn stood up, his bald head gleaming in the candlelight,
his big waistcoated belly casting the table below into shadow — “is a former
colleague of mine who has agreed to resume his old post of Potions master.”
“Potions?”
“Potions?”
The word echoed all over the Hall as people wondered whether they had
heard right.
“Potions?” said Ron and Hermione t “Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder he’s looking so
nervous, that’s Professor Snape. He teaches Potions, but he doesn’t want to —
everyone knows he’s after Quirrell’s job. Knows an awful lot about the Dark
Arts, Snape.”
Harry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn’t look at him again.
At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to his
feet again. The hall fell silent.
“Ahem — just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I
have a few start-of-term notice  how come these girls
are able to bring love potions into school?”
“Fred and George send them disguised as perfumes and cough potions,”
said Hermione. “It’s part of their Owl Order Service.”
“You know a lot about it.”
Hermione gave him the kind of nasty look she had just given his copy of
Advanced Potion-Making.
“It was all on the back of the bottles they showed Ginny and me in the
summer,” she said coldly. “I don’t go around putting potions in people’s
drinks . . . or pretending to, either, which is just a"

The Keeper of the Keys at were they after, do you think?”
“Information on the Order, if it was Snape.”
“But you’d think he’d already have all he needed, I mean, he was 
in 
the
Order, wasn’t he?”
“Well then,” said Harry, keen to discuss his theory, “what about
information on Dumbledore? The second page of this letter, for instance. You
know this Bathilda my mum mentions, you know who she is?”
“Who?”
“Bathilda Bagshot, the author of —”
“
A History of Magic,
” said Hermione, looking interested. “So your parents
knew her? She was an ould never talk to Rita Skeeter!” whispered Doge.
“Bathilda Bagshot?” Harry said. “The author of 
A History of Magic
?”
The name was printed on the front of one of Harry’s textbooks, though
admittedly not one of the ones he had read most attentively.
“Yes,” said Doge, clutching at Harry’s question like a drowning man at a
life belt. “A most gifted magical historian and an old friend of Albus’s.”
“Quite gaga these days, I’ve heard,” said Auntie Muriel cheerfully.

platform nine and three quarters, where the Hogwarts Express stood belching
sooty steam over a platform packed with departing students and their families.Harry inhaled the familiar smell and felt his spirits soar. . . . He was really
going back. . . .
“I hope the others make it in time,” said Mrs. Weasley anxiously, staring
behind her at the wrought-iron arch spanning the platform, through which
new arrivals would come.
“Nice dog, Harry!” called a tall boy with dreadlocks.
“Thanks, Lee,” said Harr ty 125
that had just arrived at platform nine. With a meaningful look at Harry, he
leaned casually against the barrier. Harry imitated him.
In a moment, they had fallen sideways through the solid metal onto
platform nine and three-quarters and looked up to see the Hogwarts Express, a
scarlet steam engine, puffing smoke over a platform packed with witches and
wizards seeing their children onto the train.
Percy and Ginny suddenly appeared behind Harry. They were panting and
had apparently taken the barrier at dumped Harry’s
trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him. Harry thought this
was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, facing the platforms
with a nasty grin on his face.
“Well, there you are, boy. Platform nine — platform ten. Your platform
should be somewhere in the middle, but they don’t seem to have built it yet,
do they?”
He was quite right, of course. There was a big plastic number nine over one
platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it, and in the
middle,"
What is the name of Harry's godfather?,Sirius Black,The name of Harry's godfather is Sirius Black.," Harry bid him
and Hermione good-bye, then wheeled the trolley bearing his trunk and
Hedwig’s cage toward Uncle Vernon, who greeted him in his usual fashion.
“What’s that?” he snarled, staring at the envelope Harry was still clutching
in his hand. “If it’s another form for me to sign, you’ve got another —”
“It’s not,” said Harry cheerfully. “It’s a letter from my godfather.”

Who is the gamekeeper at Hogwarts?,Rubeus Hagrid,The gamekeeper at Hogwarts is Rubeus Hagrid.,"the Dark Arts, a decision that caused many raised eyebrows
at the Ministry of Magic, given Moody’s well-known habit of
attacking anybody who makes a sudden movement in his presence.
Mad-Eye Moody, however, looks responsible and kindly when set
beside the part-human Dumbledore employs to teach Care ofMagical Creatures.
Rubeus Hagrid, who admits to being expelled from Hogwarts in
his third year, has enjoyed the position of gamekeeper at the school
ever since, a job secured for him by Dumbledore. Last year,
ho hose friends of Harry Potter’s who are
suffering for their allegiance?” Lee was saying.
“Well, as regular listeners will know, several of the more outspoken
supporters of Harry Potter have now been imprisoned, including Xenophilius
Lovegood, erstwhile editor of

“At least he’s still alive!” muttered Ron.
“We have also heard within the last few hours that Rubeus Hagrid” — all
three of them gasped, and so nearly missed the rest of the sentence — “well-
known gamekeeper at Hogwarts  is hood up.”
Harry sank down next to the bowl of peas.
“What did you talk to him about, Hagrid? Did you mention Hogwarts at
all?”
“Mighta come up,” said Hagrid, frowning as he tried to remember.
“Yeah . . . he asked what I did, an’ I told him I was gamekeeper here. . . . He
asked a bit about the sorta creatures I look after . . . so I told him . . . an’ I said
what I’d always really wanted was a dragon . . . an’ then . . . I can’ remember

What position does Harry play on his Quidditch team?,Seeker,Harry plays as a Seeker on his Quidditch team.,"or Quidditch team to re-form? How you took the case to
Dumbledore, who insisted that the team be allowed to play? Well, now, I
couldn’t have that. I contacted the Minister at once, and he quite agreed with
me that the High Inquisitor has to have the power to strip pupils of privileges,
or she — that is to say, I — would have less authority than common teachers!
And you see now, don’t you, Minerva, how right I was in attempting to stop
the Gryffindor team re-forming?

and he’s tired. . . . We all need to go to bed. . . .”
“Yeah, I want to play Quidditch,” said Harry suddenly. “Hang on, I’ll get
my Firebolt.”
Hermione left the room, muttering something that sounded very much like
“Boys.”
Neither Mr. Weasley nor Percy was at home much over the following week.
Both left the house each morning before the rest of the family got up, and
returned well after dinner e he damage, but Harry swore to himself not to
meddle in things that weren’t his business from now on. He’d had it with
sneaking around and spying. He felt so ashamed of himself that he went to
Wood and offered to resign from the Quidditch team.
“Resign?”
 Wood thundered. “What good’ll that do? How are we going toget any points back if we can’t win at Quidditch?”
But even Quidditch had lost its fun. The rest of the team wouldn’t speak to
Harry during practice, and if they had to speak about him, they called h"

though they had been thrust into icy water.
“Nick, you’ve got to help me. Who’s the ghost of Ravenclaw Tower?”
Nearly Headless Nick looked surprised and a little offended.
“The Gray Lady, of course; but if it is ghostly services you require — ?”

What magical creature pulls the carriages to Hogwarts?,Thestrals,"According to the passage, the magical creatures that pull the carriages to Hogwarts are not explicitly mentioned. However, it is mentioned that ""a hundred horseless carriages"" are waiting for Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Neville outside the station, suggesting that some kind of magical creatures or transportation mechanism is used to pull the carriages.",", I wouldn’t fancy crossing the lake in this weather,” said Hermione
fervently, shivering as they inched slowly along the dark platform with the
rest of the crowd. A hundred horseless carriages stood waiting for them
outside the station. Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Neville climbed gratefully into
one of them, the door shut with a snap, and a few moments later, with a great
lurch, the long procession of carriages was rumbling and splashing its way up
the track toward Hogwarts Castle.T

THE TRI flustered, and
following Krum through the crowd and out of sight.
“You’d better hurry up!” Ron called loudly after her. “The carriages’ll be
here in a minute!”
He let Harry keep a watch for the carriages, however, and spent the next
few minutes craning his neck over the crowd to try and see what Krum and
Hermione might be up to. They returned quite soon. Ron stared at Hermione,
but her face was quite impassive.
“I liked Diggory,” said Krum abruptly to Harry. “He vos alvays polite to

creature on the bed had large, bat-like ears and bulging green eyes the

As they stared at each other, Harry heard Dudley’s voice from the hall.
“May I take your coats, Mr. and Mrs. Mason?”
The creature slipped off the bed and bowed so low that the end of its long,
thin nose touched the carpet. Harry noticed that it was wearing what looked
like an old pillowcase, with rips fo"
What is the name of the house elf who serves the Malfoy family?,Dobby,"The house-elf who serves the Malfoy family is not explicitly mentioned in this passage.

“The wizard family Dobby serves, sir. . . . Dobby is a house-elf — bound to
serve one house and one family forever. . . .”
“Do they know you’re here?” asked Harry curiously.
Dobby shuddered.
“Oh, no, sir, no . . . Dobby will have to punish himself most grievou  Malfoy made Dudley Dursley look like a kind,
thoughtful, and sensitive boy.
“I don’t know whether the Malfoys own a house-elf. . . .” said Harry.
“Well, whoever owns him will be an old Wizarding family, and they’ll be
rich,” said Fred.
“Yeah, Mum’s always wishing we had a house-elf to do the ironing,” said
George. “But all we’ve got is a lousy old ghoul in the attic and gnomes all
over the garden. House-elves come with big old manors and castles and
places like that; you wouldn’t catch one in our house. .  . .”Harry was silent. Judging by the fact that Draco Malfoy usually had the
best of everything, his family was rolling in wizard gold; he could just see
Malfoy strutting around a large manor house. Sending the family servant to
stop Harry from going back to Hogwarts also sounded exactly like the sort of
thing Malfoy would do. Had Harry been stupid to take Dobby seriously?
“I’m glad we came to get you, anyway,” said Ron. “I was getting really
worried when you didn’t answer any of my letters. I thought it was"
Who is the Half-Blood Prince?,Severus Snape,"The Half-Blood Prince is a mysterious figure whose identity is unknown to Harry, Ron, and Hermione.

had been looking forward to asking Lupin.
“Have you ever heard of someone called the Half-Blood Prince?”
“The Half-Blood what?”
“Prince,” said Harry, watching him closely for signs of recognition.
“There are no Wizarding princes,” said Lupin, now smiling. “Is this a title
you’re thinking of adopting? I should have thought being ‘the Chosen One’
would be enough.”
“It’s nothing to do with me!” said Harry indignantly. “The Half-Blood
Prince is someon  If, say, her father wasa wizard whose surname was Prince, and her mother was a Muggle, then that
would make her a ‘half-blood Prince’!”
“Yeah, very ingenious, Hermione . . .”
“But it would! Maybe she was proud of being half a Prince!”
“Listen, Hermione, I can tell it’s not a girl. I can just tell.”
“The truth is that you don’t think a girl would have been clever enough,”
said Hermione angrily.
“How can I have hung round with you for five years and not think girls are
clever?” said Harry, stung by this. “It . “Can I borrow your quill for the
conclusion?”
Harry, who had found nothing useful in the Half-Blood Prince’s notes so
far, looked around; the three of them were now the only ones left in the
common room, Seamus having just gone up to bed cursing Snape and his
essay. The only sounds were the crackling of the fire and Ron scratching out
one last paragraph on dementors using Hermione’s quill. Harry had just
closed the Half-Blood Prince’s book, yawning, when —

Harry. “Are you sure? Well then, the Dark Lord must be informed at once!”
She dragged back her left sleeve: Harry saw the Dark Mark burned into the
flesh of her arm, and knew that she was about to touch it, to summon her
beloved master —
“I was about to call him!” said Lucius, and his hand actually closed upon
Bellatrix’s wrist, preventing her from touching the Mark. “
I 
shall summon
him, Bella, Potter has been brought to my house, and it is therefore upon my

“Yes,” said Dumbledore, smiling, “I would be prepared to bet — perhaps
not my other hand — but a couple of fingers, that they became Horcruxes
three and four. The remaining two, assuming again that he created a total of
six, are more of a problem, but I will hazard a guess that, having secured
objects from Hufflepuff and Slytherin, he set out to track down objects owned
by Gryffindor or Ravenclaw. Four objects from the four founders would, I am
sure, have exerted a powerful pull over Vold usband in her

persuade Slughorn to hand over the true memory, b was still fighting his way across the
lake with the first years; Professor McGonagall was presumably supervisingthe drying of the entrance hall floor, but there was another empty chair too,
and Harry couldn’t think who else was missing.
“Where’s the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher?” said Hermione,
who was also looking up at the teachers.
They had never yet had a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher who had
lasted more than three terms. Harry’s favorite by far had been Professor
Lupin, who had res ogether, turning to stare at Harry. “But
you said —”
“Professor Snape, meanwhile,” said Dumbledore, raising his voice so that it
carried over all the muttering, “will be taking over the position of Defense
Against the Dark Arts teacher.”
“No!” said Harry, so loudly that many heads turned in his direction. He didnot care; he was staring up at the staff table, incensed. How could Snape be
given the Defense Against the Dark Arts job after all this time? Hadn’t it been
widely known for years that Dumbledore did"

“
You

“Certainly. I have a special gift with trolls — you must have seen what I
did to the one in the chamber back there? Unfortunately, while everyone else
was running around looking for it, Snape, who already suspected me, went
straight to the third floor to head me off — and not only did my troll fail to
beat you to death, that three-headed dog didn’t even manage to bite Snape’s
leg off properly.
“Now, wait quietly, P ht into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a dog thatfilled the whole space between ceiling and floor. It had three heads. Three
pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching and quivering in their
direction; three drooling mouths, saliva hanging in slippery ropes from
yellowish fangs.
It was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and Harry knew that
the only reason they weren’t already dead was that their sudden appearance
had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over that, there wa are you okay?”
“Where’s the dog?”
“Not a dog,” Ron moaned. His teeth were gritted with pain. “Harry, it’s a
trap —”
“What —”
“He’s the dog . . . he’s an Animagus. . . .”
Ron was staring over Harry’s shoulder. Harry wheeled around. With a snap,
the man in the shadows closed the door behind them.
A mass of filthy, matted hair hung to his elbows. If eyes hadn’t been
shining out of the deep, dark sockets, he might have been a corpse. The waxy
skin was stretched so tightly over the bones of his face, it looked l"
What creature is Aragog?,Acromantula,Aragog is a giant spider.,"pes shifted all around him.
“The thing that lives in the castle,” said Aragog, “is an ancient creature we
spiders fear above all others. Well do I remember how I pleaded with Hagrid
to let me go, when I sensed the beast moving about the school.”
“What is it?” said Harry urgently.
More loud clicking, more rustling; the spiders seemed to be closing in.
“We do not speak of it!” said Aragog fiercely. “We do not name it! I never
even told Hagrid the name of that dread creature, though he asked me, many
times.”
H gh’ nice of him, that is, an’ not turnin’ yeh in either. I’ve never really
had a lot ter do with Horace Slughorn before. . . . Comin’ ter see old Aragog
off, though, eh? Well . . . he’d’ve liked that, Aragog would. . . .”
Harry thought privately that what Aragog would have liked most about
Slughorn was the ample amount of edible flesh he provided, but he merely
moved to the rear window of Hagrid’s hut, where he saw the rather horrible
sight of the enormous dead spider lying on its back outside, its legs cur arry didn’t want to press the subject, not with the spiders pressing closer
on all sides. Aragog seemed to be tired of talking. He was backing slowly into
his domed web, but his fellow spiders continued to inch slowly toward Harry
and Ron.
“We’ll just go, then,” Harry called desperately to Aragog, hearing leaves
rustling behind him.
“Go?” said Aragog slowly. “I think not. . . .”
“But — but —”

beside the open window of the Gryffindor common room, looking out over
the twilit grounds.
“She’s not that bad,” said Harry. “Ugly, though,” he added hastily, as Ginny
raised her eyebrows, and she let out a reluctant giggle.
“Well, I suppose if Mum can stand it, I can.”
“Anyone else we know died?” Ron asked Hermione, who was perusing the
Evening Prophet.
Hermione winced at the forced toughness in his v  her eldest son; she began to sob, tears falling onto Bill’s mutilated
face.
“Of course, it doesn’t matter how he looks. . . . It’s not r-really
important . . . but he was a very handsome little b-boy . . . always very
handsome . . . and he was g-going to be married!”
“And what do you mean by zat?” said Fleur suddenly and loudly. “What do
you mean, ‘’e was

Mrs. Weasley raised her tear-stained face, looking startled. “Well — only
that —”
“You theenk Bill will not wish to marry me any  have you? Probably
wise. Be sure and marry a pureblood next time.”
Hermione had let out a little squeak of horror. Yaxley looked at her. She
coughed feebly and turned away.

my
 wife were accused of being a Mudblood,” said Yaxley, “— not

fast as they could. Hermione looked after them curiously, until the man with
the bloodied bandage came staggering right across her path.
“My children!” he bellowed, pointing at her. His voice was cracked, high-
pitched; he sounded distraught. “Where are my children? What has he done
with them? You know, 
you know

“I — I really —” stammered Hermione.
The man lunged at her, reaching for her throat: Then, with a bang and a
burst of red light he was thrown back owever, it was in his usual curt voice.
“We must follow the rules, and the rules state clearly that those people
whose names come out of the Goblet of Fire are bound to compete in the
tournament.”
“Well, Barty knows the rule book back to front,” said Bagman, beaming
and turning back to Karkaroff and Madame Maxime, as though the matter
was now closed.
“I insist upon resubmitting the names of the rest of my students,” saidKarkaroff. He had dropped his unctuous tone and his smile now. His face
wore a very ugly  matter, however. I have all their names here, MissParkinson ran into the Room of Requirement for me to see if they had left
anything behind. . . . We needed evidence and the room provided . . .”
And to Harry’s horror, she withdrew from her pocket the list of names that
had been pinned upon the Room of Requirement’s wall and handed it to
Fudge.
“The moment I saw Potter’s name on the list, I knew what we were dealing
with,” she said softly.
“Excellent,” said Fudge, a smile spreading across his face. “Excelle"

“Yeah, but that’s another thing, how did they get premises?” said Ron,
hitting his teacup so hard with his wand that its legs collapsed again and it lay
twitching before him. “It’s a bit dodgy, isn’t it? They’ll need loads of
Galleons to afford the rent on a place in Diagon Alley, she’ll want to know
what they’ve been up to, to get their hands on that sort of gold . . .”

“I don’t need you,” said Riddle. “I’m used to doing things for myself, I go

Harry thought that Dumbledore would insist upon accompanying Riddle,
but once again he was surprised. Dumbledore h , or Hermione
Granger this time.
Three boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle one at once: It was
the pale boy from Madam Malkin’s robe shop. He was looking at Harry with
a lot more interest than he’d shown back in Diagon Alley.
“Is it true?” he said. “They’re saying all down the train that Harry Potter’s
in this compartment. So it’s you, is it?”
“Yes,” said Harry. He was looking at the other boys. Both of them were
thickset and looked extremely mean. Standing on either side of the pale boy,

At the end of the had tried to put me in Slytherin, I’d’ve got the

Hermione nodded fervently, but Harry didn’t say anything. His stomach
had just dropped unpleasantly.
Harry had never told Ron and Hermione that the Sorting Hat had seriously
considered putting 
him
 in Slytherin. He could remember, as though it were
yesterday, the small voice that had spoken in his ear when he’d placed the hat
on his head a year before:

of the staircase soon; his leg was really hurting him.
“Merlin’s beard,” Moody whispered, staring at the map, his magical eye
going haywire. “This . . . this is some map, Potter!”

You told me to keep you posted on what’s happening at Hogwarts,

Goblet of Fire, because I didn’t. The other Hogwarts champion is

the inhabitants of the castle. During the following week, there seemed to be
only one topic of conversation, no matter where Harry went: the Triwizard
Tournament. Rumors were flying from student to student like highly
contagious germs: who was going to try for Hogwarts champion, what the
tournament would involve, how the students from Beauxbatons and
Durmstrang differed from themselves.

the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a
statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didn’t
so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two
owls swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved

jump. Then there were doors that wouldn’t open unless you asked politely, or
tickled them in exactly the right place, and doors that weren’t really doors at
all, but solid walls just pretending. It was also very hard to remember where
anything was, because it all seemed to move around a lot. The people in the
portraits kept going to visit each other, and Harry was sure the coats of armor
could walk.The ghosts didn’t help, either. It was always  mione were on their feet, all three of them having used a
different hex. Nor were they the only ones to have done so.
“Thought we’d see what those three were up to,” said Fred matter-of-factly,
stepping onto Goyle and into the compartment. He had his wand out, and so
did George, who was careful to tread on Malfoy as he followed Fred inside.
“Interesting effect,” said George, looking down at Crabbe. “Who used the
Furnunculus Curse?”
“Me,” said Harry.
“Odd,” said George lightly. “I used Jelly-Legs. Looks as t"

Ron gave an involuntary shudder.
“Years back, there were a lot of witches and wizards being controlled by
the Imperius Curse,” said Moody, and Harry knew he was talking about the
days in which Voldemort had been all-powerful. “Some job for the Ministry,
trying to sort out who was being forced to act, and who was acting of their
own free will.
“The Imperius Curse can be fought, and I’ll be teaching you how, but it
takes real strength of character, and not everyone’s got it. Better a  a raid on his
Clapham home . . .’”
“Stan Shunpike, a Death Eater?” said Harry, remembering the spotty youth
he had first met three years before. “No way!”
“He might have been put under the Imperius Curse,” said Ron reasonably.
“You never can tell.”
“It doesn’t look like it,” said Hermione, who was still reading. “It says here
he was arrested after he was overheard talking about the Death Eaters’ secret
plans in a pub.” She looked up with a troubled expression on her face. “If he

Mungo’s, his brain had gone all funny and he couldn’t talk. But remember
what the Healer told us? He was recovering. And they couldn’t risk him

touched that weapon probably made the Imperius Curse lift. Once he’d got his
voice back, he’d explain what he’d been doing, wouldn’t he? They would
have known he’d been sent to steal the weapon. Of course, it would have been

who was trying to read it upside down.
Harry looked at his watch and hurriedly put the old copy of 
Advanced
Potion-Making
 back into his bag.
“It’s five to eight, I’d better go, I’ll be late for Dumbledore.”
“Ooooh!” gasped Hermione, looking up at once. “Good luck! We’ll wait
up, we want to hear what he teaches you!”
“Hope it goes okay,” said Ron, and the pair of them watched Harry leave
through the portrait hole.
Harry proceeded through rts, except now it’s just the Dark Arts. We’re supposed to practice the

“What?”
Harry, Ron, and Hermione’s united voices echoed up and down the
passage.
“Yeah,” said Neville. “That’s how I got this one,” he pointed at a
particularly deep gash in his cheek, “I refused to do it. Some people are into
it, though; Crabbe and Goyle love it. First time they’ve ever been top in

“Alecto, Amycus’s sister, teaches Muggle Studies, which is compul very important!” said Hermione, shocked.
“Not the way Lockhart teaches it,” said Ron. “I haven’t learned anything
from him except not to set pixies loose.”
Neville Longbottom had been sent letters from all the witches and wizards
in his family, all giving him different advice on what to choose. Confused and
worried, he sat reading the subject lists with his tongue poking out, asking
people whether they thought Arithmancy sounded more difficult than Study
of Ancient Runes. Dean Thomas, who, like Harry, had g"

“Yeah, that is weird,” said Harry, frowning. “I heard him telling Crabbe it
wasn’t Crabbe’s business what he was doing . . . so what’s he telling all
these . . . all these . . .”
Harry’s voice tailed away; he was staring at the fire.
“God, I’ve been stupid,” he said quietly. “It’s obvious, isn’t it? There was a
great vat of it down in the dungeon. . . . He could’ve nicked some any time
during that lesson. . . .”
“Nicked what?” said Ron.
“Polyjuice Potion. He stole some of the Polyjuice Potion Slu w did you escape from Azkaban?”
Crouch took a deep, shuddering breath, then began to speak in a flat,
expressionless voice.
“My mother saved me. She knew she was dying. She persuaded my father
to rescue me as a last favor to her. He loved her as he had never loved me. He
agreed. They came to visit me. They gave me a draught of Polyjuice Potion
containing one of my mother’s hairs. She took a draught of Polyjuice Potion
containing one of my hairs. We took on each other’s appearance.”
Winky was shaking her hea that
Malfoy was staying, which struck them as very suspicious. The holidays
would be the perfect time to use the Polyjuice Potion and try to worm a
confession out of him.
Unfortunately, the potion was only half finished. They still needed the
bicorn horn and the boomslang skin, and the only place they were going to get
them was from Snape’s private stores. Harry privately felt he’d rather face
Slytherin’s legendary monster than let Snape catch him robbing his office.

“No,” he said. “

“W-what?”
He closed his eyes. He could still smell Bathilda’s house on him: It made
the whole thing horribly vivid.
“Bathilda must’ve been dead a while. The snake was . . . was inside her.
You-Know-Who put it there in Godric’s Hollow, to wait. You were right. He

“The snake was

He opened hi ot know how I got there.”
Harry hardly dared believe her, yet his heart was lightening almost in spite
of himself.
“That dream I had about your dad and the snake, though —”
“Harry, you’ve had these dreams before,” Hermione said. “You had flashes
of what Voldemort was up to last year.”
“This was different,” said Harry, shaking his head. “I was inside that snake.
It was like I

to London — ?”
“One day,” said Hermione, sounding thoroughly exasperat serpent, which relinquished its hold
upon Voldemort at once and turned, hissing furiously, to face Dumbledore.
Voldemort vanished. The snake reared from the floor, ready to strike —
There was a burst of flame in midair above Dumbledore just as Voldemort
reappeared, standing on the plinth in the middle of the pool where so recently
the five statues had stood.
“Look out!” 
Harry yelled.
But even as he shouted, one more jet of green light had flown at
Dumbledore from Voldemort’s wand and the snake had struck —"

He accompanied them to the entrance hall, where Filch, the caretaker, was
standing inside the front doors, checking off names against a long list, peering
suspiciously into every face, and making sure that no one was sneaking out
who shouldn’t be going.
“Staying here, Potter?” shouted Malfoy, who was standing in line with
Crabbe and Goyle. “Scared of passing the dementors?”
Harry ignored him and made his solitary way up the marble staircase,
through the   excursion carefully, because he had been caught out of
bed and out-of-bounds by Filch the caretaker in the middle of the night once
before, and had no desire to repeat the experience. The Invisibility Cloak
would, of course, be essential, and as an added precaution, Harry thought he
would take the Marauder’s Map, which, next to the Cloak, was the most
useful aid to rule-breaking Harry owned. The map showed the whole of
Hogwarts, including its many shortcuts and secret passageways and, most
important of all Ron, and Hermione exchanged smirks.)
“Mr. Filch, the caretaker, has asked me, for what he tells me is the four

“It — well — it shows me my family —”
“And it showed your friend Ron himself as Head Boy.”
“How did you know — ?”
“I don’t need a cloak to become invisible,” said Dumbledore gently. “Now,
can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?”
Harry shook his head.
“Let me explain. The happiest man on earth would be able to use the
Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it and see
himself exactly as he is. Does that help?”
Harry thought. Then he said slo otter. I need to examine this interesting mirror.”
It was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell. It
was the Mirror of Erised.
“This mirror is the key to finding the Stone,” Quirrell murmured, tapping
his way around the frame. “Trust Dumbledore to come up with something like
this . . . but he’s in London . . . I’ll be far away by the time he gets back. . . .”
All Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and stop him
from concentrating on the mirror.
“I saw you and Sna is is a two-way mirror. I’ve got the other. If you need to speak to me,
just say my name into it; you’ll appear in my mirror and I’ll be able to
talk in yours. James and I used to use them when we were in separate
detentions.
And Harry’s heart began to race. He remembered seeing his dead parents in
the Mirror of Erised four years ago. He was going to be able to talk to Sirius

Hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on
her. Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off
them, but the more they strained against it, the tighter and faster the plant
wound around them.
“Stop moving!” Hermione ordered them. “I know what this is — it’s

He sat up and felt around, his eyes not used to the gloom. It felt as though he
was sitting on some sort of plant.
“It’s okay!” he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp, which was
the open trapdoor, “it’s a soft landing, you can jump!”
Ron followed right away. He landed, sprawled next to Harry.
“What’s this stuff?” were his first words.“Dunno, some sort of plant thing. I suppose it’s here to break the fall. Come

He passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry he had never tasted
anything so wonderful, but he still couldn’t take his eyes off the giant. Finally,
as nobody seemed about to explain anything, he said, “I’m sorry, but I still
don’t really know who you are.”
The giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand.
“Call me Hagrid,” he  debating the ways in which Dumbledore might stop those who
were under seventeen from entering the tournament.
“Who’s this impartial judge who’s going to decide who the champions
are?” said Harry.
“Dunno,” said Fred, “but it’s them we’ll have to fool. I reckon a couple of
drops of Aging Potion might do it, George. . . .”
“Dumbledore knows you’re not of age, though,” said Ron.“Yeah, but he’s not the one who decides who the champion is, is he?” said
Fred shrewdly. “Sounds to me like once this judge knows who w oduced him to the wizards on

From the moment the article had appeared, Harry had had to endure people

comments.
“Want a hanky, Potter, in case you start crying in Transfiguration?”
