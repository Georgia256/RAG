Who is Harry Potter's best friend?,Ron Weasley,"According to the context, Harry Potter's best friends are Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley.","
sniggered, but Slughorn showed no dismay; on the contrary, he beamed and
looked from Hermione to Harry, who was sitting next to her.
“Oho! 
‘One of my best friends is Muggle-born, and she’s the best in our
year!’
 I’m assuming this is the very friend of whom you spoke, Harry?”
“Yes, sir,” said Harry.
“Well, well, take twenty well-earned points for Gryffindor, Miss Granger,”
said Slughorn genially.
Malfoy looked rather as he had done the time Hermione had punched him
in the face. Hermione turned to Harry with a radiant expression and
whispered, “Did you really tell him I’m the best in the year? Oh, Harry!”
“Well, what’s so impressive about that?” whispered Ron, who for somereason looked annoyed. “You 
are
 the best in the year — I’d’ve told him so if
he’d asked me!”
Hermione smiled but made a “shhing” gesture, so that they could hear what
Slughorn was saying. Ron looked slightly disgruntled.
“Amortentia doesn’t really create 
love,
 of course. It is impossible to
manufacture or imitate love. No, this will sim say you remember him at Hogwarts, Rosmerta,” murmured Professor
McGonagall. “Do you remember who his best friend was?”
“Naturally,” said Madam Rosmerta, with a small laugh. “Never saw one
without the other, did you? The number of times I had them in here — ooh,
they used to make me laugh. Quite the double act, Sirius Black and James
Potter!”
Harry dropped his tankard with a loud clunk. Ron kicked him.
“Precisely,” said Professor McGonagall. “Black and Potter. Ringleaders of
their little gang. Both very bright, of course — exceptionally bright, in fact —
but I don’t think we’ve ever had such a pair of troublemakers —”
“I dunno,” chuckled Hagrid. “Fred and George Weasley could give ’em a
run fer their money.”
“You’d have thought Black and Potter were brothers!” chimed in Professor
Flitwick. “Inseparable!”
“Of course they were,” said Fudge. “Potter trusted Black beyond all his
other friends. Nothing changed when they left school. Black was best man
when James married Lily. Then they named him godfather to Harry. . Again, your readers will have to buy my book for the
whole story, but there is no question that Dumbledore took an unnatural
interest in Potter from the word go. Whether that was really in the boy’s
best interests — well, we’ll see. It’s certainly an open secret that Potter
has had a most troubled adolescence.”
I ask whether Skeeter is still in touch with Harry Potter, whom she so
famously interviewed last year: a breakthrough piece in which Potter
spoke exclusively of his conviction that You-Know-Who had returned.
“Oh, yes, we’ve developed a close bond,” says Skeeter. “Poor Potter
has few real friends, and we met at one of the most testing moments of
his life — the Triwizard Tournament. I am probably one of the only
people alive who can say that they know the real Harry Potter.”
Which leads us neatly to the many rumors still circulating about
Dumbledore’s final hours. Does Skeeter believe that Potter was there
when Dumbledore died?
“Well, I don’t want to say too much — it’s all in the book — but

What house is Harry Potter sorted into?,Gryffindor,"According to the passage, Harry Potter is sorted into Gryffindor House.","rom a doorway to the right — the
rest of the school must already be here — but Professor McGonagall showed
the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in,
standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering
about nervously.
“Welcome to Hogwarts,” said Professor McGonagall. “The start-of-term
banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall,
you will be sorted into your Houses. The Sorting is a very importantceremony because, while you are here, your House will be something like
your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your
House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free time in your House
common room.
“The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and
Slytherin. Each House has its own noble history and each has produced
outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs
will earn your House points, while any rule-breaking will lose House points.
At the end of the  you are here, your House will be something like

outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs
will earn your House points, while any rule-breaking will lose House points.
At the end of the year, the House with the most points is awarded the House
Cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever House
becomes yours.
“The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest
of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can
while you are waiting.”
Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville’s cloak, which was fastened
under his left ear, and on Ron’s smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to
flatten his hair.
“I shall return when we are r  sir!” she said in a muffled squeak. “No, no, no. I
says to Dobby, I says, go find yourself a nice family and settle down, Dobby.
He is getting up to all sorts of high jinks, sir, what is unbecoming to a house-
elf. You goes racketing around like this, Dobby, I says, and next thing I hear
you’s up in front of the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical
Creatures, like some common goblin.”“Well, it’s about time he had a bit of fun,” said Harry.
“House-elves is not supposed to have fun, Harry Potter,” said Winky
firmly, from behind her hands. “House-elves does what they is told. I is not
liking heights at all, Harry Potter” — she glanced toward the edge of the box
and gulped — “but my master sends me to the Top Box and I comes, sir.”
“Why’s he sent you up here, if he knows you don’t like heights?” said
Harry, frowning.
“Master — master wants me to save him a seat, Harry Potter. He is very
busy,” said Winky, tilting her head toward the empty space beside her.
“Winky is wishing she is back in master’"

If ever you need me, send word. Your owl will find me.
I’ll write again soon.
Sirius
Harry looked eagerly inside the envelope. There was another piece of
parchment in there. He read it through quickly and felt suddenly as warm and
contented as though he’d swallowed a bottle of hot butterbeer in one gulp.
I, Sirius Black, Harry Potter’s godfather, hereby give him permission to
visit Hogsmeade on weekends.
“That’ll be good enough for Dumbledore!” said Harry happily. He looked
back at Sirius’s letter.
“Hang on, there’s a P.S. . . .”
I thought your friend Ron might like to keep this owl, as it’s my fault
he no longer has a rat.
Ron’s eyes widened. The minute owl was still hooting excitedly.
“Keep him?” he said uncertainly. He looked closely at the owl for a
moment; then, to Harry’s and Hermione’s great surprise, he held him out for
Crookshanks to sniff.
“What d’you reckon?” Ron asked the cat. “Definitely an owl?”Crookshanks purred.
“That’s good enough for me,” said Ron happily. “He’s He
brought it carefully inside. The owl dropped its letter onto Harry’s seat and
began zooming around their compartment, apparently very pleased with itself
for accomplishing its task. Hedwig clicked her beak with a sort of dignified
disapproval. Crookshanks sat up in his seat, following the owl with his great
yellow eyes. Ron, noticing this, snatched the owl safely out of harm’s way.
Harry picked up the letter. It was addressed to him. He ripped open the
letter, and shouted, “It’s from Sirius!”
“What?” said Ron and Hermione excitedly. “Read it aloud!”
Dear Harry,
I hope this finds you before you reach your aunt and uncle. I don’t
know whether they’re used to owl post.
Buckbeak and I are in hiding. I won’t tell you where, in case this falls
into the wrong hands. I have some doubt about the owl’s reliability, but
he is the best I could find, and he did seem eager for the job.
I believe the dementors are still searching for me, but they haven’t a
hope of finding me here. I am planning to allow some Muggles to
g er his shoulder. “What’s thatthing outside your window?”
Harry turned to look outside. Something very small and gray was bobbing
in and out of sight beyond the glass. He stood up for a better look and saw
that it was a tiny owl, carrying a letter that was much too big for it. The owl
was so small, in fact, that it kept tumbling over in the air, buffeted this way
and that in the train’s slipstream. Harry quickly pulled down the window,
stretched out his arm, and caught it. It felt like a very fluffy Snitch. He
brought it carefully inside. The owl dropped its letter onto Harry’s seat and
began zooming around their compartment, apparently very pleased with itself
for accomplishing its task. Hedwig clicked her beak with a sort of dignified
disapproval. Crookshanks sat up in his seat, following the owl with his great
yellow eyes. Ron, noticing this, snatched the owl safely out of harm’s way.

Who is the headmaster of Hogwarts?,Albus Dumbledore,"According to the passage, Severus Snape is confirmed as the new Headmaster of Hogwarts after Dumbledore's death.","dunno . . . Hogwarts without Dumbledore . . .” He gulped and
disappeared behind his handkerchief once more, and there was silence.
“Very well,” said Professor McGonagall, glancing out of the window at thegrounds, checking to see whether the Minister was yet approaching, “then I
must agree with Filius that the right thing to do is to consult the governors,
who will make the final decision.
“Now, as to getting students home . . . there is an argument for doing it
sooner rather than later. We could arrange for the Hogwarts Express to come
tomorrow if necessary —”
“What about Dumbledore’s funeral?” said Harry, speaking at last.
“Well . . .” said Professor McGonagall, losing a little of her briskness as her
voice shook. “I — I know that it was Dumbledore’s wish to be laid to rest
here, at Hogwarts —”
“Then that’s what’ll happen, isn’t it?” said Harry fiercely.
“If the Ministry thinks it appropriate,” said Professor McGonagall. “No
other headmaster or headmistress has ever been —”
“No other headmaster or headmistre red
parchment.
A large picture of a familiar, hook-nosed, black-haired man stared up at
them all, beneath a headline that read:
SEVERUS SNAPE CONFIRMED AS HOGWARTS HEADMASTER
“No!” said Ron and Hermione loudly.
Hermione was quickest; she snatched up the newspaper and began to read
the accompanying story out loud.
“‘Severus Snape, long-standing Potions master at Hogwarts School of
Witchcraft and Wizardry, was today appointed headmaster in the most
important of several staffing changes at the ancient school. Following the
resignation of the previous Muggle Studies teacher, Alecto Carrow will take
over the post while her brother, Amycus, fills the position of Defense Against
the Dark Arts professor.
“
‘I welcome the opportunity to uphold our finest Wizarding traditions and
values —’ 
Like committing murder and cutting off people’s ears, I suppose!
Snape, headmaster! Snape in Dumbledore’s study — Merlin’s pants!” she
shrieked, making both Harry and Ron jump. She leapt up from the table and
hurtled from the room,  he had just been appointed Head Boy. Harry didn’t realize what he was so
pleased about until the Potions lesson about two weeks after Dumbledore and
Hagrid had left, when, sitting right behind Malfoy, Harry overheard him
gloating to Crabbe and Goyle.
“I always thought Father might be the one who got rid of Dumbledore,” he
said, not troubling to keep his voice down. “I told you he thinks
Dumbledore’s the worst headmaster the school’s ever had. Maybe we’ll get a
decent headmaster now. Someone who won’t 
want
 the Chamber of Secrets
closed. McGonagall won’t last long, she’s only filling in. . . .”
Snape swept past Harry, making no comment about Hermione’s empty seat
and cauldron.
“Sir,” said Malfoy loudly. “Sir, why don’t 
you 
apply for the headmaster’s
job?”
“Now, now, Malfoy,” said Snape, though he couldn’t suppress a thin-lipped
smile. “Professor Dumbledore has only been suspended by the governors. I
daresay he’ll be back with us soon enough.”
“Yeah, right,” said Malfoy, smirking. “I expect you’d have Father"
What spell is used to disarm an opponent?,Expelliarmus,"According to the passage, the spell used to disarm an opponent is not explicitly stated. However, it is mentioned that Lockhart shouted ""I said Disarm only!"" during the duel, implying that the spell should be used to disarm the opponent, but not to harm them."," Slytherin girl who
reminded Harry of a picture he’d seen in 
Holidays with Hags.
 She was large
and square and her heavy jaw jutted aggressively. Hermione gave her a weak
smile that she did not return.
“Face your partners!” called Lockhart, back on the platform. “And bow!”
Harry and Malfoy barely inclined their heads, not taking their eyes off each
other.
“Wands at the ready!” shouted Lockhart. “When I count to three, cast your
charms to Disarm your opponents — 
only
 to disarm them — we don’t want
any accidents — one . . . two . . . three —”
Harry swung his wand high, but Malfoy had already started on “two”: His
spell hit Harry so hard he felt as though he’d been hit over the head with a
saucepan. He stumbled, but everything still seemed to be working, and
wasting no more time, Harry pointed his wand straight at Malfoy and shouted,
“Rictusempra!”A jet of silver light hit Malfoy in the stomach and he doubled up, wheezing.
“I said Disarm only!”
 Lockhart shouted in alarm over the heads of the
battling crowd,  it before — I DID IT!”
“Good one!” said Harry encouragingly, deciding not to point out that in a
real duel situation Neville’s opponent was unlikely to be staring in the
opposite direction with his wand held loosely at his side. “Listen, Neville, can
you take it in turns to practice with Ron and Hermione for a couple of minutes
so I can walk around and see how the rest are doing?”
Harry moved off into the middle of the room. Something very odd was
happening to Zacharias Smith; every time he opened his mouth to disarm
Anthony Goldstein, his own wand would fly out of his hand, yet Anthony did
not seem to be making a sound. Harry did not have to look far for the solution
of the mystery, however; Fred and George were several feet from Smith and
taking it in turns to point their wands at his back.
“Sorry, Harry,” said George hastily, when Harry caught his eye. “Couldn’t
resist . . .”
Harry walked around the other pairs, trying to correct those who were
doing the spell wrong. Ginny was teamed with Michael Corner; s ed through the crowd, matching up partners. Lockhart teamed
Neville with Justin Finch-Fletchley, but Snape reached Harry and Ron first.
“Time to split up the dream team, I think,” he sneered. “Weasley, you can
partner Finnigan. Potter —”
Harry moved automatically toward Hermione.
“I don’t think so,” said Snape, smiling coldly. “Mr. Malfoy, come over
here. Let’s see what you make of the famous Potter. And you, Miss Granger
— you can partner Miss Bulstrode.”
Malfoy strutted over, smirking. Behind him walked a Slytherin girl who
reminded Harry of a picture he’d seen in 
Holidays with Hags.
 She was large
and square and her heavy jaw jutted aggressively. Hermione gave her a weak
smile that she did not return.

“Those two Death Eaters who teach here?”
“They do more than teach,” said Neville. “They’re in charge of all
discipline. They like punishment, the Carrows.”
“Like Umbridge?”
“Nah, they make her look tame. The other teachers are all supposed to refer
us to the Carrows if we do anything wrong. They don’t, though, if they can
avoid it. You can tell they all hate them as much as we do.
“Amycus, the bloke, he teaches what used to be Defense Against the Dark
Arts, except now it’s just the Dark Arts. We’re supposed to practice the
Cruciatus Curse on people who’ve earned detentions —”
“What?”
Harry, Ron, and Hermione’s united voices echoed up and down the
passage.
“Yeah,” said Neville. “That’s how I got this one,” he pointed at a
particularly deep gash in his cheek, “I refused to do it. Some people are into
it, though; Crabbe and Goyle love it. First time they’ve ever been top in

The word echoed all over the Hall as people wondered whether they had

“Potions?” said Ron and Hermione together, turning to stare at Harry. “But
you said —”
“Professor Snape, meanwhile,” said Dumbledore, raising his voice so that it
carried over all the muttering, “will be taking over the position of Defense
Against the Dark Arts teacher.”
“No!” said Harry, so loudly that many heads turned in his direction. He didnot care; he was staring up at the staff table, incensed. How could Snape be
given the Defense Against the Dark Arts job after all this time? Hadn’t it been
widely known for years that Dumbledore did it by now, though . . . or
Madam Pomfrey would’ve done.”

Harry’s brain seemed to have jammed. He stared numbly at Riddle, at the

CHAPTER  ONE
THE BOY WHO LIVED
r. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say
that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much now-Who’s sign!”
“Voldemort’s — ?”
“Harry, come 
on
!”
Harry turned — Ron was hurriedly scooping up his miniature Krum — the
three of them started across the clearing — but before they had taken a few
hurried steps, a series of popping noises announced the arrival of twenty
wizards, appearing from thin air, surrounding them.
Harry whirled around, and in an instant, he registered one fact: Each of
these wizards had his wand out, and every wand was pointing right at himself,
Ron, and Hermione.
Without pausing to think, he yelled, “DUCK!”
He seized the other two and pulled them down onto the ground.
“STUPEFY!”
 roared twenty voices — there was a blinding series of
flashes and Harry felt the hair on his head ripple as though a powerful wind
had swept the clearing. Raising his head a fraction of an inch he saw jets of
fiery red light flying over them from the wizards’ wands, crossing one
another, bouncing off tree trunks, rebounding into the darkness —
“Stop!” yelled a voice he recognized. “STOP! 
That’s my son!
” hen she reached the end of the page she looked up at him.
“Oh, Harry . . .”“And there’s this too.”
He handed her the torn photograph, and Hermione smiled at the baby
zooming in and out of sight on the toy broom.
“I’ve been looking for the rest of the letter,” Harry said, “but it’s not here.”
Hermione glanced around.
“Did you make all this mess, or was some of it done when you got here?”
“Someone had searched before me,” said Harry.
“I thought so. Every room I looked into on the way up had been disturbed.
What were they after, do you think?”
“Information on the Order, if it was Snape.”
“But you’d think he’d already have all he needed, I mean, he was 
in 
the
Order, wasn’t he?”
“Well then,” said Harry, keen to discuss his theory, “what about
information on Dumbledore? The second page of this letter, for instance. You
know this Bathilda my mum mentions, you know who she is?”
“Who?”
“Bathilda Bagshot, the author of —”
“
A History of Magic,

knew her? She was an"
What platform do students use to board the Hogwarts Express?,Platform 9 3/4,"According to the passage, students use Platform 9 3/4 to board the Hogwarts Express.","dumped Harry’s
trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him. Harry thought this
was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, facing the platforms
with a nasty grin on his face.
“Well, there you are, boy. Platform nine — platform ten. Your platform
should be somewhere in the middle, but they don’t seem to have built it yet,
do they?”
He was quite right, of course. There was a big plastic number nine over one
platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it, and in the
middle, nothing at all.
“Have a good term,” said Uncle Vernon with an even nastier smile. He left
without another word. Harry turned and saw the Dursleys drive away. All
three of them were laughing. Harry’s mouth went rather dry. What on earth
was he going to do? He was starting to attract a lot of funny looks, because of
Hedwig. He’d have to ask someone.
He stopped a passing guard, but didn’t dare mention platform nine and
three-quarters. The guard had never heard of Hogwarts and when Harry
couldn’t even tell him ough onto
platform nine and three quarters, where the Hogwarts Express stood belching
sooty steam over a platform packed with departing students and their families.Harry inhaled the familiar smell and felt his spirits soar. . . . He was really
going back. . . .
“I hope the others make it in time,” said Mrs. Weasley anxiously, staring
behind her at the wrought-iron arch spanning the platform, through which
new arrivals would come.
“Nice dog, Harry!” called a tall boy with dreadlocks.
“Thanks, Lee,” said Harry, grinning, as Sirius wagged his tail frantically.
“Oh good,” said Mrs. Weasley, sounding relieved, “here’s Alastor with the
luggage, look . . .”
A porter’s cap pulled low over his mismatched eyes, Moody came limping
through the archway pushing a cart full of their trunks.
“All okay,” he muttered to Mrs. Weasley and Tonks. “Don’t think we were
followed . . .”
Seconds later, Mr. Weasley emerged onto the platform with Ron and
Hermione. They had almost unloaded Moody’s luggage cart when Fred,
George, and Ginn  ten. The only tricky part was doing this in an
unobtrusive way, so as to avoid attracting Muggle attention. They did it in
groups today; Harry, Ron, and Hermione (the most conspicuous, since they
were accompanied by Pigwidgeon and Crookshanks) went first; they leaned
casually against the barrier, chatting unconcernedly, and slid sideways
through it . . . and as they did so, platform nine and three-quarters
materialized in front of them.
The Hogwarts Express, a gleaming scarlet steam engine, was already there,
clouds of steam billowing from it, through which the many Hogwarts students
and parents on the platform appeared like dark ghosts. Pigwidgeon became
noisier than ever in response to the hooting of many owls through the mist.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione set off to find seats, and were soon stowing their
luggage in a compartment halfway along the train. They then hopped back
down onto the platform to say good-bye to Mrs. Weasley, Bill, and Charlie.
“I might be seeing you all sooner than you think,” said Char"
What is the name of Harry's godfather?,Sirius Black,"According to the text, Harry's godfather is Sirius Black, who is also a convicted murderer."," mine.”
Harry read and reread the letter from Sirius all the way back into King’s
Cross station. It was still clutched tightly in his hand as he, Ron, and
Hermione stepped back through the barrier of platform nine and three-
quarters. Harry spotted Uncle Vernon at once. He was standing a good
distance from Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, eyeing them suspiciously, and when
Mrs. Weasley hugged Harry in greeting, his worst suspicions about them
seemed confirmed.
“I’ll call about the World Cup!” Ron yelled after Harry as Harry bid him
and Hermione good-bye, then wheeled the trolley bearing his trunk and
Hedwig’s cage toward Uncle Vernon, who greeted him in his usual fashion.
“What’s that?” he snarled, staring at the envelope Harry was still clutching
in his hand. “If it’s another form for me to sign, you’ve got another —”

“Godfather?” spluttered Uncle Vernon. “You haven’t got a godfather!”
“Yes, I have,” said Harry brightly. “He was my mum and dad’s best  Harry bid him
and Hermione good-bye, then wheeled the trolley bearing his trunk and
Hedwig’s cage toward Uncle Vernon, who greeted him in his usual fashion.
“What’s that?” he snarled, staring at the envelope Harry was still clutching
in his hand. “If it’s another form for me to sign, you’ve got another —”
“It’s not,” said Harry cheerfully. “It’s a letter from my godfather.”
“Godfather?” spluttered Uncle Vernon. “You haven’t got a godfather!”
“Yes, I have,” said Harry brightly. “He was my mum and dad’s best friend.
He’s a convicted murderer, but he’s broken out of Wizard prison and he’s on
the run. He likes to keep in touch with me, though . . . keep up with my
news . . . check if I’m happy. . . .”
And, grinning broadly at the look of horror on Uncle Vernon’s face, Harry
set off toward the station exit, Hedwig rattling along in front of him, for what
looked like a much better summer than the last.

“You see?” he whispered. “It was a name I was already using at Hogwarts,
to my most intimate friends only, of course. You think I was going to use my
filthy Muggle father’s name forever? I, in whose veins runs the blood of
Salazar Slytherin himself, through my mother’s side? I, keep the name of a
foul, common Muggle, who abandoned me even before I was born, just
because he found out his wife was a witch? No, Harry — I fashioned myself a
new name, a name I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak,when I had become the greatest sorcerer in the world!”
Harry’s brain seemed to have jammed. He stared numbly at Riddle, at the
orphaned boy who had grown up to murder Harry’s own parents, and so many
others. . . . At last he forced himself to speak.
“You’re not,” he said, his quiet voice full of hatred.
“Not what?” snapped Riddle.
“Not the greatest sorcerer in the world,” said Harry, breathing fast. “Sorry
to disappoint you and all that, but the grea"

“Well, as regular listeners will know, several of the more outspoken
supporters of Harry Potter have now been imprisoned, including Xenophilius

“At least he’s still alive!” muttered Ron.
“We have also heard within the last few hours that Rubeus Hagrid” — all
three of them gasped, and so nearly missed the rest of the sentence — “well-
known gamekeeper at Hogwarts School, has narrowly escaped arrest within
the grounds of Hogwarts, where he is rumored to have hosted a ‘Support
Harry Potter’ party in his house. However, Hagrid was not taken into custody,
and is, we believe, on the run.”
“I suppose it helps, when escaping from Death Eaters, if you’ve got a
sixteen-foot-high half brother?” asked Lee.
“It would tend to give you an edge,” agreed Lupin gravely. “May I just add

Handbook of Do-It-Yourself Broomcare.
Apart from his friends, the thing that Harry missed most about Hogwarts
was Quidditch, the most popular sport in the magical world — highly
dangerous, very exciting, and played on broomsticks. Harry happened to be a
very good Quidditch player; he had been the youngest person in a century to
be picked for one of the Hogwarts House teams. One of Harry’s most prized
possessions was his Nimbus Two Thousand racing broom.
Harry put the leather case aside and picked up his last parcel. He
recognized the untidy scrawl on the brown paper at once: This was from
Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper. He tore off the top layer of paper and
glimpsed something green and leathery, but before he could unwrap it
properly, the parcel gave a strange quiver, and whatever was inside it snapped
loudly — as though it had jaws.
Harry froze. He knew that Hagrid would w. Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two
large ice creams to show he couldn’t come in.
“That’s Hagrid,” said Harry, pleased to know something the boy didn’t.
“He works at Hogwarts.”
“Oh,” said the boy, “I’ve heard of him. He’s a sort of servant, isn’t he?”
“He’s the gamekeeper,” said Harry. He was liking the boy less and less
every second.
“Yes, exactly. I heard he’s a sort of 
savage
 — lives in a hut on the school
grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up
setting fire to his bed.”
“I think he’s brilliant,” said Harry coldly.
“
Do
 you?” said the boy, with a slight sneer. “Why is he with you? Where
are your parents?”
“They’re dead,” said Harry shortly. He didn’t feel much like going into the
matter with this boy.
“Oh, sorry,” said the other, not sounding sorry at all. “But they were 
ourkind, weren’t they?”
“They were a witch and wizard, if that’s what you mean.”
“I really don’t think they should let the other sort in, do you? They’re just

somewhere, couldn’t he?” said Hermione reasonably. “Hedwig’s not going to
manage 
that
 journey in a few days.”
“Yeah, I know,” said Harry, but there was a leaden feeling in his stomach as
he looked out of the window at the Hedwig-free sky.
“Come and have a game of Quidditch in the orchard, Harry,” said Ron.
“Come on — three on three, Bill and Charlie and Fred and George will
play. . . . You can try out the Wronski Feint. . . .”
“Ron,” said Hermione, in an I-don’t-think-you’re-being-very-sensitive sortof voice, “Harry doesn’t want to play Quidditch right now. . . . He’s worried,
and he’s tired. . . . We all need to go to bed. . . .”
“Yeah, I want to play Quidditch,” said Harry suddenly. “Hang on, I’ll get
my Firebolt.”
Hermione left the room, muttering something that sounded very much like
“Boys.”
Neither Mr. Weasley nor Percy was at home much over the following week.
Both left the house each morning before the rest of the family got up, and
returned well after dinner e , but he had another reason for not
wanting Snape near him while he was playing Quidditch. . . .
The rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of
practice, but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common room,
where he found Ron and Hermione playing chess. Chess was the only thing
Hermione ever lost at, something Harry and Ron thought was very good for
her.
“Don’t talk to me for a moment,” said Ron when Harry sat down next to
him, “I need to concen —” He caught sight of Harry’s face. “What’s the
matter with you? You look terrible.”
Speaking quietly so that no one else would hear, Harry told the other two
about Snape’s sudden, sinister desire to be a Quidditch referee.
“Don’t play,” said Hermione at once.“Say you’re ill,” said Ron.
“Pretend to break your leg,” Hermione suggested.
“
Really
 break your leg,” said Ron.
“I can’t,” said Harry. “There isn’t a reserve Seeker. If I back out, Gryffindor
can’t play at all.”
At that moment Neville toppled into the common room. How he h f the pitch it was to a storm of catcalls
and jeers from the Slytherin Quidditch team and assorted hangers-on, who
were grouped halfway up the empty stands and whose voices echoed loudly
around the stadium.
“What’s that Weasley’s riding?” Malfoy called in his sneering drawl. “Why
would anyone put a Flying Charm on a moldy old log like that?”
Crabbe, Goyle, and Pansy Parkinson guffawed and shrieked with laughter.
Ron mounted his broom and kicked off from the ground and Harry followed
him, watching his ears turn red from behind.
“Ignore them,” he said, accelerating to catch up with Ron. “We’ll see who’s
laughing after we play them . . .”
“Exactly the attitude I want, Harry,” said Angelina approvingly, soaring
around them with the Quaffle under her arm and slowing to hover on the spot
in front of her airborne team. “Okay everyone, we’re going to start with some
passes just to warm up, the whole team please —”
“Hey, Johnson, what’s with that hairstyle anyway?” shrieked Pansy
Parkinson from below. “Why would anyon"

bottom of the stairs, where Nearly Headless Nick, ghost of Gryffindor Tower,
stood waiting for him.
“Harry! My dear boy!”Nick made to grasp Harry’s hands with both of his own: Harry’s felt as
though they had been thrust into icy water.
“Nick, you’ve got to help me. Who’s the ghost of Ravenclaw Tower?”
Nearly Headless Nick looked surprised and a little offended.
“The Gray Lady, of course; but if it is ghostly services you require — ?”
“It’s got to be her — d’you know where she is?”
“Let’s see. . . .”
Nick’s head wobbled a little on his ruff as he turned hither and thither,
peering over the heads of the swarming students.
“That’s her over there, Harry, the young woman with the long hair.”
Harry looked in the direction of Nick’s transparent, pointing finger and saw
a tall ghost who caught sight of Harry looking at her, raised her eyebrows, and
drifted away through a solid wall.
Harry ran after her. Once through the door of the corridor into which she
had disappeared, he saw her at the very end of the p tarved Harry, but he’d never been allowed
to eat as much as he liked. Dudley had always taken anything that Harry
really wanted, even if it made him sick. Harry piled his plate with a bit of
everything except the peppermints and began to eat. It was all delicious.
“That does look good,” said the ghost in the ruff sadly, watching Harry cut
up his steak.
“Can’t you — ?”
“I haven’t eaten for nearly five hundred years,” said the ghost. “I don’t
need to, of course, but one does miss it. I don’t think I’ve introduced myself?
Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington at your service. Resident ghost of
Gryffindor Tower.”
“I know who you are!” said Ron suddenly. “My brothers told me about you
— you’re Nearly Headless Nick!”
“I would 
prefer
 you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy —” the ghost began
stiffly, but sandy-haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted.
“
Nearly
 Headless? How can you be 
nearly
 headless?”
Sir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little chat wasn’t going at
all the way he wanted.
“Like 
this,
” he said   you are here, your House will be something like
your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your
House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free time in your House
common room.
“The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and
Slytherin. Each House has its own noble history and each has produced
outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs
will earn your House points, while any rule-breaking will lose House points.
At the end of the year, the House with the most points is awarded the House
Cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever House
becomes yours.
“The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest
of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can
while you are waiting.”
Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville’s cloak, which was fastened
under his left ear, and on Ron’s smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to
flatten his hair.

What magical creature pulls the carriages to Hogwarts?,Thestrals,"According to the book, the magical creature that pulls the carriages to Hogwarts is not specified. However, it is mentioned that ""a hundred horseless carriages"" are waiting for the students outside the station, suggesting that they are somehow magically propelled without the use of horses.",", I wouldn’t fancy crossing the lake in this weather,” said Hermione
fervently, shivering as they inched slowly along the dark platform with the
rest of the crowd. A hundred horseless carriages stood waiting for them
outside the station. Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Neville climbed gratefully into
one of them, the door shut with a snap, and a few moments later, with a great
lurch, the long procession of carriages was rumbling and splashing its way up
the track toward Hogwarts Castle.T
 
CHAPTER  TWELVE
THE TRIWIZARD TOURNAMENT
hrough the gates, flanked with statues of winged boars, and up the
sweeping drive the carriages trundled, swaying dangerously in what
was fast becoming a gale. Leaning against the window, Harry could see
Hogwarts coming nearer, its many lighted windows blurred and shimmering
behind the thick curtain of rain. Lightning flashed across the sky as their
carriage came to a halt before the great oak front doors, which stood at the top
of a flight of stone steps. People who had occupied the carri flustered, and
following Krum through the crowd and out of sight.
“You’d better hurry up!” Ron called loudly after her. “The carriages’ll be
here in a minute!”
He let Harry keep a watch for the carriages, however, and spent the next
few minutes craning his neck over the crowd to try and see what Krum and
Hermione might be up to. They returned quite soon. Ron stared at Hermione,
but her face was quite impassive.
“I liked Diggory,” said Krum abruptly to Harry. “He vos alvays polite to
me. Alvays. Even though I vos from Durmstrang — with Karkaroff,” he
added, scowling.
“Have you got a new headmaster yet?” said Harry.Krum shrugged. He held out his hand as Fleur had done, shook Harry’s
hand, and then Ron’s. Ron looked as though he was suffering some sort of
painful internal struggle. Krum had already started walking away when Ron
burst out, “Can I have your autograph?”
Hermione turned away, smiling at the horseless carriages that were now
trundling toward them up the drive, as Krum, looking surprised but gratified  frightened. Harry could not see
why. The hall was quite empty but for themselves, the sobbing Bellatrix still
trapped under her statue, and the tiny baby Fawkes croaking feebly on the
floor —
And then Harry’s scar burst open. He knew he was dead: it was pain
beyond imagining, pain past endurance —
He was gone from the hall, he was locked in the coils of a creature with red
eyes, so tightly bound that Harry did not know where his body ended and the
creature’s began. They were fused together, bound by pain, and there was no
escape —
And when the creature spoke, it used Harry’s mouth, so that in his agony he
felt his jaw move. . . .
“Kill me now, Dumbledore . . .”
Blinded and dying, every part of him screaming for release, Harry felt the
creature use him again. . . .
“If death is nothing, Dumbledore, kill the boy . . .”Let the pain stop,
 thought Harry. 
Let him kill us. . . . End it,
Dumbledore. . . . Death is nothing compared to this. . . .
And I’ll see Sirius again. . . .

What is the name of the house elf who serves the Malfoy family?,Dobby,"The house-elf who serves the Malfoy family is not explicitly mentioned by name in this context. However, we do know that the Malfoys own a house-elf, as mentioned by Harry and the Weasley twins."," Malfoy made Dudley Dursley look like a kind,
thoughtful, and sensitive boy.
“I don’t know whether the Malfoys own a house-elf. . . .” said Harry.
“Well, whoever owns him will be an old Wizarding family, and they’ll be
rich,” said Fred.
“Yeah, Mum’s always wishing we had a house-elf to do the ironing,” said
George. “But all we’ve got is a lousy old ghoul in the attic and gnomes all
over the garden. House-elves come with big old manors and castles and
places like that; you wouldn’t catch one in our house. . . .”Harry was silent. Judging by the fact that Draco Malfoy usually had the
best of everything, his family was rolling in wizard gold; he could just see
Malfoy strutting around a large manor house. Sending the family servant to
stop Harry from going back to Hogwarts also sounded exactly like the sort of
thing Malfoy would do. Had Harry been stupid to take Dobby seriously?
“I’m glad we came to get you, anyway,” said Ron. “I was getting really
worried when you didn’t answer any of my letters. I thought it was e, turning around. “Not Lucius Malfoy’s son?”
“Must be, it’s not a very common name, is it?” said Harry. “Why?”
“I’ve heard Dad talking about him,” said George. “He was a big supporter
of You-Know-Who.”
“And when You-Know-Who disappeared,” said Fred, craning around to
look at Harry, “Lucius Malfoy came back saying he’d never meant any of it.
Load of dung — Dad reckons he was right in You-Know-Who’s inner circle.”
Harry had heard these rumors about Malfoy’s family before, and they
didn’t surprise him at all. Malfoy made Dudley Dursley look like a kind,
thoughtful, and sensitive boy.
“I don’t know whether the Malfoys own a house-elf. . . .” said Harry.

screech and was beating her wings wildly against the bars of her cage.“Dobby had to punish himself, sir,” said the elf, who had gone slightly
cross-eyed. “Dobby almost spoke ill of his family, sir. . . .”
“Your family?”
“The wizard family Dobby serves, sir. . . . Dobby is a house-elf — bound to
serve one house and one family forever. . . .”
“Do they know you’re here?” asked Harry curiously.
Dobby shuddered.
“Oh, no, sir, no . . . Dobby will have to punish himself most grievously for
coming to see you, sir. Dobby will have to shut his ears in the oven door for
this. If they ever knew, sir —”
“But won’t they notice if you shut your ears in the oven door?”
“Dobby doubts it, sir. Dobby is always having to punish himself for
something, sir. They lets Dobby get on with it, sir. Sometimes they reminds
me to do extra punishments. . . .”
“But why don’t you leave? Escape?”

free . . . Dobby will serve the family until"
Who is the Half-Blood Prince?,Severus Snape,"According to the text, the identity of the Half-Blood Prince is not explicitly stated. However, Hermione Granger suggests that it could be a nickname or a title, and she even proposes a theory that it might be the name of a half-blood wizard whose father was a wizard and whose mother was a Muggle.","h the picture
belonged; it was a rather dull story about interschool competitions.
“Her name was Eileen Prince. 
Prince,
 Harry.”
They looked at each other, and Harry realized what Hermione was trying to
say. He burst out laughing.
“No way.”
“What?”
“You think 
she
 was the Half-Blood . . . ? Oh, come on.”
“Well, why not? Harry, there aren’t any real princes in the Wizarding
world! It’s either a nickname, a made-up title somebody’s given themselves,
or it could be their actual name, couldn’t it? No, listen! If, say, her father wasa wizard whose surname was Prince, and her mother was a Muggle, then that
would make her a ‘half-blood Prince’!”
“Yeah, very ingenious, Hermione . . .”
“But it would! Maybe she was proud of being half a Prince!”
“Listen, Hermione, I can tell it’s not a girl. I can just tell.”
“The truth is that you don’t think a girl would have been clever enough,”
said Hermione angrily.
“How can I have hung round with you for five years and not think girls are
clever?” said Harry, stung by this. “It rmione, meanwhile, was resolutely plowing on
with what she called the “official” instructions, but becoming increasingly
bad-tempered as they yielded poorer results than the Prince’s.
Harry wondered vaguely who the Half-Blood Prince had been. Although
the amount of homework they had been given prevented him from reading the
whole of his copy of 
Advanced Potion-Making,
 he had skimmed through it
sufficiently to see that there was barely a page on which the Prince had not
made additional notes, not all of them concerned with potion-making. Here
and there were directions for what looked like spells that the Prince had made
up himself.
“Or herself,” said Hermione irritably, overhearing Harry pointing some of
these out to Ron in the common room on Saturday evening. “It might have
been a girl. I think the handwriting looks more like a girl’s than a boy’s.”“The Half-Blood 
Prince,
 he was called,” Harry said. “How many girls have
been Princes?”
Hermione seemed to have no answer to this. She merely scowled and
twitc rewolves deserve blood, that we ought to
revenge ourselves on normal people.”
“But you are normal!” said Harry fiercely. “You’ve just got a — a problem
—”
Lupin burst out laughing. “Sometimes you remind me a lot of James. He
called it my ‘furry little problem’ in company. Many people were under the
impression that I owned a badly behaved rabbit.”
He accepted a glass of eggnog from Mr. Weasley with a word of thanks,
looking slightly more cheerful. Harry, meanwhile, felt a rush of excitement:
This last mention of his father had reminded him that there was something he
had been looking forward to asking Lupin.
“Have you ever heard of someone called the Half-Blood Prince?”
“The Half-Blood what?”
“Prince,” said Harry, watching him closely for signs of recognition.
“There are no Wizarding princes,” said Lupin, now smiling. “Is this a title
you’re thinking of adopting? I should have thought being ‘the Chosen One’
would be enough.”
“It’s nothing to do with me!” said Harry indignantly. “The Half-Blood
Prince is someon"

sound of the voice wound Harry’s fear to an even higher pitch.
“What is this? What’s happened, Cissy?”
Bellatrix Lestrange walked slowly around the prisoners, and stopped on
Harry’s right, staring at Hermione through her heavily lidded eyes.
“But surely,” she said quietly, “this is the Mudblood girl? This is Granger?”
“Yes, yes, it’s Granger!” cried Lucius. “And beside her, we think, Potter!
Potter and his friends, caught at last!”
“Potter?” shrieked Bellatrix, and she backed away, the better to take in
Harry. “Are you sure? Well then, the Dark Lord must be informed at once!”
She dragged back her left sleeve: Harry saw the Dark Mark burned into the
flesh of her arm, and knew that she was about to touch it, to summon her
beloved master —
“I was about to call him!” said Lucius, and his hand actually closed upon
Bellatrix’s wrist, preventing her from touching the Mark. “
I 
shall summon
him, Bella, Potter has been brought to my house, and it is therefore upon my

Slytherin; I am sure that Voldemort considered it of stupendous importance.”
“So, the other Horcruxes?” said Harry. “Do you think you know what they
are, sir?”
“I can only guess,” said Dumbledore. “For the reasons I have alreadygiven, I believe that Lord Voldemort would prefer objects that, in themselves,
have a certain grandeur. I have therefore trawled back through Voldemort’s
past to see if I can find evidence that such artifacts have disappeared around
him.”
“The locket!” said Harry loudly. “Hufflepuff’s cup!”
“Yes,” said Dumbledore, smiling, “I would be prepared to bet — perhaps
not my other hand — but a couple of fingers, that they became Horcruxes
three and four. The remaining two, assuming again that he created a total of
six, are more of a problem, but I will hazard a guess that, having secured
objects from Hufflepuff and Slytherin, he set out to track down objects owned

lake with the first years; Professor McGonagall was presumably supervisingthe drying of the entrance hall floor, but there was another empty chair too,
and Harry couldn’t think who else was missing.
“Where’s the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher?” said Hermione,
who was also looking up at the teachers.
They had never yet had a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher who had
lasted more than three terms. Harry’s favorite by far had been Professor
Lupin, who had resigned last year. He looked up and down the staff table.
There was definitely no new face there.
“Maybe they couldn’t get anyone!” said Hermione, looking anxious.
Harry scanned the table more carefully. Tiny little Professor Flitwick, the
Charms teacher, was sitting on a large pile of cushions beside Professor
Sprout, the Herbology teacher, whose hat was askew over her flyaway gray
hair. She was talking to Professor Sinistra of the Astronomy department. On
Professor Sinistra’s other side was the sallow-faced ter the Defense Against the Dark Arts job again, sir? He didn’t

persuade Slughorn to hand over the true memory, but nothing in the
nature of a brain wave occurred and he was reduced to doing what he did
increasingly these days when at a loss: poring over his Potions book, hoping
that the Prince would have scribbled something useful in a margin, as he had
done so many times before.
“You won’t find anything in there,” said Hermione firmly, late on Sunday
evening.
“Don’t start, Hermione,” said Harry. “If it hadn’t been for the Prince, Ron
wouldn’t be sitting here now.”
“He would if you’d just listened to Snape in our fir into Dumbledore’s face. “Why did

He put Hagrid’s flute to his lips and blew. It wasn’t really a tune, but from
the first note the beast’s eyes began to droop. Harry hardly drew breath.
Slowly, the dog’s growls ceased — it tottered on its paws and fell to its knees,
then it slumped to the ground, fast asleep.
“Keep playing,” Ron warned Harry as they slipped out of the Cloak and
crept toward the trapdoor. They could feel the dog’s hot, smelly breath as they
approached the giant heads.
“I think we’ll be able to pull the door open,” said Ron, peering over the
dog’s back. “Want to go first, Hermione?”

HALLOWEEN
alfoy couldn’t believe his eyes when he saw that Harry and Ron were
still at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful.
Indeed, by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the three-
headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were quite keen to have
another one. In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the package that
seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot
of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection.
“It’s either really valuable or really dangerous,” said Ron.
“Or both,” said Harry.
But as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was
about two inches long, they didn’t have much chance of guessing what it was
without further clues.
Neither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay
underneath the dog and the trapdoor. All Neville cared about was never going
near the dog again.
Hermione was now refusing to spea ok — read that, there.”
She pushed the book toward them, and Harry and Ron read:
The ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the
Sorcerer’s Stone, a legendary substance with astonishing powers.
The Stone will transform any metal into pure gold. It also produces
the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal.
There have been many reports of the Sorcerer’s Stone over the
centuries, but the only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr.
Nicolas Flamel, the noted alchemist and opera lover. Mr. Flamel,
who celebrated his six hundred and sixty-fifth birthday last year,
enjoys a quiet life in Devon with his wife, Perenelle (six hundred
and fifty-eight).
“See?” said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had finished. “The dog must be
guarding Flamel’s Sorcerer’s Stone! I bet he asked Dumbledore to keep it safe
for him, because they’re friends and he knew someone was after it, that’s why
he wanted the Stone moved out of Gringotts!”
“A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying!” said Harry. “No

What creature is Aragog?,Acromantula,Aragog is a giant spider.,"pes shifted all around him.
“The thing that lives in the castle,” said Aragog, “is an ancient creature we
spiders fear above all others. Well do I remember how I pleaded with Hagrid
to let me go, when I sensed the beast moving about the school.”
“What is it?” said Harry urgently.
More loud clicking, more rustling; the spiders seemed to be closing in.
“We do not speak of it!” said Aragog fiercely. “We do not name it! I never
even told Hagrid the name of that dread creature, though he asked me, many
times.”
Harry didn’t want to press the subject, not with the spiders pressing closer
on all sides. Aragog seemed to be tired of talking. He was backing slowly into
his domed web, but his fellow spiders continued to inch slowly toward Harry
and Ron.
“We’ll just go, then,” Harry called desperately to Aragog, hearing leaves
rustling behind him.
“Go?” said Aragog slowly. “I think not. . . .”
“But — but —”
“My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid, on my command. But I
cannot deny them fresh meat, when it wanders so will t me coming down here, Hagrid.”
“Not in trouble, are yeh?” said Hagrid, looking up, alarmed. “Yeh shouldn’
be outta the castle in the evenin’, I know it, it’s my fault —”
“No, no, when he heard what I was doing he said he’d like to come and pay
his last respects to Aragog too,” said Harry. “He’s gone to change into
something more suitable, I think . . . and he said he’d bring some bottles so
we can drink to Aragog’s memory. . . .”
“Did he?” said Hagrid, looking both astonished and touched. “Tha’s —
tha’s righ’ nice of him, that is, an’ not turnin’ yeh in either. I’ve never really
had a lot ter do with Horace Slughorn before. . . . Comin’ ter see old Aragog
off, though, eh? Well . . . he’d’ve liked that, Aragog would. . . .”
Harry thought privately that what Aragog would have liked most about
Slughorn was the ample amount of edible flesh he provided, but he merely
moved to the rear window of Hagrid’s hut, where he saw the rather horrible
sight of the enormous dead spider lying on its back outside, its legs cur  been my instinct, but out of
respect for Hagrid, I never harmed a human. The body of the girl who was
killed was discovered in a bathroom. I never saw any part of the castle but the
cupboard in which I grew up. Our kind like the dark and the quiet. . . .”
“But then . . . Do you know what 
did
 kill that girl?” said Harry. “Because
whatever it is, it’s back and attacking people again —”
His words were drowned by a loud outbreak of clicking and the rustling of
many long legs shifting angrily; large black shapes shifted all around him.
“The thing that lives in the castle,” said Aragog, “is an ancient creature we
spiders fear above all others. Well do I remember how I pleaded with Hagrid
to let me go, when I sensed the beast moving about the school.”
“What is it?” said Harry urgently.
More loud clicking, more rustling; the spiders seemed to be closing in.
“We do not speak of it!” said Aragog fiercely. “We do not name it! I never
even told Hagrid the name of that dread creature, though he asked me, many
times.”

Who does Harry marry?,Ginny Weasley,"According to the Harry Potter books, Harry marries Ginny Weasley."," her eldest son; she began to sob, tears falling onto Bill’s mutilated
face.
“Of course, it doesn’t matter how he looks. . . . It’s not r-really
important . . . but he was a very handsome little b-boy . . . always very
handsome . . . and he was g-going to be married!”
“And what do you mean by zat?” said Fleur suddenly and loudly. “What do
you mean, ‘’e was 
going
 to be married?’”
Mrs. Weasley raised her tear-stained face, looking startled. “Well — only
that —”
“You theenk Bill will not wish to marry me anymore?” demanded Fleur.
“You theenk, because of these bites, he will not love me?”“No, that’s not what I —”
“Because ’e will!” said Fleur, drawing herself up to her full height and
throwing back her long mane of silver hair. “It would take more zan a
werewolf to stop Bill loving me!”
“Well, yes, I’m sure,” said Mrs. Weasley, “but I thought perhaps — given
how — how he —”
“You thought I would not weesh to marry him? Or per’aps, you hoped?”
said Fleur, her nostrils flaring. “What do I care how he looks? I am g at he really is going to marry
her,” sighed Ginny later that evening, as she, Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat
beside the open window of the Gryffindor common room, looking out over
the twilit grounds.
“She’s not that bad,” said Harry. “Ugly, though,” he added hastily, as Ginny
raised her eyebrows, and she let out a reluctant giggle.
“Well, I suppose if Mum can stand it, I can.”
“Anyone else we know died?” Ron asked Hermione, who was perusing the
Evening Prophet.
Hermione winced at the forced toughness in his voice. “No,” she said
reprovingly, folding up the newspaper. “They’re still looking for Snape but no
sign . . .”
“Of course there isn’t,” said Harry, who became angry every time this
subject cropped up. “They won’t find Snape till they find Voldemort, and
seeing as they’ve never managed to do that in all this time . . .”“I’m going to go to bed,” yawned Ginny. “I haven’t been sleeping that well
since . . . well . . . I could do with some sleep.”
She kissed Harry (Ron looked away pointedly), waved at the other Probably to show the Poisoning Department at St. Mungo’s,” said Ron
under his breath.
Harry waited until they could hear Xenophilius moving about in the kitchen
downstairs before speaking.
“What do you think?” he asked Hermione.
“Oh, Harry,” she said wearily, “it’s a pile of utter rubbish. This can’t be
what the sign really means. This must just be his weird take on it. What a
waste of time.”
“I s’pose this 
is
 the man who brought us Crumple-Horned Snorkacks,” said
Ron.
“You don’t believe it either?” Harry asked him.
“Nah, that story’s just one of those things you tell kids to teach them
lessons, isn’t it? ‘Don’t go looking for trouble, don’t pick fights, don’t go
messing around with stuff that’s best left alone! Just keep your head down,
mind your own business, and you’ll be okay.’ Come to think of it,” Ron
added, “maybe that story’s why elder wands are supposed to be unlucky.”“What are you talking about?”
“One of those superstitions, isn’t it? ‘May-born witches will marry
Muggles.’ ‘Jinx by twilight, undon"
What are the names of Harry's children?,"James, Albus, and Lily","I do not know the names of Harry's children, as this passage does not mention them. The story has not yet reached the point where Harry has children."," “I saw the Death Eaters! I cangive you their names! Lucius Malfoy —”
Snape made a sudden movement, but as Harry looked at him, Snape’s eyes
flew back to Fudge.
“Malfoy was cleared!” said Fudge, visibly affronted. “A very old family —
donations to excellent causes —”
“Macnair!” Harry continued.
“Also cleared! Now working for the Ministry!”
“Avery — Nott — Crabbe — Goyle —”
“You are merely repeating the names of those who were acquitted of being
Death Eaters thirteen years ago!” said Fudge angrily. “You could have found
those names in old reports of the trials! For heaven’s sake, Dumbledore — the
boy was full of some crackpot story at the end of last year too — his tales are
getting taller, and you’re still swallowing them — the boy can talk to snakes,
Dumbledore, and you still think he’s trustworthy?”
“You fool!” Professor McGonagall cried. “Cedric Diggory! Mr. Crouch!
These deaths were not the random work of a lunatic!”
“I see no evidence to the contrary!” shouted Fudge, now matching her
anger, his face purp owever, it was in his usual curt voice.
“We must follow the rules, and the rules state clearly that those people
whose names come out of the Goblet of Fire are bound to compete in the
tournament.”
“Well, Barty knows the rule book back to front,” said Bagman, beaming
and turning back to Karkaroff and Madame Maxime, as though the matter
was now closed.
“I insist upon resubmitting the names of the rest of my students,” saidKarkaroff. He had dropped his unctuous tone and his smile now. His face
wore a very ugly look indeed. “You will set up the Goblet of Fire once more,
and we will continue adding names until each school has two champions. It’s
only fair, Dumbledore.”
“But Karkaroff, it doesn’t work like that,” said Bagman. “The Goblet of
Fire’s just gone out — it won’t reignite until the start of the next tournament
—”
“— in which Durmstrang will most certainly not be competing!” exploded
Karkaroff. “After all our meetings and negotiations and compromises, I little
expected something of this nature to occur! I h -
Be-Named operated always in the greatest secrecy. . . . He preferred that we
— I mean to say, his supporters — and I regret now, very deeply, that I ever
counted myself among them —”
“Get on with it,” sneered Moody.
“— we never knew the names of every one of our fellows — He alone
knew exactly who we all were —”
“Which was a wise move, wasn’t it, as it prevented someone like you,
Karkaroff, from turning all of them in,” muttered Moody.
“Yet you say you have 
some
 names for us?” said Mr. Crouch.
“I — I do,” said Karkaroff breathlessly. “And these were important
supporters, mark you. People I saw with my own eyes doing his bidding. I
give this information as a sign that I fully and totally renounce him, and am
filled with a remorse so deep I can barely —”
“These names are?” said Mr. Crouch sharply.
Karkaroff drew a deep breath.
“There was Antonin Dolohov,” he said. “I — I saw him torture countless
Muggles and — and non-supporters of the Dark Lord.”
“And helped him do it,” murmured Moody.
“We have already app"
What is the name of the wand shop in Diagon Alley?,Ollivanders,The wand shop in Diagon Alley is Ollivander's.,"t Harry
could see through the dusty shop window was definitely not Diagon Alley.
The sooner he got out of here, the better. Nose still stinging where it had hit
the hearth, Harry made his way swiftly and silently toward the door, but
before he’d got halfway toward it, two people appeared on the other side of
the glass — and one of them was the very last person Harry wanted to meet
when he was lost, covered in soot, and wearing broken glasses: Draco Malfoy.
Harry looked quickly around and spotted a large black cabinet to his left;
he shot inside it and pulled the doors closed, leaving a small crack to peer
through. Seconds later, a bell clanged, and Malfoy stepped into the shop.
The man who followed could only be Draco’s father. He had the same pale,
pointed face and identical cold, gray eyes. Mr. Malfoy crossed the shop,
looking lazily at the items on display, and rang a bell on the counter before
turning to his son and saying, “Touch nothing, Draco.”
Malfoy, who had reached for the glass eye, said, “I though . He was a good man,
Florean.”
“Talking of Diagon Alley,” said Mr. Weasley, “looks like Ollivander’s gone
too.”
“The wandmaker?” said Ginny, looking startled.
“That’s the one. Shop’s empty. No sign of a struggle. No one knows
whether he left voluntarily or was kidnapped.”
“But wands — what’ll people do for wands?”
“They’ll make do with other makers,” said Lupin. “But Ollivander was the
best, and if the other side have got him it’s not so good for us.”
The day after this rather gloomy birthday tea, their letters and booklists
arrived from Hogwarts. Harry’s included a surprise: He had been made
Quidditch Captain.
“That gives you equal status with prefects!” cried Hermione happily. “You
can use our special bathroom now and everything!”
“Wow, I remember when Charlie wore one of these,” said Ron, examining
the badge with glee. “Harry, this is so cool, you’re my Captain — if you let
me back on the team, I suppose, ha ha. . . .”“Well, I don’t suppose we can put off a trip to Diagon Alley much longer

something diff —”
“Did you hear about Florean Fortescue, Remus?” asked Bill, who was
being plied with wine by Fleur. “The man who ran —”
“— the ice-cream place in Diagon Alley?” Harry interrupted, with an
unpleasant, hollow sensation in the pit of his stomach. “He used to give me
free ice creams. What’s happened to him?”
“Dragged off, by the look of his place.”
“Why?” asked Ron, while Mrs. Weasley pointedly glared at Bill.
“Who knows? He must’ve upset them somehow. He was a good man,
Florean.”
“Talking of Diagon Alley,” said Mr. Weasley, “looks like Ollivander’s gone
too.”
“The wandmaker?” said Ginny, looking startled.
“That’s the one. Shop’s empty. No sign of a struggle. No one knows
whether he left voluntarily or was kidnapped.”
“But wands — what’ll people do for wands?”
“They’ll make do with other makers,” said Lupin. “But Ollivander was the

Who is the head of Slytherin House?,Severus Snape,The head of Slytherin House is Salazar Slytherin.,"had tried to put me in Slytherin, I’d’ve got the
train straight back home. . . .”
Hermione nodded fervently, but Harry didn’t say anything. His stomach
had just dropped unpleasantly.
Harry had never told Ron and Hermione that the Sorting Hat had seriously
considered putting 
him
 in Slytherin. He could remember, as though it were
yesterday, the small voice that had spoken in his ear when he’d placed the hat
on his head a year before: 
You could be great, you know, it’s all here in your
head, and Slytherin would help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about
that. . . .
But Harry, who had already heard of Slytherin House’s reputation forturning out Dark wizards, had thought desperately, 
Not Slytherin!
 and the hat
had said, 
Oh, well, if you’re sure . . . better be Gryffindor. . . .
As they were shunted along in the throng, Colin Creevey went past.
“Hiya, Harry!”
“Hullo, Colin,” said Harry automatically.
“Harry — Harry — a boy in my class has been saying you’re —”
But Colin was so small he couldn’t fight ag  you are here, your House will be something like
your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your
House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free time in your House

“The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and
Slytherin. Each House has its own noble history and each has produced
outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs
will earn your House points, while any rule-breaking will lose House points.
At the end of the year, the House with the most points is awarded the House
Cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever House
becomes yours.
“The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest
of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can
while you are waiting.”
Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville’s cloak, which was fastened
under his left ear, and on Ron’s smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to
flatten his hair.
“I shall return when we are r aw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall
full of people craning to get a good look at him. Next second he was looking
at the black inside of the hat. He waited.
“Hmm,” said a small voice in his ear. “Difficult. Very difficult. Plenty of
courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There’s talent, oh my goodness, yes —
and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that’s interesting. . . . So where shall I
put you?”
Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, 
Not Slytherin, not
Slytherin.
“Not Slytherin, eh?” said the small voice. “Are you sure? You could be
great, you know, it’s all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the
way to greatness, no doubt about that — no? Well, if you’re sure — better be
GRYFFINDOR!”
Harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall. He took off the
hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table. He was so relieved to
have been chosen and not put in Slytherin, he hardly noticed that he was
getting the loudest cheer yet. Percy the Prefect got up and "

“Or someone who looked like a girl or a woman,” said Harry. “Don’t
forget, there was a cauldron full of Polyjuice Potion at Hogwarts. We know
some of it got stolen. . . .”
In his mind’s eye, he watched a parade of Crabbes and Goyles prance past,
all transformed into girls.
“I think I’m going to take another swig of Felix,” said Harry, “and have a
go at the Room of Requirement again.”“That would be a complete waste of potion,” said Hermione flatly, putting
down the copy of 
Spellman’s Syllabary
 she had just taken out of her bag.
“Luck can only get you so far, Harry. The situation with Slughorn was
different; you always had the ability to persuade him, you just needed to
tweak the circumstances a bit. Luck isn’t enough to get you through a
powerful enchantment, though. Don’t go wasting the rest of that potion!
You’ll need all the luck you can get if Dumbledore takes you along with him
. . .” She dropped her voice to a whisper.
“Couldn’t we make some more?” Ron asked Harry, ignoring Hermione.
“It’d be gre d just taken out of her bag.

“It’d be great to have a stock of it. . . . Have a look in the book . . .”
Harry pulled his copy of 
Advanced Potion-Making
 out of his bag and
looked up Felix Felicis.
“Blimey, it’s seriously complicated,” he said, running an eye down the list
of ingredients. “And it takes six months . . . You’ve got to let it stew. . . .”
“Typical,” said Ron.
Harry was about to put his book away again when he noticed the corner of
a page folded down; turning to it, he saw the

“For Enemies,” that he had  The potion
within was splashing about merrily; it was the color of molten gold, and large
drops were leaping like goldfish above the surface, though not a particle had
spilled.
“Oho,” said Slughorn again. Harry was sure that Slughorn had not
forgotten the potion at all, but had waited to be asked for dramatic effect.
“Yes. That. Well, 
that
 one, ladies and gentlemen, is a most curious little
potion called Felix Felicis. I take it,” he turned, smiling, to look at Hermione,
who had let out an audible gasp, “that you know what Felix Felicis does, Miss
Granger?”
“It’s liquid luck,” said Hermione excitedly. “It makes you lucky!”
The whole class seemed to sit up a little straighter. Now all Harry could see
of Malfoy was the back of his sleek blond head, because he was at last giving
Slughorn his full and undivided attention.
“Quite right, take another ten points for Gryffindor. Yes, it’s a funny little
potion, Felix Felicis,” said Slughorn. “Desperately tricky to make, and
disastrous to get wrong. However, if bre"

“Yeah . . . I — er . . . thanks,” said Harry weakly.
“What is this thing?” said Moody, drawing the Marauder’s Map out of his
pocket and unfolding it.
“Map of Hogwarts,” said Harry, hoping Moody was going to pull him out
of the staircase soon; his leg was really hurting him.
“Merlin’s beard,” Moody whispered, staring at the map, his magical eye
going haywire. “This . . . this is some map, Potter!”
“Yeah, it’s . . . quite useful,” Harry said. His eyes were starting to water
from the pain. “Er — Professor Moody, d’you think you could help me — ?”
“What? Oh! Yes . . . yes, of course . . .”
Moody took hold of Harry’s arms and pulled; Harry’s leg came free of the
trick step, and he climbed onto the one above it. Moody was still gazing at the
map.
“Potter . . .” he said slowly, “you didn’t happen, by any chance, to see who
broke into Snape’s office, did you? On this map, I mean?”
“Er . . . yeah, I did . . .” Harry admitted. “It was Mr. Crouch.”
Moody’s magical eye whizzed over the entire surface of the map. He

out the Marauder’s Map too. “I am no longer your teacher, so I don’t feel
guilty about giving you this back as well. It’s no use to me, and I daresay you,
Ron, and Hermione will find uses for it.”
Harry took the map and grinned.
“You told me Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs would’ve wanted to
lure me out of school . . . you said they’d have thought it was funny.”
“And so we would have,” said Lupin, now reaching down to close his case.
“I have no hesitation in saying that James would have been highly
disappointed if his son had never found any of the secret passages out of the
castle.”
There was a knock on the door. Harry hastily stuffed the Marauder’s Map
and the Invisibility Cloak into his pocket.
It was Professor Dumbledore. He didn’t look surprised to see Harry there.
“Your carriage is at the gates, Remus,” he said.
“Thank you, Headmaster.”
Lupin picked up his old suitcase and the empty grindylow tank.
“Well — good-bye, Harry,” he said, smiling. “It has been a real pleasure
teaching you. I feel sur n helping him,” he said, with a furious glance at Black,
“how did you know he was here?”
“The map,” said Lupin. “The Marauder’s Map. I was in my office
examining it —”
“You know how to work it?” Harry said suspiciously.
“Of course I know how to work it,” said Lupin, waving his hand
impatiently. “I helped write it. I’m Moony — that was my friends’ nickname
for me at school.”
“You 
wrote — 
?”
“The important thing is, I was watching it carefully this evening, because I
had an idea that you, Ron, and Hermione might try and sneak out of the castle
to visit Hagrid before his hippogriff was executed. And I was right, wasn’t I?”
He had started to pace up and down, looking at them. Little patches of dust
rose at his feet.
“You might have been wearing your father’s old Cloak, Harry —”“How d’you know about the Cloak?”

And the Goblet of Fire turned red once more; sparks showered out of it; the
tongue of flame shot high into the air, and from its tip Dumbledore pulled the
third piece of parchment.
“The Hogwarts champion,” he called, “is Cedric Diggory!”
“No!” said Ron loudly, but nobody heard him except Harry; the uproar
from the next table was too great. Every single Hufflepuff had jumped to his
or her feet, screaming and stamping, as Cedric made his way past them,
grinning broadly, and headed off toward the chamber behind the teachers’
table. Indeed, the applause for Cedric went on so long that it was some time
before Dumbledore could make himself heard again.
“Excellent!” Dumbledore called happily as at last the tumult died down.
“Well, we now have our three champions. I am sure I can count upon all of
you, including the remaining students from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang, to
give your champions every ounce of support you can muster. By cheering
your champion on, you wil ds of years ago.
“There have been several attempts over the centuries to reinstate the
tournament,” Dumbledore continued, “none of which has been very
successful. However, our own Departments of International Magical
Cooperation and Magical Games and Sports have decided the time is ripe for
another attempt. We have worked hard over the summer to ensure that this
time, no champion will find himself or herself in mortal danger.
“The Heads of Beauxbatons and Durmstrang will be arriving with their
shortlisted contenders in October, and the selection of the three champions
will take place at Halloween. An impartial judge will decide which students
are most worthy to compete for the Triwizard Cup, the glory of their school,
and a thousand Galleons personal prize money.”
“I’m going for it!” Fred Weasley hissed down the table, his face lit with
enthusiasm at the prospect of such glory and riches. He was not the only
person who seemed to be visualizing himself as the Hogwarts champion. At
every House table, Harry coul oke. Nearly everyone laughed, and Dumbledore chuckled appreciatively.
“I am 
not
 joking, Mr. Weasley,” he said, “though now that you mention it, I
did hear an excellent one over the summer about a troll, a hag, and a
leprechaun who all go into a bar . . .”
Professor McGonagall cleared her throat loudly.

ago as a friendly competition between the three largest European schools of

There was an odd red gleam in his hungry eyes now.
“Why do you care how I escaped?” said Harry slowly. “Voldemort was
after your time. . . .”
“Voldemort,” said Riddle softly, “is my past, present, and future, Harry
Potter. . . .”
He pulled Harry’s wand from his pocket and began to trace it through the
air, writing three shimmering words:
TOM MARVOLO RIDDLE
Then he waved the wand once, and the letters of his name rearranged
themselves:

“You see?” he whispered. “It was a name I was already using at Hogwarts,
to my most intimate friends only, of course. You think I was going to use my
filthy Muggle father’s name forever? I, in whose veins runs the blood of
Salazar Slytherin himself, through my mother’s side? I, keep the name of a

still shaking.

“Stop saying the name!” said Ron in a terrified whisper, as if he thought
Voldemort could hear them.
Harry wasn’t listening.

stars as well.”
“Will you stop saying the name!”
 Ron hissed.
“So all I’ve got to wait for now is Snape to steal the Stone,” Harry went on
feverishly, “then Voldemort will be able to come and finish me off. . . . Well, I
suppose Bane’ll be happy.”
Hermione looked very frightened, but she had a word of comfort.
“Harry, everyone sa rs of his name rearranged
themselves:
I AM LORD VOLDEMORT
“You see?” he whispered. “It was a name I was already using at Hogwarts,
to my most intimate friends only, of course. You think I was going to use my
filthy Muggle father’s name forever? I, in whose veins runs the blood of
Salazar Slytherin himself, through my mother’s side? I, keep the name of a
foul, common Muggle, who abandoned me even before I was born, just
because he found out his wife was a witch? No, Harry — I fashioned myself a
new name, a name I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak,when I had become the greatest sorcerer in the world!”
Harry’s brain seemed to have jammed. He stared numbly at Riddle, at the
orphaned boy who had grown up to murder Harry’s own parents, and so many
others. . . . At last he forced himself to speak.
“You’re not,” he said, his quiet voice full of hatred.
“Not what?” snapped Riddle.
“Not the greatest sorcerer in the world,” said Harry, breathing fast. “Sorry
to disappoint you and all that, but the grea"

The exact spell is not specified.","s broken at last by Mrs. Weasley.
“Where’s Hedwig, Harry?” she said coaxingly. “We can put her up with
Pigwidgeon and give her something to eat.”
His insides clenched like a fist. He could not tell her the truth. He drank the
last of his firewhisky to avoid answering.
“Wait till it gets out yeh did it again, Harry,” said Hagrid. “Escaped him,
fought him off when he was right on top of yeh!”
“It wasn’t me,” said Harry flatly. “It was my wand. My wand acted of its
own accord.”
After a few moments, Hermione said gently, “But that’s impossible, Harry.
You mean that you did magic without meaning to; you reacted instinctively.”
“No,” said Harry. “The bike was falling, I couldn’t have told you where
Voldemort was, but my wand spun in my hand and found him and shot a spell
at him, and it wasn’t even a spell I recognized. I’ve never made gold flames
appear before.”

they’re trai id gently, “But that’s impossible, Harry.

“It wasn’t like that,” said Harry through gritted teeth. His scar was burning:
He felt angry and frustrated; he hated the idea that they were all imagining
him to have power to match Voldemort’s.
No one said anything. He knew that they did not believe him. Now that he
came to think of it, he had never heard of a wand performing magic on its
own before.His scar seared with pain; it was all he could do not to moan aloud.
Muttering about fresh air, he set down his glass and left the room.
As he crossed  lt a creeping chill behind him that could mean only
one thing. There was more than one.
“DUDLEY, KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT! WHATEVER YOU DO,
KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT! Wand!” Harry muttered frantically, his hands
flying over the ground like spiders. “Where’s — wand — come on —
Lumos!
”
He said the spell automatically, desperate for light to help him in his search
— and to his disbelieving relief, light flared inches from his right hand — the
wand-tip had ignited. Harry snatched it up, scrambled to his feet, and turned
around.
His stomach turned over.
A towering, hooded figure was gliding smoothly toward him, hovering over
the ground, no feet or face visible beneath its robes, sucking on the night as it
came.Stumbling backward, Harry raised his wand.
“Expecto Patronum!”
A silvery wisp of vapor shot from the tip of the wand and the dementor
slowed, but the spell hadn’t worked properly; tripping over his feet, Harry
retreated farther as the dementor bore down upon him, panic fogging his brain

of the corridor, as silence fell among the mass of students pressing forward to
see the grisly sight.
Then someone shouted through the quiet.
“Enemies of the Heir, beware! You’ll be next, Mudbloods!”
It was Draco Malfoy. He had pushed to the front of the crowd, his cold eyes
alive, his usually bloodless face flushed, as he grinned at the sight of the
hanging, immobile cat.W

THE WRITING ON THE WALL
hat’s going on here? What’s going on?”
Attracted no doubt by Malfoy’s shout, Argus Filch came
shouldering his way through the crowd. Then he saw Mrs. Norris and fell
back, clutching his face in horror.
“My cat! My cat! What’s happened to Mrs. Norris?” he shrieked.
And his popping eyes fell on Harry.
“You!”
 he screeched. “
You!
 You’ve murdered my cat! You’ve killed her!
I’ll kill you! I’ll —”
“Argus!”
Dumbledore had arrived on the scene, followed by a number of other
teachers. In seconds, he had swept past Harry, Ron, ssaging his head.
“What 
was
 that?”
“It was either a very big cat or quite a small tiger,” said Harry.
“Where’s Hermione?”
“Probably getting her owl —”
They made their way back up the crowded street to the Magical Menagerie.
As they reached it, Hermione came out, but she wasn’t carrying an owl. Her
arms were clamped tightly around the enormous ginger cat.
“You 
bought
 that monster?” said Ron, his mouth hanging open.
“He’s 
gorgeous,
 isn’t he?” said Hermione, glowing.
That was a matter of opinion, thought Harry. The cat’s ginger fur was thick
and fluffy, but it was definitely a bit bowlegged and its face looked grumpy
and oddly squashed, as though it had run headlong into a brick wall. Now that
Scabbers was out of sight, however, the cat was purring contentedly in
Hermione’s arms.
“Hermione, that thing nearly scalped me!” said Ron.
“He didn’t mean to, did you, Crookshanks?” said Hermione.
“And what about Scabbers?” said Ron, pointing at the lump in his chest
pocket. “He needs rest and relaxation! How’s he g  the house. He got into his car and
backed out of number four’s drive.
It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something
peculiar — a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn’t realize what
he had seen — then he jerked his head around to look again. There was a
tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn’t a map in
sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the
light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley
drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It
was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive — no, 
looking
 at the sign;
cats couldn’t read maps 
or
 signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and
put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing
except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.
But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something
else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic "
What magical plant does Harry use to breathe underwater in the Triwizard Tournament?,Gillyweed,"According to the passage, Harry uses a magical plant called Devil's Snare to breathe underwater in the Triwizard Tournament."," stopped. There was a loud bark from the dog, but
Hermione had already jumped. She landed on Harry’s other side.
“We must be miles under the school,” she said.
“Lucky this plant thing’s here, really,” said Ron.
“Lucky!”
 shrieked Hermione. “Look at you both!”
She leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. She had to struggle
because the moment she had landed, the plant had started to twist snakelike
tendrils around her ankles. As for Harry and Ron, their legs had already been
bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing.
Hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on
her. Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off
them, but the more they strained against it, the tighter and faster the plant
wound around them.
“Stop moving!” Hermione ordered them. “I know what this is — it’s
Devil’s Snare!”
“Oh, I’m so glad we know what it’s called, that’s a great help,” snarled
Ron, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck.
“Shut up, I’m without their noticing.

“Well, hurry up, I can’t breathe!” Harry gasped, wrestling with it as it
curled around his chest.
“Devil’s Snare, Devil’s Snare . . . what did Professor Sprout say? — it likes
the dark and the damp —”
“So light a fire!” Harry choked.
“Yes — of course — but there’s no wood!” Hermione cried, wringing her
hands.
“HAVE YOU GONE MAD?” Ron bellowed. “ARE YOU A WITCH OR
NOT?”“Oh, right!” said Hermione, and she whipped out her wand, waved it,
muttered something, a oke. Nearly everyone laughed, and Dumbledore chuckled appreciatively.
“I am 
not
 joking, Mr. Weasley,” he said, “though now that you mention it, I
did hear an excellent one over the summer about a troll, a hag, and a
leprechaun who all go into a bar . . .”
Professor McGonagall cleared her throat loudly.

“The Triwizard Tournament was first established some seven hundred years
ago as a friendly competition between the three largest European schools of
wizardry: Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, and Durmstrang. A champion was selected
to represent each school, and the three champions competed in three magical
tasks. The schools took it in turns to host the tournament once every five

Who killed Dumbledore?,Severus Snape,"According to the passage, Dumbledore was killed by Snape.","ed his throat; it was dry from panic and the smoke.
“Hagrid, he killed . . .”
“Killed?” said Hagrid loudly, staring down at Harry. “Snape killed?
What’re yeh on abou’, Harry?”
“Dumbledore,” said Harry. “Snape killed . . . Dumbledore.”
Hagrid simply looked at him, the little of his face that could be seen
completely blank, uncomprehending.
“Dumbledore wha’, Harry?”
“He’s dead. Snape killed him. . . .”
“Don’ say that,” said Hagrid roughly. “Snape kill Dumbledore — don’ be
stupid, Harry. Wha’s made yeh say tha’?”
“I saw it happen.”
“Yeh couldn’ have.”
“I saw it, Hagrid.”
Hagrid shook his head; his expression was disbelieving but sympathetic,
and Harry knew that Hagrid thought he had sustained a blow to the head, that
he was confused, perhaps by the aftereffects of a jinx. . . .
“What musta happened was, Dumbledore musta told Snape ter go with
them Death Eaters,” Hagrid said confidently. “I suppose he’s gotta keep his
cover. Look, let’s get yeh back up ter the school. Come on, Harry. . . .”
Harry did not attempt  n his stomach at the sound of the name. In the
silence and the stillness, horror rose inside him.
“Hagrid . . .”
“I was bindin’ up a couple o’ bowtruckle legs when I heard ’em comin’,”
said Hagrid sadly, still staring at his wrecked cabin. “They’ll’ve bin burnt ter
twigs, poor little things. . . .”
“Hagrid . . .”
“But what happened, Harry? I jus’ saw them Death Eaters runnin’ down
from the castle, but what the ruddy hell was Snape doin’ with ’em? Where’s
he gone — was he chasin’ them?”“He . . .” Harry cleared his throat; it was dry from panic and the smoke.
“Hagrid, he killed . . .”
“Killed?” said Hagrid loudly, staring down at Harry. “Snape killed?
What’re yeh on abou’, Harry?”
“Dumbledore,” said Harry. “Snape killed . . . Dumbledore.”
Hagrid simply looked at him, the little of his face that could be seen

“He’s dead. Snape killed him. . . .”
“Don’ say that,” said Hagrid roughly. “Snape kill Dumbledore — don’ be
stupid, Harry. Wha’s made yeh say tha is killed him! You is killed Master’s son!”
“He is simply Stunned, Winky,” said Dumbledore. “Step aside, please.
Severus, you have the potion?”
Snape handed Dumbledore a small glass bottle of completely clear liquid:
the Veritaserum with which he had threatened Harry in class. Dumbledore got
up, bent over the man on the floor, and pulled him into a sitting position
against the wall beneath the Foe-Glass, in which the reflections of
Dumbledore, Snape, and McGonagall were still glaring down upon them all.
Winky remained on her knees, trembling, her hands over her face.
Dumbledore forced the man’s mouth open and poured three drops inside it.
Then he pointed his wand at the man’s chest and said, 
“Rennervate.”
Crouch’s son opened his eyes. His face was slack, his gaze unfocused.
Dumbledore knelt before him, so that their faces were level.
“Can you hear me?” Dumbledore asked quietly.
The man’s eyelids flickered.
“Yes,” he muttered.
“I would like you to tell us,” said Dumbledore softly, “how you came to be
here. Ho"
What shape is Harry's scar?,A lightning bolt,"According to the book, Harry's scar is shaped like a lightning bolt."," heart was beating very fast now. . . . He was going to get
there this time. . . . When he reached number ninety-seven he turned left and
hurried along the aisle between two rows. . . .But there was a shape on the floor at the very end, a black shape moving
upon the floor like a wounded animal. . . . Harry’s stomach contracted with
fear . . . with excitement. . . .
A voice issued from his own mouth, a high, cold voice empty of any human
kindness, “Take it for me. . . . Lift it down, now. . . . I cannot touch it . . . but
you can . . .”
The black shape upon the floor shifted a little. Harry saw a long-fingered
white hand clutching a wand rise on the end of his own arm . . . heard the
high, cold voice say, 
“Crucio!”
The man on the floor let out a scream of pain, attempted to stand but fell
back, writhing. Harry was laughing. He raised his wand, the curse lifted, and
the figure groaned and became motionless.
“Lord Voldemort is waiting . . .”
Very slowly, his arms trembling, the man on the ground raised his
shou of minutes.
Dumbledore stopped pacing and looked at Harry.
“My apologies,” he said quietly. He sat back down at his desk.
“D’you — d’you know why my scar’s hurting me?”
Dumbledore looked very intently at Harry for a moment, and then said, “I
have a theory, no more than that. . . . It is my belief that your scar hurts both
when Lord Voldemort is near you, and when he is feeling a particularly strong
surge of hatred.”
“But . . . why?”
“Because you and he are connected by the curse that failed,” said
Dumbledore. “That is no ordinary scar.”
“So you think . . . that dream . . . did it really happen?”
“It is possible,” said Dumbledore. “I would say — probable. Harry — did
you see Voldemort?”
“No,” said Harry. “Just the back of his chair. But — there wouldn’t have
been anything to see, would there? I mean, he hasn’t got a body, has he?
But . . . but then how could he have held the wand?” Harry said slowly.
“How indeed?” muttered Dumbledore. “How indeed . . .”
Neither Dumbledore nor Harry spoke for a while. Dumbledor nsively.
“Boggarts like dark, enclosed spaces,” said Professor Lupin. “Wardrobes,
the gap beneath beds, the cupboards under sinks — I once met one that had
lodged itself in a grandfather clock. 
This
 one moved in yesterday afternoon,
and I asked the headmaster if the staff would leave it to give my third years
some practice.
“So, the first question we must ask ourselves is, what 
is
 a boggart?”
Hermione put up her hand.
“It’s a shape-shifter,” she said. “It can take the shape of whatever it thinks
will frighten us most.”
“Couldn’t have put it better myself,” said Professor Lupin, and Hermioneglowed. “So the boggart sitting in the darkness within has not yet assumed a
form. He does not yet know what will frighten the person on the other side of
the door. Nobody knows what a boggart looks like when he is alone, but when
I let him out, he will immediately become whatever each of us most fears.
“This means,” said Professor Lupin, choosing to ignore Neville’s small
sputter of terror, “that we have a huge advanta"

Moody swept the dead spider off the desk onto the floor.
“Not nice,” he said calmly. “Not pleasant. And there’s no countercurse.
There’s no blocking it. Only one known person has ever survived it, and he’s
sitting right in front of me.”
Harry felt his face redden as Moody’s eyes (both of them) looked into his
own. He could feel everyone else looking around at him too. Harry stared at
the blank blackboard as though fascinated by it, but not really seeing it at
all. . . .
So that was how his parents had died . . . exactly like that spider. Had they
been unblemished and unmarked too? Had they simply seen the flash of green
light and heard the rush of speeding death, before life was wiped from their
bodies?
Harry had been picturing his parents’ deaths over and over again for three
years now, ever since he’d found out they had been murdered, ever since he’d
found out what had happened that night: Wormtail had betrayed his parents’
whereabouts to Voldemort, who had come to find them at their cottage. How s had died . . . exactly like that spider. Had they

Voldemort had killed Harry’s father first. How James Potter had tried to hold
him off, while he shouted at his wife to take Harry and run . . . Voldemort had
advanced on Lily Potter, told her to move aside so that he could kill Harry . . .
how she had begged him to kill her instead, refused to stop shielding her
son . . . and so Voldemort had murdered her too, before turning his wand on
Harry. . . .
Harry knew these details because he had heard his parents’ voices when he
had fought the dementors last year ut with a
noise of contempt he turned on his heel, vaulted into bed, and pulled the
hangings shut with such violence that they were ripped from the bed and fell
in a dusty pile to the floor. Ron glared at Seamus, then looked at Dean and
Neville.
“Anyone else’s parents got a problem with Harry?” he said aggressively.
“My parents are Muggles, mate,” said Dean, shrugging. “They don’t know
nothing about no deaths at Hogwarts, because I’m not stupid enough to tell
them.”
“You don’t know my mother, she’ll weasel anything out of anyone!”
Seamus snapped at him. “Anyway, your parents don’t get the

What spell is used to unlock doors?,Alohomora,"According to the text, the spell used to unlock doors is not mentioned. However, it is mentioned that Harry is examining a spell called ""Levicorpus"" which seems to have caused the Prince some trouble."," a hex that caused toenails to grow alarmingly fast (he had
tried this on Crabbe in the corridor, with very entertaining results); a jinx that
glued the tongue to the roof of the mouth (which he had twice used, to general
applause, on an unsuspecting Argus Filch); and, perhaps most useful of all,
Muffliato,
 a spell that filled the ears of anyone nearby with an unidentifiable
buzzing, so that lengthy conversations could be held in class without being
overheard. The only person who did not find these charms amusing was
Hermione, who maintained a rigidly disapproving expression throughout and
refused to talk at all if Harry had used the 
Muffliato
 spell on anyone in the
vicinity.
Sitting up in bed, Harry turned the book sideways so as to examine more
closely the scribbled instructions for a spell that seemed to have caused the
Prince some trouble. There were many crossings-out and alterations, but
finally, crammed into a corner of the page, the scribble:

“Will you stop harping on about the book!” snapped Harry. “The Prince

know, he was making a note of something that had been used against him!”
“I don’t believe this,” said Hermione. “You’re actually defending —”
“I’m not defending what I did!” said Harry quickly. “I wish I hadn’t done
it, and not just because I’ve got about a dozen detentions. You know I
wouldn’t’ve used a spell like that, not even on Malfoy, but you can’t blame
the Prince, he hadn’t written ‘try this out, it’s really good’ — he was just

“Are you telling me,” said Hermione, “that you’re going to go back — ?”

anything was, because it all seemed to move around a lot. The people in the

could walk.The ghosts didn’t help, either. It was always a nasty shock when one of

Moody picked up the somersaulting spider and threw it back into the jar.
“Anyone else know one? Another illegal curse?”
Hermione’s hand flew into the air again and so, to Harry’s slight surprise,
did Neville’s. The only class in which Neville usually volunteered
information was Herbology, which was easily his best subject. Neville looked
surprised at his own daring.

“Stan Shunpike, a Death Eater?” said Harry, remembering the spotty youth
he had first met three years before. “No way!”
“He might have been put under the Imperius Curse,” said Ron reasonably.
“You never can tell.”
“It doesn’t look like it,” said Hermione, who was still reading. “It says here
he was arrested after he was overheard talking about the Death Eaters’ secret
plans in a pub.” She looked up with a troubled expression on her face. “If he
was under the Imperius Curse, he’d hardly stand around gossiping about their
plans, would he?”
“It sounds like he was trying to make out he knew more than he did,” said
Ron. “Isn’t he the one who claimed he was going to become Minister ofMagic when he was trying to chat up those veela?”
“Yeah, that’s him,” said Harry. “I dunno what they’re playing at, taking
Stan seriously.”

Hermione, frowning. “People are terrified — you know the Patil twins’

rose onto two of its hind legs and went into what was unmistakably a tap

Everyone was laughing — everyone except Moody.
“Think it’s funny, do you?” he growled. “You’d like it, would you, if I did
it to you?”
The laughter died away almost instantly.
“Total control,” said Moody quietly as the spider balled itself up and began
to roll over and over. “I could make it jump out of the window, drown itself,

“Nah, they make her look tame. The other teachers are all supposed to refer

Harry, Ron, and Hermione chose seats as far as possible from Percy in the
common room that night. Ron was still in a very bad temper and kept blotting
his Charms homework. When he reached absently for his wand to remove the
smudges, it ignited the parchment. Fuming almost as much as his homework,
Ron slammed

Hermione followed suit.
“Who can it be, though?” she said in a quiet voice, as though continuing a
conversation they had just been having. “Who’d

“What did you do with the dragon?”
“Released it into the wild,” said Ron. “Hermione was all for keeping it as a

“Don’t exaggerate, Ron —”
“But what have you been doing? People have been saying you’ve just been
on the run, Harry, but I don’t think so. I think you’ve been up to something.”
“You’re right,” said Harry, “but tell us about Hogwarts, Neville, we haven’theard anything.”
“It’s been . . . well, it’s not really like Hogwarts anymore,” said Neville, the
smile fading from his face as he spoke. “Do you know about the Carrows?”
“Those two Death Eaters who teach here?”
“They do more than teach,” said Neville. “They’re in charge of all
discipline. They like punishment, the Carrows.”
“Like Umbridge?”
“Nah, they make her look tame. The other teachers are all supposed to refer
us to the Carrows if we do anything wrong. They don’t, though, if they can
avoid it. You can tell they all hate them as much as we do.

“Yeah, that is weird,” said Harry, frowning. “I heard him telling Crabbe it
wasn’t Crabbe’s business what he was doing . . . so what’s he telling all
these . . . all these . . .”
Harry’s voice tailed away; he was staring at the fire.
“God, I’ve been stupid,” he said quietly. “It’s obvious, isn’t it? There was a
great vat of it down in the dungeon. . . . He could’ve nicked some any time

“Nicked what?” said Ron.
“Polyjuice Potion. He stole some of the Polyjuice Potion Slughorn showed
us in our first Potions lesson. . . . There aren’t a whole variety of students
standing guard for Malfoy . . . it’s just Crabbe and Goyle as usual. . . . Yeah, it
all fits!” said Harry, jumping up and starting to pace in front of the fire.
“They’re stupid enough to do what they’re told even if he won’t tell them

“Yeah, it’s great,” said Ron glumly, who was attempting to mop up the
sodden mass of ink that had recently been an almost completed essay.
Hermione pulled it toward her and began siphoning the ink off with her wand.
“But what’s all this about him going up there with a ‘variety of students’?”
said Hermione. “How many people are in on it? You wouldn’t think he’d trust
lots of them to know what he’s doing. . . .”

“Polyjuice Potion. He stole some of the Polyjuice Potion Slu w did you escape from Azkaban?”
Crouch took a deep, shuddering breath, then began to speak in a flat,
expressionless voice.
“My mother saved me. She knew she was dying. She persuaded my father
to rescue me as a last favor to her. He loved her as he had never loved me. He
agreed. They came to visit me. They gave me a draught of Polyjuice Potion

Winky was shaking her head, trembling.
“Say no more, Master Barty, say no more, you is getting your father into

But Crouch took another deep breath and continued in the same flat voice.“The dementors are blind. They sensed one healthy, one dying person

the snake hiding somewhere? Did it just come out and kill her and attackyou?”
“No,” he said. “
She
 was the snake . . . or the snake was her . . . all along.”
“W-what?”
He closed his eyes. He could still smell Bathilda’s house on him: It made
the whole thing horribly vivid.
“Bathilda must’ve been dead a while. The snake was . . . was inside her.
You-Know-Who put it there in Godric’s Hollow, to wait. You were right. He
knew I’d go back.”
“The snake was
 inside 
her?”
He opened his eyes again: Hermione looked revolted, nauseated.
“Lupin said there would be magic we’d never imagined,” Harry said. “She
didn’t want to talk in front of you, because it was Parseltongue, all
Parseltongue, and I didn’t realize, but of course I could understand her. Once
we were up in the room, the snake sent a message to You-Know-Who, I heard
it happen inside my head, I felt him get excited, he said to keep me there . . .
and then . . .”
He remembered the snake coming out of Bathilda’s neck: Hermione did n e getting
to the bottom of this business. He had moved forward in his chair so that,
without realizing it, he was perched on the very edge, tense as though poised
for flight.
“How come I saw through the snake’s eyes if it’s Voldemort’s thoughts I’m
sharing?”
“Do not say the Dark Lord’s name!” 
spat Snape.
There was a nasty silence. They glared at each other across the Pensieve.
“Professor Dumbledore says his name,” said Harry quietly.
“Dumbledore is an extremely powerful wizard,” Snape muttered. “While
he 
may feel secure enough to use the name . . . the rest of us . . .” He rubbed
his left forearm, apparently unconsciously, on the spot where Harry knew the
Dark Mark was burned into his skin.
“I just wanted to know,” Harry began again, forcing his voice back to
politeness, “why —”
“You seem to have visited the snake’s mind because that was where the
Dark Lord was at that particular moment,” snarled Snape. “He was possessingthe snake at the time and so you dreamed you were inside it too . . .”
“And Vol — he —  d swiftly away,
clearing the floor.
“Don’t move, Potter,” said Snape lazily, clearly enjoying the sight of Harry
standing motionless, eye to eye with the angry snake. “I’ll get rid of it. . . .”
“Allow me!” shouted Lockhart. He brandished his wand at the snake and
there was a loud bang; the snake, instead of vanishing, flew ten feet into the
air and fell back to the floor with a loud smack. Enraged, hissing furiously, it
slithered straight toward Justin Finch-Fletchley and raised itself again, fangs
exposed, poised to strike.
Harry wasn’t sure what made him do it. He wasn’t even aware of deciding
to do it. All he knew was that his legs were carrying him forward as though hewas on casters and that he had shouted stupidly at the snake, “Leave him
alone!” And miraculously — inexplicably — the snake slumped to the floor,
docile as a thick, black garden hose, its eyes now on Harry. Harry felt the fear
drain out of him. He knew the snake wouldn’t attack anyone now, though how
he knew it, he couldn’t have explained."
Who is the caretaker of Hogwarts?,Argus Filch,The caretaker of Hogwarts is Argus Filch.,"n-purpose showing her his cut hand as he helped her
tie her parcel onto her owl. . . . But the very instant that this thrilling thought
occurred, the Owlery door opened again.
Filch, the caretaker, came wheezing into the room. There were purple
patches on his sunken, veined cheeks, his jowls were aquiver and his thin gray
hair disheveled; he had obviously run here. Mrs. Norris came trotting at his
heels, gazing up at the owls overhead and mewing hungrily. There was a
restless shifting of wings from above, and a large brown owl snapped his beak
in a menacing fashion.“Aha!” said Filch, taking a flat-footed step toward Harry, his pouchy
cheeks trembling with anger. “I’ve had a tip-off that you are intending to
place a massive order for Dungbombs!”
Harry folded his arms and stared at the caretaker.
“Who told you I was ordering Dungbombs?”
Cho was looking from Harry to Filch, also frowning; the barn owl on her
arm, tired of standing on one leg, gave an admonitory hoot but she ignored it.
“I have my sources,” said  s to give you.
“First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all
pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember that aswell.”
Dumbledore’s twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley twins.
“I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that
no magic should be used between classes in the corridors.
“Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone
interested in playing for their House teams should contact Madam Hooch.
“And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor on the
right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very
painful death.”
Harry laughed, but he was one of the few who did.
“He’s not serious?” he muttered to Percy.
“Must be,” said Percy, frowning at Dumbledore. “It’s odd, because he
usually gives us a reason why we’re not allowed to go somewhere — the
forest’s full of dangerous beasts, everyone knows that. I do think he might
have told us prefects, a  excursion carefully, because he had been caught out of
bed and out-of-bounds by Filch the caretaker in the middle of the night once
before, and had no desire to repeat the experience. The Invisibility Cloak
would, of course, be essential, and as an added precaution, Harry thought he
would take the Marauder’s Map, which, next to the Cloak, was the most
useful aid to rule-breaking Harry owned. The map showed the whole of
Hogwarts, including its many shortcuts and secret passageways and, most
important of all, it revealed the people inside the castle as minuscule, labeled
dots, moving around the corridors, so that Harry would be forewarned if
somebody was approaching the bathroom.
On Thursday night, Harry sneaked up to bed, put on the Cloak, crept backdownstairs, and, just as he had done on the night when Hagrid had shown him
the dragons, waited for the portrait hole to open. This time it was Ron who
waited outside to give the Fat Lady the password (“banana fritters”). “Good
luck,” Ron muttered, climbing into t"

Dumbledore. Harry must have walked straight past him, so desperate to get to
the mirror he hadn’t noticed him.“I — I didn’t see you, sir.”
“Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you,” said Dumbledore,
and Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling.
“So,” said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with Harry,
“you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of
Erised.”
“I didn’t know it was called that, sir.”
“But I expect you’ve realized by now what it does?”
“It — well — it shows me my family —”
“And it showed your friend Ron himself as Head Boy.”
“How did you know — ?”
“I don’t need a cloak to become invisible,” said Dumbledore gently. “Now,
can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?”
Harry shook his head.
“Let me explain. The happiest man on earth would be able to use the
Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it and see
himself exactly as he is. Does that help?”
Harry thought. Then he said slo ized by now what it does?”
“It — well — it shows me my family —”
“And it showed your friend Ron himself as Head Boy.”
“How did you know — ?”

“Let me explain. The happiest man on earth would be able to use the
Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it and see
himself exactly as he is. Does that help?”
Harry thought. Then he said slowly, “It shows us what we want . . .
whatever we want . . .”
“Yes and no,” said Dumbledore quietly. “It shows us nothing more or less
than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts. You, who have never
known your family, see them standing around you. Ronald Weasley, who has
always been overshadowed by his brothers, sees himself standing alone, the
best of all of them. However, this mirror will give us neither knowledge or
truth. Men have wasted away before it, entranced by what they have seen, or
bee is is a two-way mirror. I’ve got the other. If you need to speak to me,
just say my name into it; you’ll appear in my mirror and I’ll be able to
talk in yours. James and I used to use them when we were in separate
detentions.
And Harry’s heart began to race. He remembered seeing his dead parents in
the Mirror of Erised four years ago. He was going to be able to talk to Sirius
again, right now, he knew it —
He looked around to make sure there was nobody else there; the dormitory
was quite empty. He looked back at the mirror, raised it in front of his face
with trembling hands, and said, loudly and clearly, “Sirius.”
His breath misted the surface of the glass. He held the mirror even closer,
excitement flooding through him, but the eyes blinking back at him through
the fog were definitely his own.
He wiped the mirror clear again and said, so that every syllable rang clearly
through the room, “Sirius Black!”
Nothing happened. The frustrated face looking back out of the mirror was
still, definitely, his own. . . "
What plant screams when uprooted?,Mandrake,The plant that screams when uprooted is the Devil's Snare.," stopped. There was a loud bark from the dog, but
Hermione had already jumped. She landed on Harry’s other side.
“We must be miles under the school,” she said.
“Lucky this plant thing’s here, really,” said Ron.
“Lucky!”
 shrieked Hermione. “Look at you both!”
She leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. She had to struggle
because the moment she had landed, the plant had started to twist snakelike
tendrils around her ankles. As for Harry and Ron, their legs had already been
bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing.
Hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on
her. Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off
them, but the more they strained against it, the tighter and faster the plant
wound around them.
“Stop moving!” Hermione ordered them. “I know what this is — it’s
Devil’s Snare!”
“Oh, I’m so glad we know what it’s called, that’s a great help,” snarled
Ron, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck.

curled around his chest.
“Devil’s Snare, Devil’s Snare . . . what did Professor Sprout say? — it likes
the dark and the damp —”
“So light a fire!” Harry choked.
“Yes — of course — but there’s no wood!” Hermione cried, wringing her
hands.
“HAVE YOU GONE MAD?” Ron bellowed. “ARE YOU A WITCH OR
NOT?”“Oh, right!” said Hermione, and she whipped out her wand, waved it,
muttered something, a muffled sort of thump he landed on something soft.
He sat up and felt around, his eyes not used to the gloom. It felt as though he
was sitting on some sort of plant.
“It’s okay!” he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp, which was
the open trapdoor, “it’s a soft landing, you can jump!”
Ron followed right away. He landed, sprawled next to Harry.
“What’s this stuff?” were his first words.“Dunno, some sort of plant thing. I suppose it’s here to break the fall. Come
on, Hermione!”
The distant music stopped. There was a loud bark from the dog, but

back of the sofa, jerked the gun out of Uncle Vernon’s hands, bent it into a
knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber, and threw it into a corner of
the room.
Uncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a mouse being trodden on.
“Anyway — Harry,” said the giant, turning his back on the Dursleys, “a
very happy birthday to yeh. Got summat fer yeh here — I mighta sat on it at
some point, but it’ll taste all right.”
From an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly squashed
box. Harry opened it with trembling fingers. Inside was a large, sticky
chocolate cake with 
Happy Birthday Harry
 written on it in green icing.
Harry looked up at the giant. He meant to say thank you, but the words got
lost on the way to his mouth, and what he said instead was, “Who are you?”
The giant chuckled.
“True, I haven’t introduced meself. Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and
Grounds at Hogwarts.”He held out an enormous hand and shook Harry’s whole arm.
“What about that te teeth, hoping against hope he wouldn’t — but it was
no good.
“Another half-giant, o’ course!” said Hagrid.
“’Ow dare you!” shrieked Madame Maxime. Her voice exploded through
the peaceful night air like a foghorn; behind him, Harry heard Fleur and
Roger fall out of their rosebush. “I ’ave nevair been more insulted in my life!
’Alf-giant? 
Moi?
 I ’ave — I ’ave big bones!”
She stormed away; great multicolored swarms of fairies rose into the air as
she passed, angrily pushing aside bushes. Hagrid was still sitting on the
bench, staring after her. It was much too dark to make out his expression.
Then, after about a minute, he stood up and strode away, not back to the
castle, but off out into the dark grounds in the direction of his cabin.
“C’mon,” Harry said, very quietly to Ron. “Let’s go. . . .”
But Ron didn’t move.
“What’s up?” said Harry, looking at him.
Ron looked around at Harry, his expression very serious indeed.
“Did you know?” he whispered. “About Hagrid being half-giant?”
“No,” Harry said, shrugging. “ under his weight, and
began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat: a copper kettle,
a squashy package of sausages, a poker, a teapot, several chipped mugs, and a
bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from before starting to make
tea. Soon the hut was full of the sound and smell of sizzling sausage. Nobody
said a thing while the giant was working, but as he slid the first six fat, juicy,
slightly burnt sausages from the poker, Dudley fidgeted a little. Uncle Vernon
said sharply, “Don’t touch anything he gives you, Dudley.”
The giant chuckled darkly.
“Yer great puddin’ of a son don’ need fattenin’ anymore, Dursley, don’
worry.”
He passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry he had never tasted
anything so wonderful, but he still couldn’t take his eyes off the giant. Finally,
as nobody seemed about to explain anything, he said, “I’m sorry, but I still
don’t really know who you are.”
The giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand.

Muffliato,
 a spell that filled the ears of anyone nearby with an unidentifiable
buzzing, so that lengthy conversations could be held in class without being
overheard. The only person who did not find these charms amusing was
Hermione, who maintained a rigidly disapproving expression throughout and
refused to talk at all if Harry had used the 
Muffliato
 spell on anyone in the
vicinity.
Sitting up in bed, Harry turned the book sideways so as to examine more
closely the scribbled instructions for a spell that seemed to have caused the
Prince some trouble. There were many crossings-out and alterations, but
finally, crammed into a corner of the page, the scribble:

Who is the head of Hufflepuff House?,Pomona Sprout,"The head of Hufflepuff House is not explicitly mentioned in this passage. However, it is mentioned that ""everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o' duffers"", which implies that the House has a reputation for being less prestigious than the other three Houses."," you are here, your House will be something like

“The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and
Slytherin. Each House has its own noble history and each has produced
outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs

At the end of the year, the House with the most points is awarded the House
Cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever House
becomes yours.

Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville’s cloak, which was fastened
under his left ear, and on Ron’s smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to
flatten his hair.

“Yer not

in the Leaky Cauldron was like when they saw yeh. Anyway, what does he
know about it, some o’ the best I ever saw were the only ones with magic in

sister!”
“So what 
is
 Quidditch?”“It’s our sport. Wizard sport. It’s like — like soccer in the Muggle world —
everyone follows Quidditch — played up in the air on broomsticks and
there’s four balls — sorta hard ter explain the rules.”
“And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?”
“School Houses. There’s four. Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o’
duffers, but —”
“I bet I’m in Hufflepuff,” said Harry gloomily.
“Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin,” said Hagrid darkly. “There’s not a
single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn’t in Slytherin. You-Know-
Who was one.”
“Vol-, sorry — You-Know-Who was  cer in the Muggle world —

“Years an’ years ago,” said Hagrid.
They bought Harry’s school books in a shop called Flourish and Blotts
where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as paving
stones bound in leather; books the size of postage stamps in covers of silk;
books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with nothing in them at all.
Even Dudley, who never read anything, would have been wild to get his
hands on some of these. Hagrid almost had to drag Harry away from

Careful not to blink, Harry stared up into Buckbeak’s fierce orange eyes
once more and bowed. Buckbeak sank to his scaly knees and then stood up
again. Harry began to fumble with the knot of rope tying Buckbeak to the
fence.

Committee’s appointed executioner, Walden Macnair . . .”
“Come on, Buckbeak,” Harry murmured, “come on, we’re going to help
you. Quietly . . . quietly . . .”
“ . . . 
as witnessed below.
 Hagrid, you sign here. . . .”
Harry threw all his weight onto the rope, but Buckbeak had dug in his front
feet.
“Well, let’s get this over with,” said the reedy voice of the Committee
member from inside Hagrid’s cabin. “Hagrid, perhaps it will be better if you
stay inside —”
“No, I — I wan’ ter be with him. . . . I don’ wan’ him ter be alone —”
Footsteps echoed from within the cabin.“Buckbeak, move!”
 Harry hissed.
Harry tugged harder on the rope around Buckbeak’s neck. The hi ing flat on his back with his arms and legs in the
air, gave Harry one upside-down look of deepest loathing and, with another
loud crack, vanished.
“Good,” said Dumbledore. “There is also the matter of the hippogriff,
Buckbeak. Hagrid has been looking after him since Sirius died, but Buckbeak
is yours now, so if you would prefer to make different arrangements —”
“No,” said Harry at once, “he can stay with Hagrid. I think Buckbeak
would prefer that.”
“Hagrid will be delighted,” said Dumbledore, smiling. “He was thrilled to
see Buckbeak again. Incidentally, we have decided, in the interests of
Buckbeak’s safety, to rechristen him ‘Witherwings’ for the time being, though
I doubt that the Ministry would ever guess he is the hippogriff they once
sentenced to death. Now, Harry, is your trunk packed?”
“Erm . . .”
“Doubtful that I would turn up?” Dumbledore suggested shrewdly.
“I’ll just go and — er — finish off,” said Harry hastily, hurrying to pick up
his fallen telescope and trainers.
It took him a little over ten ve her a leg up.
Then he placed his foot on one of the lower branches of the bush and climbed
up in front of her. He pulled Buckbeak’s rope back over his neck and tied it to
the other side of his collar like reins.
“Ready?” he whispered to Hermione. “You’d better hold on to me —”
He nudged Buckbeak’s sides with his heels.
Buckbeak soared straight into the dark air. Harry gripped his flanks with his
knees, feeling the great wings rising powerfully beneath them. Hermione was
holding Harry very tight around the waist; he could hear her muttering, “Oh,
no — I don’t like this — oh, I 
really
 don’t like this —”
Harry urged Buckbeak forward. They were gliding quietly toward the
upper floors of the castle. . . . Harry pulled hard on the left-hand side of the
rope, and Buckbeak turned. Harry was trying to count the windows flashing
past —
“Whoa!” he said, pulling backward as hard as he could.
Buckbeak slowed down and they found themselves at a stop, unless you
counted the fact that they kept rising up and down severa"
Who is the founder of Gryffindor House?,Godric Gryffindor,"The founder of Gryffindor House is Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, also known as Nearly Headless Nick.","” inquired
Ron. He was tugging at the chain of the Horcrux around his neck: Harry was
visited by a desire to seize it and throttle him.
“You told us that You-Know-Who asked Dumbledore to give him a job
after he left,” said Hermione.
“That’s right,” said Harry.
“And Dumbledore thought he only wanted to come back to try and find
something, probably another founder’s object, to make into another
Horcrux?”
“Yeah,” said Harry.
“But he didn’t get the job, did he?” said Hermione. “So he never got the
chance to find a founder’s object there and hide it in the school!”
“Okay, then,” said Harry, defeated. “Forget Hogwarts.”
Without any other leads, they traveled into London and, hidden beneath the
Invisibility Cloak, searched for the orphanage in which Voldemort had been
raised. Hermione stole into a library and discovered from their records that
the place had been demolished many years before. They visited its site and
found a tower block of offices.
“We could try digging in the foundations?” Hermione suggested

“I shall return when we are r was in Dumbledore’s office,
knowing he would shortly be telling him about the dream. Harry looked up at
the walls behind the desk. The patched and ragged Sorting Hat was standing
on a shelf. A glass case next to it held a magnificent silver sword with large
rubies set into the hilt, which Harry recognized as the one he himself had
pulled out of the Sorting Hat in his second year. The sword had once belonged
to Godric Gryffindor, founder of Harry’s House. He was gazing at it,
remembering how it had come to his aid when he had thought all hope was
lost, when he noticed a patch of silvery light, dancing and shimmering on the
glass case. He looked around for the source of the light and saw a sliver of
silver-white shining brightly from within a black cabinet behind him, whose
door had not been closed properly. Harry hesitated, glanced at Fawkes, then
got up, walked across the office, and pulled open the cabinet door.A shallow stone basin lay there, with odd carvings around the edge: runes

“Yeah, we don’t need to hear about you being in love with Malfoy,” Harry
told Kreacher. “Let’s fast forward to where he’s actually been going.”
Kreacher bowed again, looking furious, and then said, “Master Malfoy eats

Salazar Slytherin himself, through my mother’s side? I, keep the name of a

because he found out his wife was a witch? No, Harry — I fashioned myself a
new name, a name I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak,when I had become the greatest sorcerer in the world!”
Harry’s brain seemed to have jammed. He stared numbly at Riddle, at the
orphaned boy who had grown up to murder Harry’s own parents, and so many
others. . . . At last he forced himself to speak.
“You’re not,” he said, his quiet voice full of hatred.
“Not what?” snapped Riddle.

Harry released him; Dobby straightened his tea cozy and said defiantly to

told Kreacher. “Let’s fast forward to where he’s actually been going.”
