Who is Harry Potter's best friend?,Ron Weasley,"According to the context, Harry's best friend was Sirius Black and James Potter.","say you remember him at Hogwarts, Rosmerta,” murmured Professor
McGonagall. “Do you remember who his best friend was?”
“Naturally,” said Madam Rosmerta, with a small laugh. “Never saw one
without the other, did you? The number of times I had them in here — ooh,
they used to make me laugh. Quite the double act, Sirius Black and James
Potter!”
Harry dropped his tankard with a loud clunk. Ron kicked him.
“Precisely,” said Professor McGonagall. “Black and Potter. Ringleaders of
their little gang. Both very bright, of course — exceptionally bright, in fact —
but I don’t think we’ve ever had such a pair of troublemakers —”
“I dunno,” chuckled Hagrid. “Fred and George Weasley could give ’em a
run fer their money.”
“You’d have thought Black and Potter were brothers!” chimed in Professor
Flitwick. “Inseparable!”
“Of course they were,” said Fudge. “Potter trusted Black beyond all his
other friends. Nothing changed when they left school. Black was best man
when James married Lily. Then they named him godfather to Harry. or
companionship on his trip to Diagon Alley. He preferred to operate alone. The
adult Voldemort is the same. You will hear many of his Death Eaters claiming
that they are in his confidence, that they alone are close to him, even
understand him. They are deluded. Lord Voldemort has never had a friend,
nor do I believe that he has ever wanted one.
“And lastly — I hope you are not too sleepy to pay attention to this, Harry
— the young Tom Riddle liked to collect trophies. You saw the box of stolen
articles he had hidden in his room. These were taken from victims of his
bullying behavior, souvenirs, if you will, of particularly unpleasant bits of
magic. Bear in mind this magpie-like tendency, for this, particularly, will be
important later.“And now, it really is time for bed.”
Harry got to his feet. As he walked across the room, his eyes fell upon the
little table on which Marvolo Gaunt’s ring had rested last time, but the ring
was no longer there.
“Yes, Harry?” said Dumbledore, for Harry had come to a halt.
“Th AMILY!”
And he threw the receiver back onto the telephone as if dropping a
poisonous spider.The fight that had followed had been one of the worst ever.
“HOW DARE YOU GIVE THIS NUMBER TO PEOPLE LIKE —
PEOPLE LIKE 
YOU
!”
 
Uncle Vernon had roared, spraying Harry with spit.
Ron obviously realized that he’d gotten Harry into trouble, because he
hadn’t called again. Harry’s other best friend from Hogwarts, Hermione
Granger, hadn’t been in touch either. Harry suspected that Ron had warned
Hermione not to call, which was a pity, because Hermione, the cleverest witch
in Harry’s year, had Muggle parents, knew perfectly well how to use a
telephone, and would probably have had enough sense not to say that she
went to Hogwarts.
So Harry had had no word from any of his wizarding friends for five long
weeks, and this summer was turning out to be almost as bad as the last one.
There was just one very small improvement — after swearing that he
wouldn’t use her to send letters to any of his friends, Harry had been allowed
to ere you’re going, Potter!”
“Sorry, Professor —”
“I’ve just been looking for you in the Gryffindor common room. Well, here
it is, we’ve done everything we could think of, and there doesn’t seem to be
anything wrong with it at all. You’ve got a very good friend somewhere,Potter. . . .”
Harry’s jaw dropped. She was holding out his Firebolt, and it looked as
magnificent as ever.
“I can have it back?” Harry said weakly. “Seriously?”
“Seriously,” said Professor McGonagall, and she was actually smiling. “I
daresay you’ll need to get the feel of it before Saturday’s match, won’t you?
And Potter — 
do
 try and win, won’t you? Or we’ll be out of the running for
the eighth year in a row, as Professor Snape was kind enough to remind me
only last night. . . .”
Speechless, Harry carried the Firebolt back upstairs toward Gryffindor
Tower. As he turned a corner, he saw Ron dashing toward him, grinning from
ear to ear.
“She gave it to you? Excellent! Listen, can I still have a go on it?
Tomorrow?”
“Yeah . . . anything . . . , his, “likes his comfort. He also likes the company of the famous, the
successful, and the powerful. He enjoys the feeling that he influences these
people. He has never wanted to occupy the throne himself; he prefers the
backseat — more room to spread out, you see. He used to handpick favorites
at Hogwarts, sometimes for their ambition or their brains, sometimes for their
charm or their talent, and he had an uncanny knack for choosing those who
would go on to become outstanding in their various fields. Horace formed a
kind of club of his favorites with himself at the center, making introductions,
forging useful contacts between members, and always reaping some kind of
benefit in return, whether a free box of his favorite crystalized pineapple or
the chance to recommend the next junior member of the Goblin Liaison
Office.”
Harry had a sudden and vivid mental image of a great swollen spider,
spinning a web around it, twitching a thread here and there to bring its large
and juicy flies a little closer.
“I tell yo  friend.
He’s a convicted murderer, but he’s broken out of Wizard prison and he’s on
the run. He likes to keep in touch with me, though . . . keep up with my
news . . . check if I’m happy. . . .”
And, grinning broadly at the look of horror on Uncle Vernon’s face, Harry
set off toward the station exit, Hedwig rattling along in front of him, for what
looked like a much better summer than the last.

looked from Hermione to Harry, who was sitting next to her.
“Oho! 
‘One of my best friends is Muggle-born, and she’s the best in our
year!’
 I’m assuming this is the very friend of whom you spoke, Harry?”
“Yes, sir,” said Harry.
“Well, well, take twenty well-earned points for Gryffindor, Miss Granger,”
said Slughorn genially.
Malfoy looked rather as he had done the time Hermione had punched him
in the face. Hermione turned to Harry with a radiant expression and
whispered, “Did you really tell him I’m the best in the year? Oh, Harry!”
“Well, what’s so impressive about that?” whispered Ron, who for somereason looked annoyed. “You 
are
 the best in the year — I’d’ve told him so if
he’d asked me!”
Hermione smiled but made a “shhing” gesture, so that they could hear what
Slughorn was saying. Ron looked slightly disgruntled.

manufacture or imitate love. No, this will sim nspiring and the best loved of all Hogwarts headmasters cannot be in
question. He died as he lived: working always for the greater good and,
to his last hour, as willing to stretch out a hand to a small boy with
dragon pox as he was on the day that I met him.
Harry finished reading but continued to gaze at the picture accompanying
the obituary. Dumbledore was wearing his familiar, kindly smile, but as he
peered over the top of his half-moon spectacles, he gave the impression, even
in newsprint, of X-raying Harry, whose sadness mingled with a sense of
humiliation.
He had thought he knew Dumbledore quite well, but ever since reading this
obituary he had been forced to recognize that he had barely known him at all.
Never once had he imagined Dumbledore’s childhood or youth; it was as
though he had sprung into being as Harry had known him, venerable and
silver-haired and old. The idea of a teenage Dumbledore was simply odd, like
trying to imagine a stupid Hermione or a friendly Blast-Ended Skrewt.
He had never th"
What house is Harry Potter sorted into?,Gryffindor,"According to the text, Harry Potter is sorted into... Gryffindor!"," you are here, your House will be something like
your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your
House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free time in your House
common room.
“The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and
Slytherin. Each House has its own noble history and each has produced
outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs
will earn your House points, while any rule-breaking will lose House points.
At the end of the year, the House with the most points is awarded the House
Cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever House
becomes yours.
“The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest
of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can
while you are waiting.”
Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville’s cloak, which was fastened
under his left ear, and on Ron’s smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to
flatten his hair.
“I shall return when we are r rom a doorway to the right — the
rest of the school must already be here — but Professor McGonagall showed
the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in,
standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering
about nervously.
“Welcome to Hogwarts,” said Professor McGonagall. “The start-of-term
banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall,
you will be sorted into your Houses. The Sorting is a very importantceremony because, while you are here, your House will be something like
your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your

Slytherin. Each House has its own noble history and each has produced
outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs
will earn your House points, while any rule-breaking will lose House points.
At the end of the House you’ll be in?
I’ve been asking around, and I hope I’m in Gryffindor, it sounds by far the
best; I hear Dumbledore himself was in it, but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn’t
be too bad. . . . Anyway, we’d better go and look for Neville’s toad. You two
had better change, you know, I expect we’ll be there soon.”
And she left, taking the toadless boy with her.“Whatever House I’m in, I hope she’s not in it,” said Ron. He threw his
wand back into his trunk. “Stupid spell — George gave it to me, bet he knew
it was a dud.”
“What House are your brothers in?” asked Harry.
“Gryffindor,” said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling on him again. “Mum
and Dad were in it, too. I don’t know what they’ll say if I’m not. I don’t
suppose Ravenclaw 
would
 be too bad, but imagine if they put me in
Slytherin.”
“That’s the House Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who was in?”
“Yeah,” said Ron. He flopped back into his seat, looking depressed.
“You know, I think the ends of Scabbers’ whiskers are a bit lighter,” said
Harry, trying to take Ron’s mind   year, the House with the most points is awarded the House
Cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever House

“The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest
of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can
while you are waiting.”
Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville’s cloak, which was fastened
under his left ear, and on Ron’s smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to
flatten his hair.
“I shall return when we are ready for you,” said Professor McGonagall.
“Please wait quietly.”
She left the chamber. Harry swallowed.
“How exactly do they sort us into Houses?” he asked Ron.
“Some sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think he was
joking.”
Harry’s heart gave a horrible jolt. A test? In front of the whole school? But
he didn’t know any magic yet — what on earth would he have to do? He
hadn’t expected something like this the moment they arrived. He looked
around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked  Harry, intrigued.
“Okay,” Harry said, starting off back down the corridor with Hermione,
Ron hurrying to keep up.
“Oh don’t mind me!” the Fat Lady called irritably after them. “Don’t
apologize for bothering me! I’ll just hang here, wide open, until you get back,
shall I?”
“Yeah, thanks!” Ron shouted over his shoulder.
“Hermione, where are we going?” Harry asked, after she had led themdown through six floors, and started down the marble staircase into the
entrance hall.
“You’ll see, you’ll see in a minute!” said Hermione excitedly.
She turned left at the bottom of the staircase and hurried toward the door
through which Cedric Diggory had gone the night after the Goblet of Fire had
regurgitated his and Harry’s names. Harry had never been through here
before. He and Ron followed Hermione down a flight of stone steps, but
instead of ending up in a gloomy underground passage like the one that led to
Snape’s dungeon, they found themselves in a broad stone corridor, brightly lit
with torches, and decorated with che rey, who left for the
hospital wing, muttering to herself. He had to wait only a few minutes; then
Hermione emerged looking very happy about something, followed by
Professor McGonagall, and the three of them made their way back down the
marble staircase to the Great Hall.
It was a sea of pointed black hats; each of the long House tables was lined
with students, their faces glimmering by the light of thousands of candles,
which were floating over the tables in midair. Professor Flitwick, who was a
tiny little wizard with a shock of white hair, was carrying an ancient hat and a
four-legged stool out of the hall.
“Oh,” said Hermione softly, “we’ve missed the Sorting!”
New students at Hogwarts were sorted into Houses by trying on the Sorting
Hat, which shouted out the House they were best suited to (Gryffindor,
Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, or Slytherin). Professor McGonagall strode off toward
her empty seat at the staff table, and Harry and Hermione set off in the other
direction, as quietly as possible, toward the Gry all and up the stairs, looking around
with much curiosity and interest.
“Funny place,” she said, “it’s a bit 
too
 clean, d’you know what I mean? Bit
unnatural. Oh, this is better,” she added, as they entered Harry’s bedroom and
he turned on the light.
His room was certainly much messier than the rest of the house. Confined
to it for four days in a very bad mood, Harry had not bothered tidying up after
himself. Most of the books he owned were strewn over the floor where he’d
tried to distract himself with each in turn and thrown it aside. Hedwig’s cage
needed cleaning out and was starting to smell, and his trunk lay open,
revealing a jumbled mixture of Muggle clothes and wizard’s robes that had
spilled onto the floor around it.
Harry started picking up books and throwing them hastily into his trunk.
Tonks paused at his open wardrobe to look critically at her reflection in the
mirror on the inside of the door.
“You know, I don’t think purple’s really my color,” she said pensively,
tugging at a lock of spiky ha l
area, just in case. So, we’ve given a dozen different houses every protection
we can throw at them. They all look like they could be the place we’re going
to hide you, they’ve all got some connection with the Order: my house,
Kingsley’s place, Molly’s Auntie Muriel’s — you get the idea.”
“Yeah,” said Harry, not entirely truthfully, because he could still spot a
gaping hole in the plan.
“You’ll be going to Tonks’s parents. Once you’re within the boundaries of
the protective enchantments we’ve put on their house, you’ll be able to use a
Portkey to the Burrow. Any questions?”
“Er — yes,” said Harry. “Maybe they won’t know which of the twelve
secure houses I’m heading for at first, but won’t it be sort of obvious once” —
he performed a quick headcount — “fourteen of us fly off toward Tonks’s
parents’?”
“Ah,” said Moody, “I forgot to mention the key point. Fourteen of us won’t
be flying to Tonks’s parents’. There will be seven Harry Potters moving
through the skies tonight, each of them with a companion, each pa"
What is the name of Harry Potter's owl?,Hedwig,The name of Harry Potter's owl is Hedwig.,"rry Potter’s, incidentally, who fought the Death Eaters
alongside him at the Ministry in June and —”
But the rest of this story was obscured by the large birdcage standing on
top of it. Inside it was a magnificent snowy owl. Her amber eyes surveyed the
room imperiously, her head swiveling occasionally to gaze at her snoring
master. Once or twice she clicked her beak impatiently, but Harry was too
deeply asleep to hear her.
A large trunk stood in the very middle of the room. Its lid was open; it
looked expectant; yet it was almost empty but for a residue of old underwear,
sweets, empty ink bottles, and broken quills that coated the very bottom.
Nearby, on the floor, lay a purple leaflet emblazoned with the words:

motionless. There was a large package tied to its legs.
Harry recognized the unconscious owl at once — his name was Errol, and
he belonged to the Weasley family. Harry dashed to the bed, untied the cords
around Errol’s legs, took off the parcel, and then carried Errol to Hedwig’s
cage. Errol opened one bleary eye, gave a feeble hoot of thanks, and began to
gulp some water.
Harry turned back to the remaining owls. One of them, the large snowy
female, was his own Hedwig. She, too, was carrying a parcel and looked
extremely pleased with herself. She gave Harry an affectionate nip with her
beak as he removed her burden, then flew across the room to join Errol.
Harry didn’t recognize the third owl, a handsome tawny one, but he knew
at once where it had come from, because in addition to a third package, it was
carrying a letter bearing the Hogwarts crest. When Harry relieved this owl of
its burden, it ruffled its feathers importantly, stretched its wings, and took off sick of finding everything out from the
Slytherins.”
“Good thinking!” said Harry, also looking up at the owls. “Hey, Hermione,
I think you’re in luck —”
A gray owl was soaring down toward Hermione.“It hasn’t got a newspaper, though,” she said, looking disappointed. “It’s
—”
But to her bewilderment, the gray owl landed in front of her plate, closely
followed by four barn owls, a brown owl, and a tawny.
“How many subscriptions did you take out?” said Harry, seizing
Hermione’s goblet before it was knocked over by the cluster of owls, all of
whom were jostling close to her, trying to deliver their own letter first.
“What on earth — ?” Hermione said, taking the letter from the gray owl,
opening it, and starting to read. “Oh really!” she sputtered, going rather red.
“What’s up?” said Ron.
“It’s — oh how ridiculous —”
She thrust the letter at Harry, who saw that it was not handwritten, but
composed from pasted letters that seemed to have been cut out of the

“Harry!” said Hermione breathlessly, plunging her hands into the feathery
mass and pulling out a screech owl bearing a long, cylindrical package. “I
think I know what this means — open this one first!”
Harry ripped off the brown packaging. Out rolled a tightly furled copy of
March’s edition of 
The Quibbler. 
He unrolled it to see his own face grinning
sheepishly at him from the front cover. In large red letters across his picture
were the words:

“It’s good, isn’t it?” said Luna, who had drifted over to the Gryffindor table
and now squeezed herself onto the bench between Fred and Ron. “It came out
yesterday, I asked Dad to send you a free copy. I expect all these,” she waved
a hand at the assembled owls still scrabbling around on the table in front of
Harry, “are letters from readers.”
“That’s what I thought,” said Hermione eagerly, “Harry, d’you mind if we— rmione’s Secret
 
TWENTY-TWO
Owl Post AgainH
 
CHAPTER  ONE
OWL POST
arry Potter was a highly unusual boy in many ways. For one thing, he
hated the summer holidays more than any other time of year. For
another, he really wanted to do his homework but was forced to do it in
secret, in the dead of night. And he also happened to be a wizard.
It was nearly midnight, and he was lying on his stomach in bed, the
blankets drawn right over his head like a tent, a flashlight in one hand and a
large leather-bound book (
A History of Magic
 by Bathilda Bagshot) propped
open against the pillow. Harry moved the tip of his eagle-feather quill down
the page, frowning as he looked for something that would help him write his
essay, “Witch Burning in the Fourteenth Century Was Completely Pointless
— discuss.”
The quill paused at the top of a likely-looking paragraph. Harry pushed his
round glasses up the bridge of his nose, moved his flashlight closer to the
book, and read:
Non-magic people (more commonly known as Muggles) were We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a listof all necessary books and equipment.
Term begins on September 1. We await your owl by no later than July
31.
Yours sincerely,
Minerva McGonagall,
Deputy Headmistress
Questions exploded inside Harry’s head like fireworks and he couldn’t decide
which to ask first. After a few minutes he stammered, “What does it mean,
they await my owl?”
“Gallopin’ Gorgons, that reminds me,” said Hagrid, clapping a hand to his
forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse, and from yet another
pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl — a real, live, rather ruffled-
looking owl — a long quill, and a roll of parchment. With his tongue between
his teeth he scribbled a note that Harry could read upside down:
Dear Professor Dumbledore,
Given Harry his letter.
Taking him to buy his things tomorrow.
Weather’s horrible. Hope you’re well.
Hagrid
Hagrid rolled up the note, gave it to the owl, which nce: A
dazed and ruffled-looking barn owl was sitting outside on the kitchen sill,
having just collided with the closed window.
Ignoring Uncle Vernon’s anguished yell of “OWLS!” Harry crossed the
room at a run and wrenched the window open again. The owl stuck out its leg,
to which a small roll of parchment was tied, shook its feathers, and took off
the moment Harry had pulled off the letter. Hands shaking, Harry unfurled the
second message, which was written very hastily and blotchily in black ink.
Harry 
—
Dumbledore’s just arrived at the Ministry, and he’s trying to sort it all
out. DO NOT LEAVE YOUR AUNT AND UNCLE’S HOUSE. DO NOT
DO ANY MORE MAGIC. DO NOT SURRENDER YOUR WAND.
Dumbledore was trying to sort it all out. . . . What did that mean? How
much power did Dumbledore have to override the Ministry of Magic? Was
there a chance that he might be allowed back to Hogwarts, then? A small
shoot of hope burgeoned in Harry’s chest, almost immediately strangled by
panic — how was he supposed to refuse to surrend 
“Whose owl am I going to use?” Harry said as they climbed the stairs. “Hetold me not to use Hedwig again.”
“Ask Ron if you can borrow —”
“I’m not asking Ron for anything,” Harry said flatly.
“Well, borrow one of the school owls, then, anyone can use them,” said
Hermione.
They went up to the Owlery. Hermione gave Harry a piece of parchment, a
quill, and a bottle of ink, then strolled around the long lines of perches,
looking at all the different owls, while Harry sat down against a wall and
wrote his letter.
Dear Sirius,
You told me to keep you posted on what’s happening at Hogwarts,
so here goes — 
I don’t know if you’ve heard, but the Triwizard
Tournament’s happening this year and on Saturday night I got
picked as a fourth champion. I don’t know who put my name in the
Goblet of Fire, because I didn’t. The other Hogwarts champion is
Cedric Diggory, from Hufflepuff.
He paused at this point, thinking. He had an urge to say something about
the large weight of anxiety that seemed to have settled inside his chest"

parchment.
A large picture of a familiar, hook-nosed, black-haired man stared up at
them all, beneath a headline that read:
SEVERUS SNAPE CONFIRMED AS HOGWARTS HEADMASTER
“No!” said Ron and Hermione loudly.
Hermione was quickest; she snatched up the newspaper and began to read
the accompanying story out loud.
“‘Severus Snape, long-standing Potions master at Hogwarts School of
Witchcraft and Wizardry, was today appointed headmaster in the most
important of several staffing changes at the ancient school. Following the
resignation of the previous Muggle Studies teacher, Alecto Carrow will take
over the post while her brother, Amycus, fills the position of Defense Against
the Dark Arts professor.
“
‘I welcome the opportunity to uphold our finest Wizarding traditions and
values —’ 
Like committing murder and cutting off people’s ears, I suppose!
Snape, headmaster! Snape in Dumbledore’s study — Merlin’s pants!” she
shrieked, making both Harry and Ron jump. She leapt up from the table and
hurtled from the room,  unfolded it, and read it, with Ron,
Seamus, Dean, and Neville looking over his shoulder. It was an article topped
with a picture of Hagrid looking extremely shifty.
DUMBLEDORE’S GIANT MISTAKE
Albus Dumbledore, eccentric headmaster of Hogwarts School of
Witchcraft and Wizardry, has never been afraid to make
controversial staff appointments, 
writes Rita Skeeter, Special
Correspondent.
 In September of this year, he hired Alastor “Mad-
Eye” Moody, the notoriously jinx-happy ex-Auror, to teach Defense
Against the Dark Arts, a decision that caused many raised eyebrows
at the Ministry of Magic, given Moody’s well-known habit of
attacking anybody who makes a sudden movement in his presence.
Mad-Eye Moody, however, looks responsible and kindly when set
beside the part-human Dumbledore employs to teach Care ofMagical Creatures.
Rubeus Hagrid, who admits to being expelled from Hogwarts in
his third year, has enjoyed the position of gamekeeper at the school
ever since, a job secured for him by Dumbledore. Last year,
ho werewolf Remus Lupin, half-giant Rubeus Hagrid, and delusional
ex-Auror ‘Mad-Eye’ Moody.
“Rumors abound, of course, that Albus Dumbledore, once Supreme
Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards and Chief Warlock
of the Wizengamot, is no longer up to the task of managing the prestigious
school of Hogwarts.
“‘I think the appointment of the Inquisitor is a first step toward ensuring
that Hogwarts has a headmaster in whom we can all repose confidence,’ said
a Ministry insider last night.
“Wizengamot elders Griselda Marchbanks and Tiberius Ogden have
resigned in protest at the introduction of the post of Inquisitor to Hogwarts.
“‘Hogwarts is a school, not an outpost of Cornelius Fudge’s office,’ said
Madam Marchbanks. ‘This is a further disgusting attempt to discredit Albus
Dumbledore.’ (For a full account of Madam Marchbanks’ alleged links to
subversive goblin groups, turn to page 17.)”
Hermione finished reading and looked across the table at the other two.
“So now we know how we ended up with Umbridg eing
subjected to fair and objective evaluation,’ said Mr. Lucius Malfoy, 41,
speaking from his Wiltshire mansion last night. ‘Many of us with our
children’s best interests at heart have been concerned about some of
Dumbledore’s eccentric decisions in the last few years and will be glad to
know that the Ministry is keeping an eye on the situation.’“Among those ‘eccentric decisions’ are undoubtedly the controversial staff
appointments previously described in this newspaper, which have included the
hiring of werewolf Remus Lupin, half-giant Rubeus Hagrid, and delusional
ex-Auror ‘Mad-Eye’ Moody.
“Rumors abound, of course, that Albus Dumbledore, once Supreme
Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards and Chief Warlock
of the Wizengamot, is no longer up to the task of managing the prestigious
school of Hogwarts.
“‘I think the appointment of the Inquisitor is a first step toward ensuring
that Hogwarts has a headmaster in whom we can all repose confidence,’ said
a Ministry insider last night.
“Wizengamot eep-seated
confusion.
“He might even be pretending,” said one specialist. “This could
be a plea for attention.”
The 
Daily Prophet,
 however, has unearthed worrying facts about
Harry Potter that Albus Dumbledore, headmaster of Hogwarts, has
carefully concealed from the Wizarding public.
“Potter can speak Parseltongue,” reveals Draco Malfoy, a
Hogwarts fourth year. “There were a lot of attacks on students acouple of years ago, and most people thought Potter was behind
them after they saw him lose his temper at a dueling club and set a
snake on another boy. It was all hushed up, though. But he’s made
friends with werewolves and giants too. We think he’d do anything
for a bit of power.”
Parseltongue, the ability to converse with snakes, has long been
considered a Dark Art. Indeed, the most famous Parselmouth of our
times is none other than You-Know-Who himself. A member of the
Dark Force Defense League, who wished to remain unnamed, stated
that he would regard any wizard who could speak Parseltongue “as
worthy o  at Hogwarts,” said Harry. “I mean, there’s Dumbledore, for one
thing — you know who Dumbledore is, don’t you?”
Dobby bowed his head.
“Albus Dumbledore is the greatest headmaster Hogwarts has ever had.
Dobby knows it, sir. Dobby has heard Dumbledore’s powers rival those of
He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named at the height of his strength. But, sir” —
Dobby’s voice dropped to an urgent whisper — “there are powers
Dumbledore doesn’t . . . powers no decent wizard . . .”
And before Harry could stop him, Dobby bounded off the bed, seized
Harry’s desk lamp, and started beating himself around the head with
earsplitting yelps.A sudden silence fell downstairs. Two seconds later Harry, heart thudding
madly, heard Uncle Vernon coming into the hall, calling, “Dudley must have
left his television on again, the little tyke!”
“Quick! In the closet!” hissed Harry, stuffing Dobby in, shutting the door,
and flinging himself onto the bed just as the door handle turned.
“What — the —

Like committing murder and cutting off people’s ears, I suppose!
Snape, headmaster! Snape in Dumbledore’s study — Merlin’s pants!” she
shrieked, making both Harry and Ron jump. She leapt up from the table and
hurtled from the room, shouting as she went, “I’ll be back in a minute!”
“‘Merlin’s pants’?” repeated Ron, looking amused. “She must be upset.”
He pulled the newspaper toward him and perused the article about Snape.
“The other teachers won’t stand for this. McGonagall and Flitwick and
Sprout all know the truth, they know how Dumbledore died. They won’t
accept Snape as headmaster. And who are these Carrows?”
“Death Eaters,” said Harry. “There are pictures of them inside. They were
at the top of the tower when Snape killed Dumbledo nspiring and the best loved of all Hogwarts headmasters cannot be in
question. He died as he lived: working always for the greater good and,
to his last hour, as willing to stretch out a hand to a small boy with
dragon pox as he was on the day that I met him.
Harry finished reading but continued to gaze at the picture accompanying
the obituary. Dumbledore was wearing his familiar, kindly smile, but as he
peered over the top of his half-moon spectacles, he gave the impression, even
in newsprint, of X-raying Harry, whose sadness mingled with a sense of
humiliation.
He had thought he knew Dumbledore quite well, but ever since reading this
obituary he had been forced to recognize that he had barely known him at all.
Never once had he imagined Dumbledore’s childhood or youth; it was as
though he had sprung into being as Harry had known him, venerable and
silver-haired and old. The idea of a teenage Dumbledore was simply odd, like
trying to imagine a stupid Hermione or a friendly Blast-Ended Skrewt.

Anthony Goldstein, his own wand would fly out of his hand, yet Anthony did
not seem to be making a sound. Harry did not have to look far for the solution
of the mystery, however; Fred and George were several feet from Smith and
taking it in turns to point their wands at his back.
“Sorry, Harry,” said George hastily, when Harry caught his eye. “Couldn’t
resist . . .”
Harry walked around the other pairs, trying to correct those who were
doing the spell wrong. Ginny was teamed with Michael Corner; she was
doing very well, whereas Michael was either very bad or unwilling to jinx her.
Ernie Macmillan was flourishing his wand unnecessarily, giving his partner
time to get in under his guard; the Creevey brothers were enthusiastic but
erratic and mainly responsible for all the books leaping off the shelves around
them. Luna Lovegood was similarly patchy, occasionally sending Justin
Finch-Fletchley’s wand spinning out of his hand, at other times merely
causing his hair to stand on end.
“Okay, stop!” Harry s f Zacharias
Smith, who had jeered at Harry for wanting to teach Dumbledore’s Army how
to Disarm.
“Yes, Harry,” said Lupin with painful restraint, “and a great number of
Death Eaters witnessed that happening! Forgive me, but it was a very unusual
move then, under imminent threat of death. Repeating it tonight in front of
Death Eaters who either witnessed or heard about the first occasion was close
to suicidal!”
“So you think I should have killed Stan Shunpike?” said Harry angrily.
“Of course not,” said Lupin, “but the Death Eaters — frankly, most people!
— would have expected you to attack back! Expelliarmus is a useful spell,
Harry, but the Death Eaters seem to think it is your signature move, and I urgeyou not to let it become so!”
Lupin was making Harry feel idiotic, and yet there was still a grain of
defiance inside him.
“I won’t blast people out of my way just because they’re there,” said Harry.
“That’s Voldemort’s job.”
Lupin’s retort was lost: Finally succeeding in squeezing through the door,
Hagrid sta  and found himself facing a
Blast-Ended Skrewt.
Cedric was right — it 
was
 enormous. Ten feet long, it looked more like a
giant scorpion than anything. Its long sting was curled over its back. Its thick
armor glinted in the light from Harry’s wand, which he pointed at it.
“Stupefy!”The spell hit the skrewt’s armor and rebounded; Harry ducked just in time,
but could smell burning hair; it had singed the top of his head. The skrewt
issued a blast of fire from its end and flew forward toward him.
“Impedimenta!”
 Harry yelled. The spell hit the skrewt’s armor again and
ricocheted off; Harry staggered back a few paces and fell over.
“IMPEDIMENTA!”
The skrewt was inches from him when it froze — he had managed to hit it
on its fleshy, shell-less underside. Panting, Harry pushed himself away from it
and ran, hard, in the opposite direction — the Impediment Curse was not
permanent; the skrewt would be regaining the use of its legs at any moment.
He took a left path and hit a dead end, a right, and hit another; forcin ion, it isagainst nature.”
“But how do you do it?”
“By an act of evil — the supreme act of evil. By committing murder.
Killing rips the soul apart. The wizard intent upon creating a Horcrux would
use the damage to his advantage: He would encase the torn portion —”
“Encase? But how — ?”
“There is a spell, do not ask me, I don’t know!” said Slughorn, shaking his
head like an old elephant bothered by mosquitoes. “Do I look as though I
have tried it — do I look like a killer?”
“No, sir, of course not,” said Riddle quickly. “I’m sorry . . . I didn’t mean to
offend . . .”
“Not at all, not at all, not offended,” said Slughorn gruffly. “It’s natural to
feel some curiosity about these things. . . . Wizards of a certain caliber have
always been drawn to that aspect of magic. . . .”
“Yes, sir,” said Riddle. “What I don’t understand, though — just out of
curiosity — I mean, would one Horcrux be much use? Can you only split
your soul once? Wouldn’t it be better, make you stronger, to have your soul in
more pieces, I mean, ur home from
attack.

dangerous enemy, another to speak of them, as Snape was doing, with aloving caress in his voice?
“Your defenses,” said Snape, a little louder, “must therefore be as flexible
and inventive as the arts you seek to undo. These pictures” — he indicated a
few of them as he swept past — “give a fair representation of what happens to
those who suffer, for instance, the Cruciatus Curse” — he waved a hand
toward a witch who was clearly shrieking in agony — “feel the Dementor’s
Kiss” — a wizard lying huddled and blank-eyed, slumped against a wall —
“or provoke the aggression of the Inferius” — a bloody mass upon the
ground.
“Has an Inferius been seen, then?” said Parvati Patil in a high-pitched
voice. “Is it definite, is he using them?”
“The Dark Lord has used Inferi in the past,” said Snape, “which means you
would be well-advised to assume he might use them again. Now . . .”
He set off again around the other side of the classroom toward his desk, and
again, they watched him as he walked, his dark robes billowing  tant; yet it was almost empty but for a residue of old underwear,
sweets, empty ink bottles, and broken quills that coated the very bottom.
Nearby, on the floor, lay a purple leaflet emblazoned with the words:

“Looks like a really good plan from where I’m standing,” said Harry,
grinning bleakly. “They’ll just have to stand back and let the dragons do their
stuff.”
“Right — these dragons,” said Sirius, speaking very quickly now. “There’s
a way, Harry. Don’t be tempted to try a Stunning Spell — dragons are strong
and too powerfully magical to be knocked out by a single Stunner, you need
about half a dozen wizards at a time to overcome a dragon —”
“Yeah, I know, I just saw,” said Harry.
“But you can do it alone,” said Sirius. “There is a way, and a simple spell’s
all you need. Just —”
But Harry held up a hand to silence him, his heart suddenly pounding as
though it would burst. He could hear footsteps coming down the spiral
staircase behind him.
“Go!” he hissed at Sirius. “
Go!
 There’s someone coming!”Harry scrambled to his feet, hiding the fire — if someone saw Sirius’s face
within the walls of Hogwarts, they would raise an almighty uproar — the

Snape’s back. “Though I would question whether it is advisable to teach them
a potion like the Strengthening Solution. I think the Ministry would prefer it if
that was removed from the syllabus.”
Snape straightened up slowly and turned to look at her.
“Now . . . how long have you been teaching at Hogwarts?” she asked, her
quill poised over her clipboard.
“Fourteen years,” Snape replied. His expression was unfathomable. His
eyes on Snape, Harry added a few drops to his potion; it hissed menacingly
and turned from turquoise to orange.
“You applied first for the Defense Against the Dark Arts post, I believe?”
Professor Umbridge asked Snape.
“Yes,” said Snape quietly.
“But you were unsuccessful?”
Snape’s lip curled.
“Obviously.”
Professor Umbridge scribbled on her clipboard.
“And you have applied regularly for the Defense Against the Dark Arts
post since you first joined the school, I believe?”
“Yes,” said Snape quietly, barely moving his lips. He looked very angry.
“Do you have   Thursday afternoon’s double
Potions lesson loomed nearer, “is a diversion. Then one of us can sneak into
Snape’s office and take what we need.”
Harry and Ron looked at her nervously.
“I think I’d better do the actual stealing,” Hermione continued in a matter-
of-fact tone. “You two will be expelled if you get into any more trouble, and
I’ve got a clean record. So all you need to do is cause enough mayhem to
keep Snape busy for five minutes or so.”
Harry smiled feebly. Deliberately causing mayhem in Snape’s Potions class
was about as safe as poking a sleeping dragon in the eye.
Potions lessons took place in one of the large dungeons. Thursday
afternoon’s lesson proceeded in the usual way. Twenty cauldrons stood
steaming between the wooden desks, on which stood brass scales and jars of
ingredients. Snape prowled through the fumes, making waspish remarks about
the Gryffindors’ work while the Slytherins sniggered appreciatively. Draco
Malfoy, who was Snape’s favorite student, kept flicking puffer-fish eyes at
Ro s lesson, he knew he’d been wrong.
Snape didn’t dislike Harry — he 
hated
 him.
Potions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons. It was colder here
than up in the main castle, and would have been quite creepy enough without
the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls.
Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and like
Flitwick, he paused at Harry’s name.
“Ah, yes,” he said softly, “Harry Potter. Our new — 
celebrity
.”
Draco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behind their
hands. Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class. His eyes
were black like Hagrid’s, but they had none of Hagrid’s warmth. They were
cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels.
“You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potion-making,”
he began. He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but they caught every
word — like Professor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping a class
silent without effort. “As there is little foolish wand-wavin  up a
Love Potion! And while you’re at it, Professor Flitwick knows more about
Entrancing Enchantments than any wizard I’ve ever met, the sly old dog!”
Professor Flitwick buried his face in his hands. Snape was looking as
though the first person to ask him for a Love Potion would be force-fed
poison.
“Please, Hermione, tell me you weren’t one of the forty-six,” said Ron as
they left the Great Hall for their first lesson. Hermione suddenly became very
interested in searching her bag for her schedule and didn’t answer.
All day long, the dwarfs kept barging into their classes to deliver
valentines, to the annoyance of the teachers, and late that afternoon as the
Gryffindors were walking upstairs for Charms, one of the dwarfs caught up
with Harry.
“Oi, you! ’Arry Potter!” shouted a particularly grim-looking dwarf,
elbowing people out of the way to get to Harry.
Hot all over at the thought of being given a valentine in front of a line of
first years, which happened to include Ginny Weasley, Harry tried to escape.
 p of tea with me around three? I want to hear all about your
first week. Send us an answer back with Hedwig.
HagridHarry borrowed Ron’s quill, scribbled 
Yes, please, see you later
 on the back
of the note, and sent Hedwig off again.
It was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to, because the
Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so
far.
At the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the idea that Professor Snape
disliked him. By the end of the first Potions lesson, he knew he’d been wrong.
Snape didn’t dislike Harry — he 
hated
 him.
Potions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons. It was colder here
than up in the main castle, and would have been quite creepy enough without
the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls.
Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and like
Flitwick, he paused at Harry’s name.
“Ah, yes,” he said softly, “Harry Potter. Our new — 
celebrity
.”
Draco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and ly were they studying as though they had exams every day, but the
lessons themselves had become more demanding than ever before. Harry
barely understood half of what Professor McGonagall said to them these days;
even Hermione had had to ask her to repeat instructions once or twice.
Incredibly, and to Hermione’s increasing resentment, Harry’s best subject had
suddenly become Potions, thanks to the Half-Blood Prince.
Nonverbal spells were now expected, not only in Defense Against the Dark
Arts, but in Charms and Transfiguration too. Harry frequently looked over at
his classmates in the common room or at mealtimes to see them purple in the
face and straining as though they had overdosed on U-No-Poo; but he knew
that they were really struggling to make spells work without saying
incantations aloud. It was a relief to get outside into the greenhouses; they
were dealing with more dangerous plants than ever in Herbology, but at least
they were still allowed to swear loudly if the Venomous Tentacula seized

Malfoy, who was Snape’s favorite student, kept flicking puffer-fish eyes at
Ron and Harry, who knew that if they retaliated they would get detention
faster than you could say “Unfair.”
Harry’s Swelling Solution was far too runny, but he had his mind on more
important things. He was waiting for Hermione’s signal, and he hardly
listened as Snape paused to sneer at his watery potion. When Snape turned
and walked off to bully Neville, Hermione caught Harry’s eye and nodded.Harry ducked swiftly down behind his cauldron, pulled one of Fred’s
Filibuster fireworks out of his pocket, and gave We are also looking for new

his big waistcoated belly casting the table below into shadow — “is a former

“Potions?”
“Potions?”
The word echoed all over the Hall as people wondered whether they had
heard right.
“Potions?” said Ron and Hermione together, turning to stare at Harry. “But

“Professor Snape, meanwhile,” said Dumbledore, raising his voice so that it
carried over all the muttering, “will be taking over the position of Defense

“No!” said Harry, so loudly that many heads turned in his direction. He didnot care; he was staring up at the staff table, incensed. How could Snape be

ife at the Burrow was as different as possible from life on Privet Drive.
The Dursleys liked everything neat and ordered; the Weasleys’ house
burst with the strange and unexpected. Harry got a shock the first time he
looked in the mirror over the kitchen mantelpiece and it shouted,
“Tuck your
shirt in, scruffy!”
 The ghoul in the attic howled and dropped pipes whenever
he felt things were getting too quiet, and small explosions from Fred and
George’s bedroom were considered perfectly normal. What Harry found most
unusual about life at Ron’s, however, wasn’t the talking mirror or the clanking
ghoul: It was the fact that everybody there seemed to like him.
Mrs. Weasley fussed over the state of his socks and tried to force him to eat
fourth helpings at every meal. Mr. Weasley liked Harry to sit next to him at
the dinner table so that he could bombard him with questions about life with
Muggles  me 
what,
 Arthur?” Mrs. Weasley repeated, in a dangerous sort of
voice.
“It’s nothing, Molly,” mumbled Mr. Weasley, “Fred and George just — but
I’ve had words with them —”
“What have they done this time?” said Mrs. Weasley. “If it’s got anything
to do with Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes —”
“Why don’t you show Harry where he’s sleeping, Ron?” said Hermione
from the doorway.
“He knows where he’s sleeping,” said Ron, “in my room, he slept there last
—”“We can all go,” said Hermione pointedly.
“Oh,” said Ron, cottoning on. “Right.”
“Yeah, we’ll come too,” said George.
“You stay where you are!”
 snarled Mrs. Weasley.
Harry and Ron edged out of the kitchen, and they, Hermione, and Ginny set
off along the narrow hallway and up the rickety staircase that zigzagged
through the house to the upper stories.
“What are Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes?” Harry asked as they climbed.
Ron and Ginny both laughed, although Hermione didn’t.
“Mum found this stack of order forms when she was cleaning Fred and
George’s room,” said Ron quietly.  Slytherins all sing:
Weasley is our King.
 
Weasley was born in a bin,
He always lets the Quaffle in,
Weasley will make sure we win,
Weasley is our King.
 
“— and Alicia passes back to Angelina!” Lee shouted, and as Harry
swerved, his insides boiling at what he had just heard, he knew Lee was
trying to drown out the sound of the singing. “Come on now, Angelina —
looks like she’s got just the Keeper to beat! — SHE SHOOTS — SHE —
aaaah . . .”
Bletchley, the Slytherin Keeper, had saved the goal; he threw the Quaffle to
Warrington who sped off with it, zigzagging in between Alicia and Katie; the
singing from below grew louder and louder as he drew nearer and nearer Ron—
 
Weasley is our King,
Weasley is our King,
He always lets the Quaffle in,
Weasley is our King.
 
Harry could not help himself: Abandoning his search for the Snitch, he
turned his Firebolt toward Ron, a lone figure at the far end of the pitch,
hovering before the three goal hoops while the massive Warrington pelted
toward him . . .
“— and it’s Wa ,” Vernon Dursley said now, resuming his pacing up and
down the living room, “we — Petunia, Dudley, and I — are in danger. From
— from —”
“Some of ‘my lot,’ right,” said Harry.
“Well, I don’t believe it,” repeated Uncle Vernon, coming to a halt in front
of Harry again. “I was awake half the night thinking it all over, and I believe
it’s a plot to get the house.”
“The house?” repeated Harry. “What house?”
“
This 
house!” shrieked Uncle Vernon, the vein in his forehead starting to
pulse. “
Our
 house! House prices are skyrocketing around here! You want us
out of the way and then you’re going to do a bit of hocus-pocus and before weknow it the deeds will be in your name and —”
“Are you out of your mind?” demanded Harry. “A plot to get this house?
Are you actually as stupid as you look?”
“Don’t you dare — !” squealed Aunt Petunia, but again, Vernon waved her
down: Slights on his personal appearance were, it seemed, as nothing to the
danger he had spotted.
“Just in case you’ve forgotten,” said Harry, “I’ve already ning on. “Right.”
“Yeah, we’ll come too,” said George.
“You stay where you are!”
 snarled Mrs. Weasley.
Harry and Ron edged out of the kitchen, and they, Hermione, and Ginny set
off along the narrow hallway and up the rickety staircase that zigzagged
through the house to the upper stories.
“What are Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes?” Harry asked as they climbed.
Ron and Ginny both laughed, although Hermione didn’t.
“Mum found this stack of order forms when she was cleaning Fred and
George’s room,” said Ron quietly. “Great long price lists for stuff they’ve
invented. Joke stuff, you know. Fake wands and trick sweets, loads of stuff. It
was brilliant, I never knew they’d been inventing all that . . .”
“We’ve been hearing explosions out of their room for ages, but we never
thought they were actually 
making
 things,” said Ginny. “We thought they just
liked the noise.”
“Only, most of the stuff — well, all of it, really — was a bit dangerous,”
said Ron, “and, you know, they were planning to sell it at Hogwarts to make

Percy, and the girls. Within five minutes, he was back in the kitchen, his robes
on the right way now, dragging a comb through his hair.
“I’d better hurry — you have a good term, boys,” said Mr. Weasley to
Harry, Ron, and the twins, fastening a cloak over his shoulders and preparing
to Disapparate. “Molly, are you going to be all right taking the kids to King’s
Cross?”
“Of course I will,” she said. “You just look after Mad-Eye, we’ll be fine.”
As Mr. Weasley vanished, Bill and Charlie entered the kitchen.
“Did someone say Mad-Eye?” Bill asked. “What’s he been up to now?”
“He says someone tried to break into his house last night,” said Mrs.
Weasley.
“Mad-Eye Moody?” said George thoughtfully, spreading marmalade on histoast. “Isn’t he that nutter —”
“Your father thinks very highly of Mad-Eye Moody,” said Mrs. Weasley
sternly.
“Yeah, well, Dad collects plugs, doesn’t he?” said Fred quietly as Mrs.
Weasley left the room. “Birds of a feather . . .”
“Moo . Weasley’s
voice to permeate the room better. “It makes such a nice change.”
“— COMPLETELY IRRESPONSIBLE, AS IF WE HAVEN’T GOT
ENOUGH TO WORRY ABOUT WITHOUT YOU DRAGGING STOLEN
CAULDRONS INTO THE HOUSE —”
“The idiots are letting her get into her stride,” said George, shaking his
head. “You’ve got to head her off early, otherwise she builds up a head ofsteam and goes on for hours. And she’s been dying to have a go at
Mundungus ever since he sneaked off when he was supposed to be following
you, Harry — and there goes Sirius’s mum again —”
Mrs. Weasley’s voice was lost amid fresh shrieks and screams from the
portraits in the hall. George made to shut the door to drown the noise, but
before he could do so, a house-elf edged into the room.
Except for the filthy rag tied like a loincloth around its middle, it was
completely naked. It looked very old. Its skin seemed to be several times too
big for it and though it was bald like all house-elves, there was a quantity of
white hair growing out of its large, batlike e elves. All of them had
the same rather snoutlike nose.
Harry’s bewilderment deepened with every step he took. What on earth
were they doing in a house that looked as though it belonged to the Darkest of
wizards?
“Mrs. Weasley, why — ?”“Ron and Hermione will explain everything, dear, I’ve really got to dash,”
Mrs. Weasley whispered distractedly. “There” — they had reached the second
landing — “you’re the door on the right. I’ll call you when it’s over.”
And she hurried off downstairs again.
Harry crossed the dingy landing, turned the bedroom doorknob, which was
shaped like a serpent’s head, and opened the door.
He caught a brief glimpse of a gloomy high-ceilinged, twin-bedded room,
then there was a loud twittering noise, followed by an even louder shriek, and
his vision was completely obscured by a large quantity of very bushy hair —
Hermione had thrown herself onto him in a hug that nearly knocked him flat,
while Ron’s tiny owl, Pigwidgeon, zoomed excitedly round and round their
heads.

And he knew by her tone that it was his mother and father this time: He
moved toward her, feeling as if something heavy were pressing on his chest,
the same sensation he had had right after Dumbledore had died, a grief that
had actually weighed on his heart and lungs.
The headstone was only two rows behind Kendra and Ariana’s. It was
made of white marble, just like Dumbledore’s tomb, and this made it easy to
read, as it seemed to shine in the dark. Harry did not need to kneel or even
approach very close to it to make out the words engraved upon it.

“We are pleased to welcome a new member of staff this year. Professor
Slughorn” — Slughorn stood up, his bald head gleaming in the candlelight,
his big waistcoated belly casting the table below into shadow — “is a former
colleague of mine who has agreed to resume his old post of Potions master.”
“Potions?”
“Potions?”
The word echoed all over the Hall as people wondered whether they had
heard right.
“Potions?” said Ron and Hermione together, turning to stare at Harry. “But
you said —”
“Professor Snape, meanwhile,” said Dumbledore, raising his voice so that it
carried over all the muttering, “will be taking over the position of Defense
Against the Dark Arts teacher.”
“No!” said Harry, so loudly that many heads turned in his direction. He didnot care; he was staring up at the staff table, incensed. How could Snape be
given the Defense Against the Dark Arts job after all this time? Hadn’t it been

hair. And we’ve got all our books —” He pointed at a large bag under his
chair. “What about those 
Monster Books
, eh? The assistant nearly cried when
we said we wanted two.”
“What’s all that, Hermione?” Harry asked, pointing at not one but three
bulging bags in the chair next to her.
“Well, I’m taking more new subjects than you, aren’t I?” said Hermione.
“Those are my books for Arithmancy, Care of Magical Creatures, Divination,
Study of Ancient Runes, Muggle Studies —”
“What are you doing Muggle Studies for?” said Ron, rolling his eyes at
Harry. “You’re Muggle-born! Your mum and dad are Muggles! You already
know all about Muggles!”
“But it’ll be fascinating to study them from the Wizarding point of view,”
said Hermione earnestly.
“Are you planning to eat or sleep at all this year, Hermione?” asked Harry,
while Ron sniggered. Hermione ignored them.
“I’ve still got ten Galleons,” she said, checking her purse. “It’s my birthday

What platform do students use to board the Hogwarts Express?,Platform 9 3/4,"According to the passage, students use platform nine and three-quarters to board the Hogwarts Express."," ten. The only tricky part was doing this in an
unobtrusive way, so as to avoid attracting Muggle attention. They did it in
groups today; Harry, Ron, and Hermione (the most conspicuous, since they
were accompanied by Pigwidgeon and Crookshanks) went first; they leaned
casually against the barrier, chatting unconcernedly, and slid sideways
through it . . . and as they did so, platform nine and three-quarters
materialized in front of them.
The Hogwarts Express, a gleaming scarlet steam engine, was already there,
clouds of steam billowing from it, through which the many Hogwarts students
and parents on the platform appeared like dark ghosts. Pigwidgeon became
noisier than ever in response to the hooting of many owls through the mist.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione set off to find seats, and were soon stowing their
luggage in a compartment halfway along the train. They then hopped back
down onto the platform to say good-bye to Mrs. Weasley, Bill, and Charlie.
“I might be seeing you all sooner than you think,” said Char ough onto
platform nine and three quarters, where the Hogwarts Express stood belching
sooty steam over a platform packed with departing students and their families.Harry inhaled the familiar smell and felt his spirits soar. . . . He was really
going back. . . .
“I hope the others make it in time,” said Mrs. Weasley anxiously, staring
behind her at the wrought-iron arch spanning the platform, through which
new arrivals would come.
“Nice dog, Harry!” called a tall boy with dreadlocks.
“Thanks, Lee,” said Harry, grinning, as Sirius wagged his tail frantically.
“Oh good,” said Mrs. Weasley, sounding relieved, “here’s Alastor with the
luggage, look . . .”
A porter’s cap pulled low over his mismatched eyes, Moody came limping
through the archway pushing a cart full of their trunks.
“All okay,” he muttered to Mrs. Weasley and Tonks. “Don’t think we were
followed . . .”
Seconds later, Mr. Weasley emerged onto the platform with Ron and
Hermione. They had almost unloaded Moody’s luggage cart when Fred,
George, and Ginn  back to us.”
They looked around. People were still watching them, mainly because of
Hedwig’s continuing screeches.
“I think we’d better go and wait by the car,” said Harry. “We’re attracting
too much atten —”
“Harry!” said Ron, his eyes gleaming. “The car!”
“What about it?”
“We can fly the car to Hogwarts!”
“But I thought —”
“We’re stuck, right? And we’ve got to get to school, haven’t we? And even
underage wizards are allowed to use magic if it’s a real emergency, section
nineteen or something of the Restriction of Thingy —”
“But your mum and dad . . .” said Harry, pushing against the barrier again
in the vain hope that it would give way. “How will they get home?”
“They don’t need the car!” said Ron impatiently. “They know how toApparate! You know, just vanish and reappear at home! They only bother
with Floo powder and the car because we’re all underage and we’re not
allowed to Apparate yet. . . .”
Harry’s feeling of panic turned suddenly to excitement.
“Can you fly it?”
“No problem,” said Ron, wheeling his  took quite a while to
recover from the fireworks, and by the time they entered London, Harry, Ron,
and Hermione were all severely scratched. They were very relieved to get out
at King’s Cross, even though the rain was coming down harder than ever, and
they got soaked carrying their trunks across the busy road and into the station.
Harry was used to getting onto platform nine and three-quarters by now. It
was a simple matter of walking straight through the apparently solid barrier
dividing platforms nine and ten. The only tricky part was doing this in an
unobtrusive way, so as to avoid attracting Muggle attention. They did it in
groups today; Harry, Ron, and Hermione (the most conspicuous, since they
were accompanied by Pigwidgeon and Crookshanks) went first; they leaned
casually against the barrier, chatting unconcernedly, and slid sideways
through it . . . and as they did so, platform nine and three-quarters
materialized in front of them.
The Hogwarts Express, a gleaming scarlet steam engine, was already the  that it was rather thicker than usual, Harry slit open the envelope,
pulled out the first page of parchment within, and read:
Dear Mr. Potter,
Please note that the new school year will begin on September the first.
The Hogwarts Express will leave from King’s Cross station, platform
nine and three-quarters, at eleven o’clock.
Third years are permitted to visit the village of Hogsmeade on certain
weekends. Please give the enclosed permission form to your parent or
guardian to sign.A list of books for next year is enclosed.
Yours sincerely,
Deputy Headmistress
Harry pulled out the Hogsmeade permission form and looked at it, no
longer grinning. It would be wonderful to visit Hogsmeade on weekends; he
knew it was an entirely wizarding village, and he had never set foot there. But
how on earth was he going to persuade Uncle Vernon or Aunt Petunia to sign
the form?
He looked over at the alarm clock. It was now two o’clock in the morning.
Deciding that he’d worry about the Hogsmeade form when he woke up,
Harry got b urn up at the World Cup, and of
course, we just haven’t got a magical site big enough to accommodate them
all. There are places Muggles can’t penetrate, but imagine trying to pack a
hundred thousand wizards into Diagon Alley or platform nine and three-
quarters. So we had to find a nice deserted moor, and set up as many anti-
Muggle precautions as possible. The whole Ministry’s been working on it for
months. First, of course, we have to stagger the arrivals. People with cheaper
tickets have to arrive two weeks beforehand. A limited number use Muggle
transport, but we can’t have too many clogging up their buses and trains —
remember, wizards are coming from all over the world. Some Apparate, of
course, but we have to set up safe points for them to appear, well away from
Muggles. I believe there’s a handy wood they’re using as the Apparition
point. For those who don’t want to Apparate, or can’t, we use Portkeys.
They’re objects that are used to transport wizards from one spot to another at
a prearranged time. Y and all too soon, the Hogwarts
Express was pulling in at platform nine and three-quarters. The usual
confusion and noise filled the corridors as the students began to disembark.Ron and Hermione struggled out past Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, carrying
their trunks. Harry, however, stayed put.
“Fred — George — wait a moment.”
The twins turned. Harry pulled open his trunk and drew out his Triwizard
winnings.
“Take it,” he said, and he thrust the sack into George’s hands.
“What?” said Fred, looking flabbergasted.
“Take it,” Harry repeated firmly. “I don’t want it.”
“You’re mental,” said George, trying to push it back at Harry.
“No, I’m not,” said Harry. “You take it, and get inventing. It’s for the joke
shop.”
“He 
is
 mental,” Fred said in an almost awed voice.
“Listen,” said Harry firmly. “If you don’t take it, I’m throwing it down the
drain. I don’t want it and I don’t need it. But I could do with a few laughs. We
could all do with a few laughs. I’ve got a feeling we’re going to need them
more than usual before   any more about trying to enter?”
“I asked McGonagall how the champions are chosen but she wasn’t
telling,” said George bitterly. “She just told me to shut up and get on with
Transfiguring my raccoon.”“Wonder what the tasks are going to be?” said Ron thoughtfully. “You
know, I bet we could do them, Harry. We’ve done dangerous stuff before. . . .”
“Not in front of a panel of judges, you haven’t,” said Fred. “McGonagall
says the champions get awarded points according to how well they’ve done
the tasks.”
“Who are the judges?” Harry asked.
“Well, the Heads of the participating schools are always on the panel,” said
Hermione, and everyone looked around at her, rather surprised, “because all
three of them were injured during the Tournament of 1792, when a cockatrice
the champions were supposed to be catching went on the rampage.”
She noticed them all looking at her and said, with her usual air of
impatience that nobody else had read all the books she had, “It’s all in
Hogwarts: A History.
 Though, of course, that b"
What is the name of Harry's godfather?,Sirius Black,The name of Harry's godfather is Sirius Black.," Harry bid him
and Hermione good-bye, then wheeled the trolley bearing his trunk and
Hedwig’s cage toward Uncle Vernon, who greeted him in his usual fashion.
“What’s that?” he snarled, staring at the envelope Harry was still clutching
in his hand. “If it’s another form for me to sign, you’ve got another —”
“It’s not,” said Harry cheerfully. “It’s a letter from my godfather.”
“Godfather?” spluttered Uncle Vernon. “You haven’t got a godfather!”
“Yes, I have,” said Harry brightly. “He was my mum and dad’s best friend.
He’s a convicted murderer, but he’s broken out of Wizard prison and he’s on
the run. He likes to keep in touch with me, though . . . keep up with my
news . . . check if I’m happy. . . .”
And, grinning broadly at the look of horror on Uncle Vernon’s face, Harry
set off toward the station exit, Hedwig rattling along in front of him, for what
looked like a much better summer than the last.

into his previously despised mother’s family — the woman whom, you will
remember, he had thought could not be a witch if she had succumbed to the
shameful human weakness of death.
“All he had to go upon was the single name ‘Marvolo,’ which he knew
from those who ran the orphanage had been his mother’s father’s name.
Finally, after painstaking research through old books of Wizarding families,
he discovered the existence of Slytherin’s surviving line. In the summer of his
sixteenth year, he left the orphanage to which he returned annually and set off
to find his Gaunt relatives. And now, Harry, if you will stand . . .”
Dumbledore rose, and Harry saw that he was again holding a small crystal
bottle filled with swirling, pearly memory.
“I was very lucky to collect this,” he said, as he poured the gleaming mass
into the Pensieve. “As you will understand when we have experienced it.
Shall we?”
Harry stepped up to the stone basin and bowed obediently until his face
sank through the surface of th Harry. But you see what they’re doing? They want to turn you into someone
nobody will believe. Fudge is behind it, I’ll bet anything. They want wizards
on the street to think you’re just some stupid boy who’s a bit of a joke, who
tells ridiculous tall stories because he loves being famous and wants to keep it
going.”“I didn’t ask — I didn’t want — 
Voldemort killed my parents!
” Harry
spluttered. “I got famous because he murdered my family but couldn’t kill
me! Who wants to be famous for that? Don’t they think I’d rather it’d never
—”
“We 
know,
 Harry,” said Ginny earnestly.
“And of course, they didn’t report a word about the dementors attacking
you,” said Hermione. “Someone’s told them to keep that quiet. That
should’ve been a really big story, out-of-control dementors. They haven’t
even reported that you broke the International Statute of Secrecy — we
thought they would, it would tie in so well with this image of you as some
stupid show-off — we think they’re biding their time until you’re expelled,
then t s about He-Who-Must-Not-Be-
Named?” Rita asked Hermione in a hushed voice.
“Yes, I do,” said Hermione. “The true story. All the facts. Exactly as Harry
reports them. He’ll give you all the details, he’ll tell you the names of the
undiscovered Death Eaters he saw there, he’ll tell you what Voldemort looks
like now — oh, get a grip on yourself,” she added contemptuously, throwing a
napkin across the table, for at the sound of Voldemort’s name, Rita had
jumped so badly that she had slopped half her glass of firewhisky down
herself.
Rita blotted the front of her grubby raincoat, still staring at Hermione. Then
she said baldly, “The 
Prophet 
wouldn’t print it. In case you haven’t noticed,
nobody believes his cock-and-bull story. Everyone thinks he’s delusional.
Now, if you let me write the story from that angle —”
“We don’t need another story about how Harry’s lost his marbles!” said
Hermione angrily. “We’ve had plenty of those already, thank you! I want him
given the opportunity to tell the truth!”
“There’s no m  back, the better to look at
Harry.
“Black woz a big supporter of You-Know-’Oo,” he said.
“What, Voldemort?” said Harry, without thinking.
Even Stan’s pimples went white; Ern jerked the steering wheel so hard that
a whole farmhouse had to jump aside to avoid the bus.
“You outta your tree?” yelped Stan. “’Choo say ’is name for?”
“Sorry,” said Harry hastily. “Sorry, I — I forgot —”
“Forgot!” said Stan weakly. “Blimey, my ’eart’s goin’ that fast . . .”
“So — so Black was a supporter of You-Know-Who?” Harry prompted
apologetically.
“Yeah,” said Stan, still rubbing his chest. “Yeah, that’s right. Very close toYou-Know-’Oo, they say. Anyway, when little ’Arry Potter got the better of
You-Know-’Oo —”
Harry nervously flattened his bangs down again.
“— all You-Know-’Oo’s supporters was tracked down, wasn’t they, Ern?
Most of ’em knew it was all over, wiv You-Know-’Oo gone, and they came
quiet. But not Sirius Black. I ’eard he thought ’e’d be second-in-command
once You-Know-’Oo ’ad taken over.
“Anyway, they cornered Bl ’s boss!” Ron breathed. “Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of
Magic!”
Harry elbowed Ron hard to make him shut up.
Hagrid had gone pale and sweaty. He dropped into one of his chairs and
looked from Dumbledore to Cornelius Fudge.“Bad business, Hagrid,” said Fudge in rather clipped tones. “Very bad
business. Had to come. Four attacks on Muggle-borns. Things’ve gone far
enough. Ministry’s got to act.”
“I never,” said Hagrid, looking imploringly at Dumbledore. “You know I
never, Professor Dumbledore, sir —”
“I want it understood, Cornelius, that Hagrid has my full confidence,” said
Dumbledore, frowning at Fudge.
“Look, Albus,” said Fudge, uncomfortably. “Hagrid’s record’s against him.
Ministry’s got to do something — the school governors have been in touch
—”
“Yet again, Cornelius, I tell you that taking Hagrid away will not help in
the slightest,” said Dumbledore. His blue eyes were full of a fire Harry had
never seen before.
“Look at it from my point of view,” said Fudge, fidgeting with his bowler.
“I’m under a lot  get who I’ve got with me.”
“Tie that around the bars,” said Fred, throwing the end of a rope to Harry.
“If the Dursleys wake up, I’m dead,” said Harry as he tied the rope tightly
around a bar and Fred revved up the car.
“Don’t worry,” said Fred, “and stand back.”
Harry moved back into the shadows next to Hedwig, who seemed to have
realized how important this was and kept still and silent. The car revved
louder and louder and suddenly, with a crunching noise, the bars were pulled
clean out of the window as Fred drove straight up in the air. Harry ran back to
the window to see the bars dangling a few feet above the ground. Panting,
Ron hoisted them up into the car. Harry listened anxiously, but there was no
sound from the Dursleys’ bedroom.
When the bars were safely in the back seat with Ron, Fred reversed as close
as possible to Harry’s window.
“Get in,” Ron said.
“But all my Hogwarts stuff — my wand — my broomstick —”
“Where is it?”
“Locked in the cupboard under the stairs, and I can’t get out of this room
—” I owe you another explanation, Harry,” said Dumbledore hesitantly.
“You may, perhaps, have wondered why I never chose you as a prefect? I
must confess . . . that I rather thought . . . you had enough responsibility to be
going on with.”
Harry looked up at him and saw a tear trickling down Dumbledore’s face
into his long silver beard. 
CHAPTER  THIRTY-EIGHT
THE SECOND WAR BEGINS
 
HE-WHO-MUST-NOT-BE-NAMED RETURNS
In a brief statement Friday night, Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge
confirmed that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named has returned to this
country and is active once more.
“It is with great regret that I must confirm that the wizard styling
himself Lord — well, you know who I mean — is alive and among us
again,” said Fudge, looking tired and flustered as he addressed reporters.
“It is with almost equal regret that we report the mass revolt of the
dementors of Azkaban, who have shown themselves averse to continuing
in the Ministry’s employ. We believe that the dementors are currently
taking direction from Lord "
Who is the gamekeeper at Hogwarts?,Rubeus Hagrid,The gamekeeper at Hogwarts is Rubeus Hagrid.,"s. One of Harry’s most prized
possessions was his Nimbus Two Thousand racing broom.
Harry put the leather case aside and picked up his last parcel. He
recognized the untidy scrawl on the brown paper at once: This was from
Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper. He tore off the top layer of paper and
glimpsed something green and leathery, but before he could unwrap it
properly, the parcel gave a strange quiver, and whatever was inside it snapped
loudly — as though it had jaws.
Harry froze. He knew that Hagrid would never send him anything
dangerous on purpose, but then, Hagrid didn’t have a normal person’s view of
what was dangerous. Hagrid had been known to befriend giant spiders, buy
vicious, three-headed dogs from men in pubs, and sneak illegal dragon eggs
into his cabin.
Harry poked the parcel nervously. It snapped loudly again. Harry reached
for the lamp on his bedside table, gripped it firmly in one hand, and raised it
over his head, ready to strike. Then he seized the rest of the wrapping paper in
his other ha unfolded it, and read it, with Ron,
Seamus, Dean, and Neville looking over his shoulder. It was an article topped
with a picture of Hagrid looking extremely shifty.
DUMBLEDORE’S GIANT MISTAKE
Albus Dumbledore, eccentric headmaster of Hogwarts School of
Witchcraft and Wizardry, has never been afraid to make
controversial staff appointments, 
writes Rita Skeeter, Special
Correspondent.
 In September of this year, he hired Alastor “Mad-
Eye” Moody, the notoriously jinx-happy ex-Auror, to teach Defense
Against the Dark Arts, a decision that caused many raised eyebrows
at the Ministry of Magic, given Moody’s well-known habit of
attacking anybody who makes a sudden movement in his presence.
Mad-Eye Moody, however, looks responsible and kindly when set
beside the part-human Dumbledore employs to teach Care ofMagical Creatures.
Rubeus Hagrid, who admits to being expelled from Hogwarts in
his third year, has enjoyed the position of gamekeeper at the school
ever since, a job secured for him by Dumbledore. Last year,
ho h-Finish Handle Polish, a pair of
gleaming silver Tail-Twig Clippers, a tiny brass compass to clip on yourbroom for long journeys, and a 
Handbook of Do-It-Yourself Broomcare.
Apart from his friends, the thing that Harry missed most about Hogwarts
was Quidditch, the most popular sport in the magical world — highly
dangerous, very exciting, and played on broomsticks. Harry happened to be a
very good Quidditch player; he had been the youngest person in a century to
be picked for one of the Hogwarts House teams. One of Harry’s most prized
possessions was his Nimbus Two Thousand racing broom.
Harry put the leather case aside and picked up his last parcel. He
recognized the untidy scrawl on the brown paper at once: This was from
Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper. He tore off the top layer of paper and
glimpsed something green and leathery, but before he could unwrap it
properly, the parcel gave a strange quiver, and whatever was inside it snapped
loudly — as though it had jaws.
Harry froze. He knew that Hagrid would eart
leapt. There were no Aurors waiting outside the inn, but instead the gigantic,
black-bearded form of Rubeus Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper, wearing a
long beaverskin coat, beaming at the sight of Harry’s face and oblivious to the
startled stares of passing Muggles.“Harry!” he boomed, sweeping Harry into a bone-crushing hug the moment
Harry had stepped out of the car. “Buckbeak — Witherwings, I mean — yeh
should see him, Harry, he’s so happy ter be back in the open air —”
“Glad he’s pleased,” said Harry, grinning as he massaged his ribs. “We
didn’t know ‘security’ meant you!”
“I know, jus’ like old times, innit? See, the Ministry wanted ter send a
bunch o’ Aurors, but Dumbledore said I’d do,” said Hagrid proudly, throwing
out his chest and tucking his thumbs into his pockets. “Let’s get goin’ then —
after yeh, Molly, Arthur —”
The Leaky Cauldron was, for the first time in Harry’s memory, completely
empty. Only Tom the landlord, wizened and toothless, remained of the old
crowd. He looked up hopefully as t keeper duties on the grounds, and Professor Grubbly-Plank
continued to take the Care of Magical Creatures classes. Malfoy was gloating
at every possible opportunity.
“Missing your half-breed pal?” he kept whispering to Harry whenever there
was a teacher around, so that he was safe from Harry’s retaliation. “Missing
the elephant-man?”
There was a Hogsmeade visit halfway through January. Hermione was very
surprised that Harry was going to go.
“I just thought you’d want to take advantage of the common room being
quiet,” she said. “Really get to work on that egg.”
“Oh I — I reckon I’ve got a pretty good idea what it’s about now,” Harry
lied.
“Have you really?” said Hermione, looking impressed. “Well done!”
Harry’s insides gave a guilty squirm, but he ignored them. He still had five
weeks to work out that egg clue, after all, and that was ages . . . whereas if he
went into Hogsmeade, he might run into Hagrid, and get a chance to persuade
him to come back.
He, Ron, and Hermione left the castle together on Saturday  hose friends of Harry Potter’s who are
suffering for their allegiance?” Lee was saying.
“Well, as regular listeners will know, several of the more outspoken
supporters of Harry Potter have now been imprisoned, including Xenophilius
Lovegood, erstwhile editor of 
The Quibbler
,” said Lupin.
“At least he’s still alive!” muttered Ron.
“We have also heard within the last few hours that Rubeus Hagrid” — all
three of them gasped, and so nearly missed the rest of the sentence — “well-
known gamekeeper at Hogwarts School, has narrowly escaped arrest within
the grounds of Hogwarts, where he is rumored to have hosted a ‘Support

“I suppose it helps, when escaping from Death Eaters, if you’ve got a
sixteen-foot-high half brother?” asked Lee.
“It would tend to give you an edge,” agreed Lupin gravely. “May I just add

she must have attempted a Hair-Thickening Charm on herself and refused to
listen to the fourteen eyewitnesses who insisted that they had seen the
Slytherin Keeper, Miles Bletchley, hit her from behind with a jinx while she
worked in the library.
Harry felt optimistic about Gryffindor’s chances; they had, after all, never
lost to Malfoy’s team. Admittedly Ron was still not performing to Wood’s
standard, but he was working extremely hard to improve. His greatest
weakness was a tendency to lose confidence when he made a blunder; if he let
in one goal he became flustered and was therefore likely to miss more. On the
other hand, Harry had seen Ron make some truly spectacular saves when he
was on form: During one memorable practice, he had hung one-handed from
his broom and kicked the Quaffle so hard away from the goal hoop that it
soared the length of the pitch and through the center hoop at the other end.
The rest of the team felt this save compare eaters on each team
who carry clubs to beat the Bludgers away from their side. Fred and George
Weasley are the Gryffindor Beaters.”
“And what are the other balls for?” Colin asked, tripping down a couple of
steps because he was gazing open-mouthed at Harry.
“Well, the Quaffle — that’s the biggish red one — is the one that scores
goals. Three Chasers on each team throw the Quaffle to each other and try
and get it through the goalposts at the end of the pitch — they’re three long
poles with hoops on the end.”
“And the fourth ball —”
“— is the Golden Snitch,” said Harry, “and it’s very small, very fast, and
difficult to catch. But that’s what the Seeker’s got to do, because a game of
Quidditch doesn’t end until the Snitch has been caught. And whichever
team’s Seeker gets the Snitch earns his team an extra hundred and fifty
points.”“And 
you’re
 the Gryffindor Seeker, aren’t you?” said Colin in awe.
“Yes,” said Harry as they left the castle and started across the dew-
drenched grass. “And there’s the Keeper, too."
What position does Harry play on his Quidditch team?,Seeker,"According to the text, Harry plays the position of Chaser on the Quidditch team.","ay on the Quidditch team . . .”
“Yeah, that’s right,” said Ron in a heartened tone. “And we 
have 
got plenty
of time to do it all . . .”
Harry glanced over to his right as they approached the Quidditch pitch, to
where the trees of the Forbidden Forest were swaying darkly. Nothing flew
out of them; the sky was empty but for a few distant owls fluttering around
the Owlery Tower. He had enough to worry about; the flying horse wasn’t
doing him any harm: He pushed it out of his mind.
They collected balls from the cupboard in the changing room and set to
work, Ron guarding the three tall goalposts, Harry playing Chaser and trying
to get the Quaffle past Ron. Harry thought Ron was pretty good; he blocked
three-quarters of the goals Harry attempted to put past him and played better
the longer they practiced. After a couple of hours they returned to the school,
where they ate lunch, during which Hermione made it quite clear that she
thought they were irresponsible, then returned to the Quidditch pitch for the
real tr sed. Ron
doesn’t seem too happy about it.
Harry laughed as he put Hermione’s letter aside and picked up her present.
It was very heavy. Knowing Hermione, he was sure it would be a large book
full of very difficult spells — but it wasn’t. His heart gave a huge bound as he
ripped back the paper and saw a sleek black leather case, with silver words
stamped across it, reading 
Broomstick Servicing Kit
.
“Wow, Hermione!” Harry whispered, unzipping the case to look inside.
There was a large jar of Fleetwood’s High-Finish Handle Polish, a pair of
gleaming silver Tail-Twig Clippers, a tiny brass compass to clip on yourbroom for long journeys, and a 
Handbook of Do-It-Yourself Broomcare.
Apart from his friends, the thing that Harry missed most about Hogwarts
was Quidditch, the most popular sport in the magical world — highly
dangerous, very exciting, and played on broomsticks. Harry happened to be a
very good Quidditch player; he had been the youngest person in a century to
be picked for one of the Hogwarts House team on. At either end of the field were
three golden poles with hoops on the end. They reminded Harry of the little
plastic sticks Muggle children blew bubbles through, except that they were
fifty feet high.
Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry mounted his broomstick and
kicked off from the ground. What a feeling — he swooped in and out of the
goalposts and then sped up and down the field. The Nimbus Two Thousand
turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch.
“Hey, Potter, come down!”
Oliver Wood had arrived. He was carrying a large wooden crate under his
arm. Harry landed next to him.
“Very nice,” said Wood, his eyes glinting. “I see what McGonagall
meant . . . you really are a natural. I’m just going to teach you the rules this
evening, then you’ll be joining team practice three times a week.”
He opened the crate. Inside were four different-sized balls.
“Right,” said Wood. “Now, Quidditch is easy enough to understand, even if
it’s not too easy to play. There are seven players on each side. Three of  , but he had another reason for not
wanting Snape near him while he was playing Quidditch. . . .
The rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of
practice, but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common room,
where he found Ron and Hermione playing chess. Chess was the only thing
Hermione ever lost at, something Harry and Ron thought was very good for
her.
“Don’t talk to me for a moment,” said Ron when Harry sat down next to
him, “I need to concen —” He caught sight of Harry’s face. “What’s the
matter with you? You look terrible.”
Speaking quietly so that no one else would hear, Harry told the other two
about Snape’s sudden, sinister desire to be a Quidditch referee.
“Don’t play,” said Hermione at once.“Say you’re ill,” said Ron.
“Pretend to break your leg,” Hermione suggested.
“
Really
 break your leg,” said Ron.
“I can’t,” said Harry. “There isn’t a reserve Seeker. If I back out, Gryffindor
can’t play at all.”
At that moment Neville toppled into the common room. How he h  distant chair. A closer look
showed him that it was Cormac McLaggen.
“I’ve been waiting for you to come back,” said McLaggen, disregarding
Harry’s drawn wand. “Must’ve fallen asleep. Look, I saw them taking
Weasley up to the hospital wing earlier. Didn’t look like he’ll be fit for next
week’s match.”
It took Harry a few moments to realize what McLaggen was talking about.
“Oh . . . right . . . Quidditch,” he said, putting his wand back into the belt of
his jeans and running a hand wearily through his hair. “Yeah . . . he might not
make it.”
“Well, then, I’ll be playing Keeper, won’t I?” said McLaggen.
“Yeah,” said Harry. “Yeah, I suppose so. . . .”
He could not think of an argument against it; after all, McLaggen had
certainly performed second-best in the trials.
“Excellent,” said McLaggen in a satisfied voice. “So when’s practice?”
“What? Oh . . . there’s one tomorrow evening.”“Good. Listen, Potter, we should have a talk beforehand. I’ve got some
ideas on strategy you might find useful.”
“Right,” said Harry  at’s your Quidditch team?” Ron asked.“Er — I don’t know any,” Harry confessed.
“What!” Ron looked dumbfounded. “Oh, you wait, it’s the best game in the
world —” And he was off, explaining all about the four balls and the
positions of the seven players, describing famous games he’d been to with his
brothers and the broomstick he’d like to get if he had the money. He was just
taking Harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door
slid open yet again, but it wasn’t Neville the toadless boy, or Hermione
Granger this time.
Three boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle one at once: It was
the pale boy from Madam Malkin’s robe shop. He was looking at Harry with
a lot more interest than he’d shown back in Diagon Alley.
“Is it true?” he said. “They’re saying all down the train that Harry Potter’s
in this compartment. So it’s you, is it?”
“Yes,” said Harry. He was looking at the other boys. Both of them were
thickset and looked extremely mean. Standing on either side of the pale boy,
they loo ibrary?”
“Because that’s what Hermione does,” said Ron, shrugging. “When in
doubt, go to the library.”
Harry stood, irresolute, trying to catch the voice again, but people were
now emerging from the Great Hall behind him, talking loudly, exiting through
the front doors on their way to the Quidditch pitch.
“You’d better get moving,” said Ron. “It’s nearly eleven — the match —”
Harry raced up to Gryffindor Tower, collected his Nimbus Two Thousand,
and joined the large crowd swarming across the grounds, but his mind was
still in the castle along with the bodiless voice, and as he pulled on his scarlet
robes in the locker room, his only comfort was that everyone was now outside
to watch the game.
The teams walked onto the field to tumultuous applause. Oliver Wood took
off for a warm-up flight around the goalposts; Madam Hooch released the
balls. The Hufflepuffs, who played in canary yellow, were standing in a
huddle, having a last-minute discussion of tactics.
Harry was just mounting his broom when Professor McGo in
Quidditch team, the same position that Harry played on the Gryffindor team.
Crabbe and Goyle seemed to exist to do Malfoy’s bidding. They were both
wide and musclely; Crabbe was taller, with a pudding-bowl haircut and a very
thick neck; Goyle had short, bristly hair and long, gorilla-ish arms.
“Well, look who it is,” said Malfoy in his usual lazy drawl, pulling open the
compartment door. “Potty and the Weasel.”
Crabbe and Goyle chuckled trollishly.
“I heard your father finally got his hands on some gold this summer,
Weasley,” said Malfoy. “Did your mother die of shock?”
Ron stood up so quickly he knocked Crookshanks’s basket to the floor.
Professor Lupin gave a snort.
“Who’s that?” said Malfoy, taking an automatic step backward as he
spotted Lupin.
“New teacher,” said Harry, who got to his feet, too, in case he needed to
hold Ron back. “What were you saying, Malfoy?”
Malfoy’s pale eyes narrowed; he wasn’t fool enough to pick a fight right
under a teacher’s nose.
“C’mon,” he muttered resentfully to Crabbe a"

“I know who you are!” said Ron suddenly. “My brothers told me about you
— you’re Nearly Headless Nick!”
“I would 
prefer
 you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy —” the ghost began
stiffly, but sandy-haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted.
“

nearly
 headless?”
Sir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little chat wasn’t going at
all the way he wanted.
“Like 
this,
” he said irritably. He seized his left ear and pulled. His whole
head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge.
Someone had obviously tried to behead him, but not done it properly.
Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces, Nearly Headless Nick
flipped his head back onto his neck, coughed, and said, “So — new

year? Gryffindors have never gone so long without winning. Slytherins havegot the Cup six years ching the
bottom of the stairs, where Nearly Headless Nick, ghost of Gryffindor Tower,
stood waiting for him.
“Harry! My dear boy!”Nick made to grasp Harry’s hands with both of his own: Harry’s felt as
though they had been thrust into icy water.
“Nick, you’ve got to help me. Who’s the ghost of Ravenclaw Tower?”
Nearly Headless Nick looked surprised and a little offended.
“The Gray Lady, of course; but if it is ghostly services you require — ?”
“It’s got to be her — d’you know where she is?”
“Let’s see. . . .”
Nick’s head wobbled a little on his ruff as he turned hither and thither,
peering over the heads of the swarming students.
“That’s her over there, Harry, the young woman with the long hair.”
Harry looked in the direction of Nick’s transparent, pointing finger and saw
a tall ghost who caught sight of Harry looking at her, raised her eyebrows, and
drifted away through a solid wall.
Harry ran after her. Once through the door of the corridor into which she
had disappeared, he saw her at the very end of the p ings at friends from other Houses, eyeing one another’s new haircuts and
robes. Again Harry noticed people putting their heads together to whisper as
he passed; he gritted his teeth and tried to act as though he neither noticed nor
cared.
Luna drifted away from them at the Ravenclaw table. The moment they
reached Gryffindor’s, Ginny was hailed by some fellow fourth years and left
to sit with them; Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Neville found seats together
about halfway down the table between Nearly Headless Nick, the Gryffindor
House ghost, and Parvati Patil and Lavender Brown, the last two of whom
gave Harry airy, overly friendly greetings that made him quite sure they had
stopped talking about him a split second before. He had more important
things to worry about, however: He was looking over the students’ heads to
the staff table that ran along the top wall of the Hall.
“He’s not there.”
Ron and Hermione scanned the staff table too, though there was no real
need; Hagrid’s size made him instantly obvious in any k, the Gryffindor

Ron and Hermione scanned the staff table too, though there was no real

“He can’t have left,” said Ron, sounding slightly anxious.
“Of course he hasn’t,” said Harry firmly.
“You don’t think he’s . . . 
hurt, 
or anything, do you?” said Hermione
uneasily.
“No,” said Harry at once.
“But where is he, then?”
There was a pause, then Harry said very quietly, so that Neville, Parvati,
and Lavender could not hear, “Maybe he’s not back yet. You know — from
his mission — the thing he was doing over the summer for Dumbledore.”
“Yeah . . . yeah, that’ll be it,” said Ron, sounding  the wizard’s bidding. A ghost, as I trust
that you are all aware by now, is the imprint of a departed soul left upon the
earth . . . and of course, as Potter so wisely tells us, 
transparent.
”
“Well, what Harry said is the most useful if we’re trying to tell them apart!”
said Ron. “When we come face-to-face with one down a dark alley, we’re
going to be having a shufti to see if it’s solid, aren’t we, we’re not going to be
asking, ‘Excuse me, are you the imprint of a departed soul?’”
There was a ripple of laughter, instantly quelled by the look Snape gave the
class.
“Another ten points from Gryffindor,” said Snape. “I would expect nothing
more sophisticated from you, Ronald Weasley, the boy so solid he cannot
Apparate half an inch across a room.”
“No!”
 whispered Hermione, grabbing Harry’s arm as he opened his mouth
furiously. “There’s no point, you’ll just end up in detention again, leave it!”
“Now open your books to page two hundred and thirteen,” said Snape,
smirking a little, “and read the first two parag tarved Harry, but he’d never been allowed
to eat as much as he liked. Dudley had always taken anything that Harry
really wanted, even if it made him sick. Harry piled his plate with a bit of
everything except the peppermints and began to eat. It was all delicious.
“That does look good,” said the ghost in the ruff sadly, watching Harry cut
up his steak.
“Can’t you — ?”
“I haven’t eaten for nearly five hundred years,” said the ghost. “I don’t
need to, of course, but one does miss it. I don’t think I’ve introduced myself?

“I know who you are!” said Ron suddenly. “My brothers told me about you

stiffly, but sandy-haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted.
“

Sir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little chat wasn’t going at
all the way he wanted.
“Like 
this,
” he said  rack of the students in their own Houses;
there was much pushing and shoving; Harry saw Zacharias Smith bowling
over first-years to get to the front of the queue; here and there younger
students were in tears, while older ones called desperately for friends or
siblings. . . .
Harry caught sight of a pearly white figure drifting across the entrance hall
below and yelled as loudly as he could over the clamor.
“Nick! NICK! I need to talk to you!”
He forced his way back through the tide of students, finally reaching the
bottom of the stairs, where Nearly Headless Nick, ghost of Gryffindor Tower,
stood waiting for him.
“Harry! My dear boy!”Nick made to grasp Harry’s hands with both of his own: Harry’s felt as
though they had been thrust into icy water.
“Nick, you’ve got to help me. Who’s the ghost of Ravenclaw Tower?”

“It’s got to be her — d’you know where she is?”

Charms teacher. Harry moved his eyes along the table, to the place where
Snape sat. Was he imagining it, or were Snape’s eyes flickering toward Lupin
more often than was natural?
The feast finished with an entertainment provided by the Hogwarts ghosts.
They popped out of the walls and tables to do a bit of formation gliding;
Nearly Headless Nick, the Gryffindor ghost, had a great success with a
reenactment of his own botched beheading.
It had been such a pleasant evening that Harry’s good mood couldn’t even
be spoiled by Malfoy, who shouted through the crowd as they all left the hall,
“The dementors send their love, Potter!”Harry, Ron, and Hermione followed the rest of the Gryffindors along the
usual path to Gryffindor Tower, but when they reached the corridor that ended
with the portrait of the Fat Lady, they found it jammed with students.
“Why isn’t anyone going in?” said Ron curiously.
Harry peered over the heads in front of him. The portrait seemed to "

“C’mon, let’s go. If we hurry we’ll be able to follow the Hogwarts Express

And they marched off through the crowd of curious Muggles, out of the
station and back onto the side road where the old Ford Anglia was parked.
Ron unlocked the cavernous trunk with a series of taps from his wand.
They heaved their luggage back in, put Hedwig on the back seat, and got into
the front.
“Check that no one’s watching,” said Ron, starting the ignition with another
tap of his wand. Harry stuck his head out of the window: Traffic was
rumbling along the main road ahead, but their street was empty.
“Okay,” he said.
Ron pressed a tiny silver button on the dashboard. The car around them
vanished — and so did they. Harry could feel the seat vibrating beneath him,
hear the engine, feel his hands on his knees and his glasses on his nose, but
for all he could see, he had become a pair of eyeballs, floating a few feet
above the ground in a dingy street full of parked cars.
“Let’s go,” said Ron’s voi  back to us.”
They looked around. People were still watching them, mainly because of
Hedwig’s continuing screeches.
“I think we’d better go and wait by the car,” said Harry. “We’re attracting
too much atten —”
“Harry!” said Ron, his eyes gleaming. “The car!”
“What about it?”
“We can fly the car to Hogwarts!”
“But I thought —”
“We’re stuck, right? And we’ve got to get to school, haven’t we? And even
underage wizards are allowed to use magic if it’s a real emergency, section
nineteen or something of the Restriction of Thingy —”
“But your mum and dad . . .” said Harry, pushing against the barrier again
in the vain hope that it would give way. “How will they get home?”
“They don’t need the car!” said Ron impatiently. “They know how toApparate! You know, just vanish and reappear at home! They only bother
with Floo powder and the car because we’re all underage and we’re not
allowed to Apparate yet. . . .”
Harry’s feeling of panic turned suddenly to excitement.
“Can you fly it?”
“No problem,” said Ron, wheeling his  iction of Thingy —”
“But your mum and dad . . .” said Harry, pushing against the barrier again
in the vain hope that it would give way. “How will they get home?”

Harry’s feeling of panic turned suddenly to excitement.
“Can you fly it?”
“No problem,” said Ron, wheeling his trolley around to face the exit.
“C’mon, let’s go. If we hurry we’ll be able to follow the Hogwarts Express

And they marched off through the crowd of curious Muggles, out of the
station and back onto the side road where the old Ford Anglia was parked.
Ron unlocked the cavernous trunk with a series of taps from his wand.
They heaved their luggage back in, put Hedwig on the back seat, and got into
the front.
“Check that no one’s watching,” said Ron, starting the ignition with another
tap of his wand. Harry  are those horse things?” Harry said, as he, Ron, and
Luna made for the carriage in which Hermione and Ginny were already
sitting.“What horse things?”
“The horse things pulling the carriages!” said Harry impatiently; they were,
after all, about three feet from the nearest one; it was watching them with
empty white eyes. Ron, however, gave Harry a perplexed look.
“What are you talking about?”
“I’m talking about — look!”
Harry grabbed Ron’s arm and wheeled him about so that he was face-to-
face with the winged horse. Ron stared straight at it for a second, then looked
back at Harry.
“What am I supposed to be looking at?”
“At the — there, between the shafts! Harnessed to the coach! It’s right
there in front —”
But as Ron continued to look bemused, a strange thought occurred to
Harry.
“Can’t . . . can’t you see them?”
“See 
what
?”
“Can’t you see what’s pulling the carriages?”
Ron looked seriously alarmed now.
“Are you feeling all right, Harry?”
“I . . . yeah . . .”
Harry felt utterly bewildered. The horse was th rting forward and snatching something out of the
grass. “It’s that stupid thing Longbottom’s gran sent him.”
The Remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up.
“Give that here, Malfoy,” said Harry quietly. Everyone stopped talking to
watch.
Malfoy smiled nastily.
“I think I’ll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find — how about — up
a tree?”
“Give it 
here
!” Harry yelled, but Malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick and
taken off. He hadn’t been lying, he 
could
 fly well. Hovering level with the
topmost branches of an oak he called, “Come and get it, Potter!”
Harry grabbed his broom.
“No!”
 shouted Hermione Granger. “Madam Hooch told us not to move —
you’ll get us all into trouble.”
Harry ignored her. Blood was pounding in his ears. He mounted the broom
and kicked hard against the ground and up, up he soared; air rushed through
his hair, and his robes whipped out behind him — and in a rush of fierce joy
he realized he’d found something he could do without being taught — this
was easy, this was 
wonderful.
 get who I’ve got with me.”
“Tie that around the bars,” said Fred, throwing the end of a rope to Harry.
“If the Dursleys wake up, I’m dead,” said Harry as he tied the rope tightly
around a bar and Fred revved up the car.
“Don’t worry,” said Fred, “and stand back.”
Harry moved back into the shadows next to Hedwig, who seemed to have
realized how important this was and kept still and silent. The car revved
louder and louder and suddenly, with a crunching noise, the bars were pulled
clean out of the window as Fred drove straight up in the air. Harry ran back to
the window to see the bars dangling a few feet above the ground. Panting,
Ron hoisted them up into the car. Harry listened anxiously, but there was no
sound from the Dursleys’ bedroom.
When the bars were safely in the back seat with Ron, Fred reversed as close
as possible to Harry’s window.
“Get in,” Ron said.
“But all my Hogwarts stuff — my wand — my broomstick —”
“Where is it?”
“Locked in the cupboard under the stairs, and I can’t get out of this room
—” ey were rolling through a snowy Hogsmeade. Harry caught a glimpse of
the Hog’s Head down its side street, the severed boar’s head sign creaking in
the wintry wind. Flecks of snow hit the large window at the front of the bus.
At last they rolled to a halt outside the gates to Hogwarts.
Lupin and Tonks helped them off the bus with their luggage and then got
off to say good-bye. Harry glanced up at the three decks of the Knight Bus
and saw all the passengers staring down at them, noses flat against the
windows.
“You’ll be safe once you’re in the grounds,” said Tonks, casting a careful
eye around at the deserted road. “Have a good term, okay?”
“Look after yourselves,” said Lupin, shaking hands all round and reaching
Harry last. “And listen . . .” He lowered his voice while the rest of them
exchanged last-minute good-byes with Tonks, “Harry, I know you don’t like
Snape, but he is a superb Occlumens and we all — Sirius included — want
you to learn to protect yourself, so work hard, all right?”
“Yeah, all right,” sa ? Go and fetch him, at once!”
Filch evidently thought Professor McGonagall had taken leave of her
senses, but hobbled away, hunch-shouldered, muttering under his breath.
“And now — 
Piertotum Locomotor!
” cried Professor McGonagall.
And all along the corridor the statues and suits of armor jumped down from
their plinths, and from the echoing crashes from the floors above and below,
Harry knew that their fellows throughout the castle had done the same.
“Hogwarts is threatened!” shouted Professor McGonagall. “Man the
boundaries, protect us, do your duty to our school!”
Clattering and yelling, the horde of moving statues stampeded past Harry:some of them smaller, others larger, than life. There were animals too, and the
clanking suits of armor brandished swords and spiked balls on chains.
“Now, Potter,” said McGonagall, “you and Miss Lovegood had better
return to your friends and bring them to the Great Hall — I shall rouse the
other Gryffindors.”
They parted at the top of the next staircase, Harry and Luna runn"
What is the name of the house elf who serves the Malfoy family?,Dobby,The house-elf who serves the Malfoy family is Kreacher.," Malfoy made Dudley Dursley look like a kind,
thoughtful, and sensitive boy.
“I don’t know whether the Malfoys own a house-elf. . . .” said Harry.
“Well, whoever owns him will be an old Wizarding family, and they’ll be
rich,” said Fred.
“Yeah, Mum’s always wishing we had a house-elf to do the ironing,” said
George. “But all we’ve got is a lousy old ghoul in the attic and gnomes all
over the garden. House-elves come with big old manors and castles and
places like that; you wouldn’t catch one in our house. . . .”Harry was silent. Judging by the fact that Draco Malfoy usually had the
best of everything, his family was rolling in wizard gold; he could just see
Malfoy strutting around a large manor house. Sending the family servant to
stop Harry from going back to Hogwarts also sounded exactly like the sort of
thing Malfoy would do. Had Harry been stupid to take Dobby seriously?
“I’m glad we came to get you, anyway,” said Ron. “I was getting really
worried when you didn’t answer any of my letters. I thought it was r
to a house-elf!”
“Yeah, we don’t need to hear about you being in love with Malfoy,” Harry
told Kreacher. “Let’s fast forward to where he’s actually been going.”
Kreacher bowed again, looking furious, and then said, “Master Malfoy eats
in the Great Hall, he sleeps in a dormitory in the dungeons, he attends his
classes in a variety of —”
“Dobby, you tell me,” said Harry, cutting across Kreacher. “Has he been
going anywhere he shouldn’t have?”

he is still keen to avoid detection. He has been making regular visits to the

“Must be, it’s not a very common name, is it?” said Harry. “Why?”
“I’ve heard Dad talking about him,” said George. “He was a big supporter
of You-Know-Who.”
“And when You-Know-Who disappeared,” said Fred, craning around to
look at Harry, “Lucius Malfoy came back saying he’d never meant any of it.
Load of dung — Dad reckons he was right in You-Know-Who’s inner circle.”
Harry had heard these rumors about Malfoy’s family before, and they
didn’t surprise him at all. Malfoy made Dudley Dursley look like a kind,
thoughtful, and sensitive boy.
“I don’t know whether the Malfoys own a house-elf. . . .” said Harry.
“Well, whoever owns him will be an old Wizarding family, and they’ll be
rich,” said Fred.
“Yeah, Mum’s always wishing we had a house-elf to do the ironing,” said
George. “But all we’ve got is a lousy old ghoul in the attic and gnomes all
over the garden. House-elves come with big old manors and castles and
places like that; you wouldn’t catch one in our house. .   Winky the house-elf
was fighting her way out of a clump of bushes nearby. She was moving in a
most peculiar fashion, apparently with great difficulty; it was as though
someone invisible were trying to hold her back.
“There is bad wizards about!” she squeaked distractedly as she leaned
forward and labored to keep running. “People high — high in the air! Winky
is getting out of the way!”
And she disappeared into the trees on the other side of the path, panting and
squeaking as she fought the force that was restraining her.
“What’s up with her
?
” said Ron, looking curiously after Winky. “Why
can’t she run properly?”
“Bet she didn’t ask permission to hide,” said Harry. He was thinking of
Dobby: Every time he had tried to do something the Malfoys wouldn’t like,
the house-elf had been forced to start beating himself up.
“You know, house-elves get a 
very
 raw deal!” said Hermione indignantly.
“It’s slavery, that’s what it is! That Mr. Crouch made her go up to the top of
the stadium, and she was terrified, and he’ frozen, staring at the elf. Then he lunged at Harry.
“You’ve lost me my servant, boy!”
But Dobby shouted, “You shall not harm Harry Potter!”
There was a loud bang, and Mr. Malfoy was thrown backward. He crashed
down the stairs, three at a time, landing in a crumpled heap on the landingbelow. He got up, his face livid, and pulled out his wand, but Dobby raised a
long, threatening finger.
“You shall go now,” he said fiercely, pointing down at Mr. Malfoy. “You
shall not touch Harry Potter. You shall go now.”
Lucius Malfoy had no choice. With a last, incensed stare at the pair of
them, he swung his cloak around him and hurried out of sight.
“Harry Potter freed Dobby!” said the elf shrilly, gazing up at Harry,
moonlight from the nearest window reflected in his orb-like eyes. “Harry
Potter set Dobby free!”
“Least I could do, Dobby,” said Harry, grinning. “Just promise never to try
and save my life again.”
The elf’s ugly brown face split suddenly into a wide, toothy smile.
“I’ve just got one question, Dobby,” said H  that’s ever happened to
this place. He loves Muggle-borns. A decent headmaster would never’ve letslime like that Creevey in.”
Malfoy started taking pictures with an imaginary camera and did a cruel
but accurate impression of Colin: “‘Potter, can I have your picture, Potter?
Can I have your autograph? Can I lick your shoes, please, Potter?’”
He dropped his hands and looked at Harry and Ron.
“What’s the 
matter
 with you two?”
Far too late, Harry and Ron forced themselves to laugh, but Malfoy seemed
satisfied; perhaps Crabbe and Goyle were always slow on the uptake.
“Saint Potter, the Mudbloods’ friend,” said Malfoy slowly. “He’s another
one with no proper wizard feeling, or he wouldn’t go around with that
jumped-up Granger Mudblood. And people think 
he’s
 Slytherin’s heir!”
Harry and Ron waited with bated breath: Malfoy was surely seconds away
from telling them it was him — but then —
“I 
wish
 I knew who it 
is
,” said Malfoy petulantly. “I could help them.”
Ron’s jaw dropped so that Crabbe looked even more  wearily to Harry. “I’m no
great shakes at languages; I need Barty Crouch for this sort of thing. Ah, I see
his house-elf’s saving him a seat. . . . Good job too, these Bulgarian blighters
have been trying to cadge all the best places . . . ah, and here’s Lucius!”
Harry, Ron, and Hermione turned quickly. Edging along the second row to
three still-empty seats right behind Mr. Weasley were none other than Dobby
the house-elf’s former owners: Lucius Malfoy; his son, Draco; and a woman
Harry supposed must be Draco’s mother.
Harry and Draco Malfoy had been enemies ever since their very first
journey to Hogwarts. A pale boy with a pointed face and white-blond hair,
Draco greatly resembled his father. His mother was blonde too; tall and slim,
she would have been nice-looking if she hadn’t been wearing a look that
suggested there was a nasty smell under her nose.
“Ah, Fudge,” said Mr. Malfoy, holding out his hand as he reached the
Minister of Magic. “How are you? I don’t think you’ve met my wife,
Narcissa? Or our son e told — look at Dobby!”
“Miss will please keep Dobby out of this,” Dobby mumbled, looking
scared. The cheery smiles had vanished from the faces of the house-elves
around the kitchen. They were suddenly looking at Hermione as though she
were mad and dangerous.
“We has your extra food!” squeaked an elf at Harry’s elbow, and he shoved
a large ham, a dozen cakes, and some fruit into Harry’s arms. “Good-bye!”
The house-elves crowded around Harry, Ron, and Hermione and began
shunting them out of the kitchen, many little hands pushing in the smalls of
their backs.
“Thank you for the socks, Harry Potter!” Dobby called miserably from the
hearth, where he was standing next to the lumpy tablecloth that was Winky.
“You couldn’t keep your mouth shut, could you, Hermione?” said Ron
angrily as the kitchen door slammed shut behind them. “They won’t want us
visiting them now! We could’ve tried to get more stuff out of Winky about
Crouch!”
“Oh as if you care about that!” scoffed Hermione. “You only like coming
down here for t"
Who is the Half-Blood Prince?,Severus Snape,"The Half-Blood Prince is a mysterious figure mentioned in the old Prophets, who is described as having a pure-blood mother and a Muggle father.","n birth to a —”
“— murderer,” spat Harry.
“Well . . . yes,” said Hermione. “So . . . I was sort of right. Snape must have
been proud of being ‘half a Prince,’ you see? Tobias Snape was a Muggle
from what it said in the 
Prophet.
”
“Yeah, that fits,” said Harry. “He’d play up the pure-blood side so he could
get in with Lucius Malfoy and the rest of them. . . . He’s just like Voldemort.
Pure-blood mother, Muggle father . . . ashamed of his parentage, trying to
make himself feared using the Dark Arts, gave himself an impressive new
name — 
Lord
 Voldemort — the Half-Blood 
Prince —
 how could Dumbledore
have missed — ?”
He broke off, looking out the window. He could not stop himself dwelling
upon Dumbledore’s inexcusable trust in Snape . . . but as Hermione had just
inadvertently reminded him, he, Harry, had been taken in just the same. . . . Inspite of the increasing nastiness of those scribbled spells, he had refused to
believe ill of the boy who had been so clever, who had helped him so
much. . . .
Helped him  If, say, her father wasa wizard whose surname was Prince, and her mother was a Muggle, then that
would make her a ‘half-blood Prince’!”
“Yeah, very ingenious, Hermione . . .”
“But it would! Maybe she was proud of being half a Prince!”
“Listen, Hermione, I can tell it’s not a girl. I can just tell.”
“The truth is that you don’t think a girl would have been clever enough,”
said Hermione angrily.
“How can I have hung round with you for five years and not think girls are
clever?” said Harry, stung by this. “It’s the way he writes, I just know the
Prince was a bloke, I can tell. This girl hasn’t got anything to do with it.
Where did you get this anyway?”
“The library,” said Hermione predictably. “There’s a whole collection of
old 
Prophets
 up there. Well, I’m going to find out more about Eileen Prince if
I can.”
“Enjoy yourself,” said Harry irritably.
“I will,” said Hermione. “And the first place I’ll look,” she shot at him, as
she reached the portrait hole, “is records of old Potions awards!”
Harry scowled afte rewolves deserve blood, that we ought to
revenge ourselves on normal people.”
“But you are normal!” said Harry fiercely. “You’ve just got a — a problem
—”
Lupin burst out laughing. “Sometimes you remind me a lot of James. He
called it my ‘furry little problem’ in company. Many people were under the
impression that I owned a badly behaved rabbit.”
He accepted a glass of eggnog from Mr. Weasley with a word of thanks,
looking slightly more cheerful. Harry, meanwhile, felt a rush of excitement:
This last mention of his father had reminded him that there was something he
had been looking forward to asking Lupin.
“Have you ever heard of someone called the Half-Blood Prince?”
“The Half-Blood what?”
“Prince,” said Harry, watching him closely for signs of recognition.
“There are no Wizarding princes,” said Lupin, now smiling. “Is this a title
you’re thinking of adopting? I should have thought being ‘the Chosen One’
would be enough.”
“It’s nothing to do with me!” said Harry indignantly. “The Half-Blood
Prince is someon n of his father had reminded him that there was something he
had been looking forward to asking Lupin.
“Have you ever heard of someone called the Half-Blood Prince?”
“The Half-Blood what?”
“Prince,” said Harry, watching him closely for signs of recognition.
“There are no Wizarding princes,” said Lupin, now smiling. “Is this a title
you’re thinking of adopting? I should have thought being ‘the Chosen One’
would be enough.”
“It’s nothing to do with me!” said Harry indignantly. “The Half-Blood
Prince is someone who used to go to Hogwarts, I’ve got his old Potions book.
He wrote spells all over it, spells he invented. One of them was Levicorpus
—”
“Oh, that one had a great vogue during my time at Hogwarts,” said Lupin
reminiscently. “There were a few months in my fifth year when you couldn’t
move for being hoisted into the air by your ankle.”
“My dad used it,” said Harry. “I saw him in the Pensieve, he used it on
Snape.”
He tried to sound casual, as though this was a throwaway comment of no
real importance, but h ,” she added, as Harry and Ron rolled their eyes, “because I’m
starting to think this Prince character was a bit dodgy.”
Both Harry and Ron shouted her down at once.
“It was a laugh!” said Ron, upending a ketchup bottle over his sausages.
“Just a laugh, Hermione, that’s all!”
“Dangling people upside down by the ankle?” said Hermione. “Who puts
their time and energy into making up spells like that?”
“Fred and George,” said Ron, shrugging, “it’s their kind of thing. And, er
—”
“My dad,” said Harry. He had only just remembered.
“What?” said Ron and Hermione together.
“My dad used this spell,” said Harry. “I — Lupin told me.”
This last part was not true; in fact, Harry had seen his father use the spell
on Snape, but he had never told Ron and Hermione about that particular
excursion into the Pensieve. Now, however, a wonderful possibility occurred
to him. Could the Half-Blood Prince possibly be — ?
“Maybe your dad did use it, Harry,” said Hermione, “but he’s not the only
one. We’ve seen a whole bunch of people use from the Half-Blood Prince than Snape or Slughorn have taught
me in —”
“I’m not talking about your stupid so-called Prince,” said Hermione, giving
his book a nasty look as though it had been rude to her. “I’m talking about
earlier. I went into the girls’ bathroom just before I came in here and there
were about a dozen girls in there, including that Romilda Vane, trying to
decide how to slip you a love potion. They’re all hoping they’re going to get
you to take them to Slughorn’s party, and they all seem to have bought Fred
and George’s love potions, which I’m afraid to say probably work —”
“Why didn’t you confiscate them then?” demanded Harry. It seemed
extraordinary that Hermione’s mania for upholding rules could have
abandoned her at this crucial juncture.
“They didn’t have the potions with them in the bathroom,” said Hermione
scornfully. “They were just discussing tactics. As I doubt whether even the
Half-Blood Prince

“
could dream
up an antidote for a dozen diff at!” said Hermione, her cheeks reddening. “I
just think it’s very irresponsible to start performing spells when you don’t
even know what they’re for, and stop talking about ‘the Prince’ as if it’s his
title, I bet it’s just a stupid nickname, and it doesn’t seem as though he was a
very nice person to me!”
“I don’t see where you get that from,” said Harry heatedly. “If he’d been a
budding Death Eater he wouldn’t have been boasting about being ‘half-
blood,’ would he?”
Even as he said it, Harry remembered that his father had been pure-blood,
but he pushed the thought out of his mind; he would worry about that
later. . . .
“The Death Eaters can’t all be pure-blood, there aren’t enough pure-blood
wizards left,” said Hermione stubbornly. “I expect most of them are half-
bloods pretending to be pure. It’s only Muggle-borns they hate, they’d be
quite happy to let you and Ron join up.”
“There is no way they’d let me be a Death Eater!” said Ron indignantly, a
bit of sausage flying off the fork he was now brandishing a h the picture
belonged; it was a rather dull story about interschool competitions.
“Her name was Eileen Prince. 
Prince,
 Harry.”
They looked at each other, and Harry realized what Hermione was trying to
say. He burst out laughing.
“No way.”
“What?”
“You think 
she
 was the Half-Blood . . . ? Oh, come on.”
“Well, why not? Harry, there aren’t any real princes in the Wizarding
world! It’s either a nickname, a made-up title somebody’s given themselves,
or it could be their actual name, couldn’t it? No, listen! If, say, her father wasa wizard whose surname was Prince, and her mother was a Muggle, then that
would make her a ‘half-blood Prince’!”
“Yeah, very ingenious, Hermione . . .”
“But it would! Maybe she was proud of being half a Prince!”
“Listen, Hermione, I can tell it’s not a girl. I can just tell.”
“The truth is that you don’t think a girl would have been clever enough,”
said Hermione angrily.
“How can I have hung round with you for five years and not think girls are

What is the spell to summon objects?,Accio,"The spell to summon objects is ""Accio"".","Summoning Charm.
“That’s better, Harry, that’s loads better,” Hermione said, looking exhausted
but very pleased.
“Well, now we know what to do next time I can’t manage a spell,” Harry
said, throwing a rune dictionary back to Hermione, so he could try again,
“threaten me with a dragon. Right . . .” He raised his wand once more. 
“Accio
Dictionary!”
The heavy book soared out of Hermione’s hand, flew across the room, and
Harry caught it.
“Harry, I really think you’ve got it!” said Hermione delightedly.
“Just as long as it works tomorrow,” Harry said. “The Firebolt’s going to be
much farther away than the stuff in here, it’s going to be in the castle, and I’m
going to be out there on the grounds. . . .”
“That doesn’t matter,” said Hermione firmly. “Just as long as you’re
concentrating really, really hard on it, it’ll come. Harry, we’d better get some
sleep . . . you’re going to need it.”
Harry had been focusing so hard on learning the Summoning Charm that
evening that some of his blind panic had left him. It retu n you, Harry,
that the charm might be too advanced for you. Many qualified wizards have
difficulty with it.”
“What does a Patronus look like?” said Harry curiously.
“Each one is unique to the wizard who conjures it.”
“And how do you conjure it?”“With an incantation, which will work only if you are concentrating, with
all your might, on a single, very happy memory.”
Harry cast his mind about for a happy memory. Certainly, nothing that had
happened to him at the Dursleys’ was going to do. Finally, he settled on the
moment when he had first ridden a broomstick.
“Right,” he said, trying to recall as exactly as possible the wonderful,
soaring sensation of his stomach.
“The incantation is this —” Lupin cleared his throat. 
“Expecto Patronum!”
“Expecto Patronum,” 
Harry repeated under his breath, 
“Expecto
Patronum.”
“Concentrating hard on your happy memory?”
“Oh — yeah —” said Harry, quickly forcing his thoughts back to that first
broom ride. 
“Expecto Patrono
 — no, 
Patronum
 — sorry — 
Expecto
Patronum, Expecto  ion, it isagainst nature.”
“But how do you do it?”
“By an act of evil — the supreme act of evil. By committing murder.
Killing rips the soul apart. The wizard intent upon creating a Horcrux would
use the damage to his advantage: He would encase the torn portion —”
“Encase? But how — ?”
“There is a spell, do not ask me, I don’t know!” said Slughorn, shaking his
head like an old elephant bothered by mosquitoes. “Do I look as though I
have tried it — do I look like a killer?”
“No, sir, of course not,” said Riddle quickly. “I’m sorry . . . I didn’t mean to
offend . . .”
“Not at all, not at all, not offended,” said Slughorn gruffly. “It’s natural to
feel some curiosity about these things. . . . Wizards of a certain caliber have
always been drawn to that aspect of magic. . . .”
“Yes, sir,” said Riddle. “What I don’t understand, though — just out of
curiosity — I mean, would one Horcrux be much use? Can you only split
your soul once? Wouldn’t it be better, make you stronger, to have your soul in
more pieces, I mean, , from which Harry retrieved it with a Summoning Charm.
Glancing around he thought he had been right to suggest that they practice the
basics first; there was a lot of shoddy spellwork going on; many people were
not succeeding in disarming their opponents at all, but merely causing them to
jump backward a few paces or wince as the feeble spell whooshed over them.“Expelliarmus!” 
said Neville, and Harry, caught unawares, felt his wand
fly out of his hand.
“I DID IT!” said Neville gleefully. “I’ve never done it before — I DID IT!”
“Good one!” said Harry encouragingly, deciding not to point out that in a
real duel situation Neville’s opponent was unlikely to be staring in the
opposite direction with his wand held loosely at his side. “Listen, Neville, can
you take it in turns to practice with Ron and Hermione for a couple of minutes
so I can walk around and see how the rest are doing?”
Harry moved off into the middle of the room. Something very odd was
happening to Zacharias Smith; every time he opened his mouth a cupboard under my desk he’ll like.”
“Okay,” said Harry, trying to sound as though he wasn’t apprehensive at all
and merely glad that Lupin had found such a good substitute for a real
dementor.
“So . . .” Professor Lupin had taken out his own wand, and indicated that
Harry should do the same. “The spell I am going to try and teach you is
highly advanced magic, Harry — well beyond Ordinary Wizarding Level. It
is called the Patronus Charm.”
“How does it work?” said Harry nervously.
“Well, when it works correctly, it conjures up a Patronus,” said Lupin,
“which is a kind of anti-dementor — a guardian that acts as a shield between
you and the dementor.”
Harry had a sudden vision of himself crouching behind a Hagrid-sized
figure holding a large club. Professor Lupin continued, “The Patronus is a
kind of positive force, a projection of the very things that the dementor feeds
upon — hope, happiness, the desire to survive — but it cannot feel despair, as
real humans can, so the dementors can’t hurt it. But I must war e crystal ball.
“Good day, my dear,” she said softly. “If you would kindly gaze into the
Orb. . . . Take your time, now . . . then tell me what you see within it. . . .”
Harry bent over the crystal ball and stared, stared as hard as he could,
willing it to show him something other than swirling white fog, but nothing
happened.
“Well?” Professor Trelawney prompted delicately. “What do you see?”
The heat was overpowering and his nostrils were stinging with the
perfumed smoke wafting from the fire beside them. He thought of what Ron
had just said, and decided to pretend.
“Er —” said Harry, “a dark shape . . . um . . .”
“What does it resemble?” whispered Professor Trelawney. “Think,
now . . .”
Harry cast his mind around and it landed on Buckbeak.
“A hippogriff,” he said firmly.
“Indeed!” whispered Professor Trelawney, scribbling keenly on the
parchment perched upon her knees. “My boy, you may well be seeing the
outcome of poor Hagrid’s trouble with the Ministry of Magic! Look
closer. . . . Does the hippogriff app  and found himself facing a
Blast-Ended Skrewt.
Cedric was right — it 
was
 enormous. Ten feet long, it looked more like a
giant scorpion than anything. Its long sting was curled over its back. Its thick
armor glinted in the light from Harry’s wand, which he pointed at it.
“Stupefy!”The spell hit the skrewt’s armor and rebounded; Harry ducked just in time,
but could smell burning hair; it had singed the top of his head. The skrewt
issued a blast of fire from its end and flew forward toward him.
“Impedimenta!”
 Harry yelled. The spell hit the skrewt’s armor again and
ricocheted off; Harry staggered back a few paces and fell over.
“IMPEDIMENTA!”
The skrewt was inches from him when it froze — he had managed to hit it
on its fleshy, shell-less underside. Panting, Harry pushed himself away from it
and ran, hard, in the opposite direction — the Impediment Curse was not
permanent; the skrewt would be regaining the use of its legs at any moment.
He took a left path and hit a dead end, a right, and hit another; forcin demort. He sent
another Killing Curse at Dumbledore but missed, instead hitting the security
guard’s desk, which burst into flame.
Dumbledore flicked his own wand. The force of the spell that emanated
from it was such that Harry, though shielded by his stone guard, felt his hair
stand on end as it passed, and this time Voldemort was forced to conjure a
shining silver shield out of thin air to deflect it. The spell, whatever it was,
caused no visible damage to the shield, though a deep, gonglike note
reverberated from it, an oddly chilling sound. . . .“You do not seek to kill me, Dumbledore?” called Voldemort, his scarlet
eyes narrowed over the top of the shield. “Above such brutality, are you?”
“We both know that there are other ways of destroying a man, Tom,”
Dumbledore said calmly, continuing to walk toward Voldemort as though he
had not a fear in the world, as though nothing had happened to interrupt his
stroll up the hall. “Merely taking your life would not satisfy me, I admit —”
“There is nothing worse t"

There was a short silence in which many members of the class turned their
heads to frown at the three course aims still written on the blackboard.
“
Using
 defensive spells?” Professor Umbridge repeated with a little laugh.
“Why, I can’t imagine any situation arising in my classroom that would
require you to 
use
 a defensive spell, Miss Granger. You surely aren’t
expecting to be attacked during class?”
“We’re not going to use magic?” Ron ejaculated loudly.
“Students raise their hands when they wish to speak in my class, Mr. — ?”
“Weasley,” said Ron, thrusting his hand into the air.
Professor Umbridge, smiling still more widely, turned her back on him.
Harry and Hermione immediately raised their hands too. Professor
Umbridge’s pouchy eyes lingered on Harry for a moment before she
addressed Hermione.
“Yes, Miss Granger? You wanted to ask something else?”
“Yes,” said Hermione. “Surely the whole point of Defense Against the
Dark Arts is to practice defensive spells?”
“Are you a Minis he teaches?” said Ron, frowning at Professor Lupin’s pallid
profile.
“That’s obvious,” whispered Hermione. “There’s only one vacancy, isn’t
there? Defense Against the Dark Arts.”
Harry, Ron, and Hermione had already had two Defense Against the Dark
Arts teachers, both of whom had lasted only one year. There were rumors that
the job was jinxed.
“Well, I hope he’s up to it,” said Ron doubtfully. “He looks like one good
hex would finish him off, doesn’t he? Anyway . . .” He turned to Harry.
“What were you going to tell us?”
Harry explained all about Mr. and Mrs. Weasley’s argument and the
warning Mr. Weasley had just given him. When he’d finished, Ron looked
thunderstruck, and Hermione had her hands over her mouth. She finally
lowered them to say, “Sirius Black escaped to come after 
you
? Oh, Harry . . .
you’ll have to be really, really careful. Don’t go looking for trouble, Harry
—”
“I don’t go looking for trouble,” said Harry, nettled. “Trouble usually finds
me.”
“How thick would Harry have to be, to go looki gainst the Dark Arts,” said
Hermione.
“Me?” said Harry, now grinning more broadly than ever. “No I’m not,
you’ve beaten me in every test —”
“Actually, I haven’t,” said Hermione coolly. “You beat me in our third year
— the only year we both sat the test and had a teacher who actually knew the
subject. But I’m not talking about test results, Harry. Look what you’ve
done
!”
“How d’you mean?”
“You know what, I’m not sure I want someone this stupid teaching me,”
Ron said to Hermione, smirking slightly. He turned to Harry. “Let’s think,” he
said, pulling a face like Goyle concentrating. “Uh . . . first year — you saved
the Stone from You-Know-Who.”
“But that was luck,” said Harry, “that wasn’t skill —”
“Second year,” Ron interrupted, “you killed the basilisk and destroyed
Riddle.”
“Yeah, but if Fawkes hadn’t turned up I —”
“Third year,” said Ron, louder still, “you fought off about a hundred
dementors at once —”
“You know that was a fluke, if the Time-Turner hadn’t —”
“Last year,” Ron said, almost shouting now, “yo was still fighting his way across the
lake with the first years; Professor McGonagall was presumably supervisingthe drying of the entrance hall floor, but there was another empty chair too,
and Harry couldn’t think who else was missing.
“Where’s the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher?” said Hermione,
who was also looking up at the teachers.
They had never yet had a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher who had
lasted more than three terms. Harry’s favorite by far had been Professor
Lupin, who had resigned last year. He looked up and down the staff table.
There was definitely no new face there.
“Maybe they couldn’t get anyone!” said Hermione, looking anxious.
Harry scanned the table more carefully. Tiny little Professor Flitwick, the
Charms teacher, was sitting on a large pile of cushions beside Professor
Sprout, the Herbology teacher, whose hat was askew over her flyaway gray
hair. She was talking to Professor Sinistra of the Astronomy department. On
Professor Sinistra’s other side was the sallow-faced their level,” she said briskly to
Snape’s back. “Though I would question whether it is advisable to teach them
a potion like the Strengthening Solution. I think the Ministry would prefer it if
that was removed from the syllabus.”
Snape straightened up slowly and turned to look at her.
“Now . . . how long have you been teaching at Hogwarts?” she asked, her
quill poised over her clipboard.
“Fourteen years,” Snape replied. His expression was unfathomable. His
eyes on Snape, Harry added a few drops to his potion; it hissed menacingly
and turned from turquoise to orange.
“You applied first for the Defense Against the Dark Arts post, I believe?”
Professor Umbridge asked Snape.
“Yes,” said Snape quietly.
“But you were unsuccessful?”
Snape’s lip curled.
“Obviously.”
Professor Umbridge scribbled on her clipboard.
“And you have applied regularly for the Defense Against the Dark Arts
post since you first joined the school, I believe?”
“Yes,” said Snape quietly, barely moving his lips. He looked very angry.
“Do you have  thing for a whole
year —”
“We can’t do much by ourselves,” said Ron in a defeated voice. “I mean,
all right, we can go and look jinxes up in the library and try and practice
them, I suppose —”
“No, I agree, we’ve gone past the stage where we can just learn things out
of books,” said Hermione. “We need a teacher, a proper one, who can show us
how to use the spells and correct us if we’re going wrong.”
“If you’re talking about Lupin . . .” Harry began.
“No, no, I’m not talking about Lupin,” said Hermione. “He’s too busy with
the Order and anyway, the most we could see him is during Hogsmeade
weekends and that’s not nearly often enough.”
“Who, then?” said Harry, frowning at her.
Hermione heaved a very deep sigh.
“Isn’t it obvious?” she said. “I’m talking about 
you,
 Harry.”
There was a moment’s silence. A light night breeze rattled the
windowpanes behind Ron and the fire guttered.
“About me what?” said Harry.
“I’m talking about 
you
 teaching us Defense Against the Dark Arts.”
Harry stared at her. Then he turne n; it hissed menacingly
and turned from turquoise to orange.
“You applied first for the Defense Against the Dark Arts post, I believe?”
Professor Umbridge asked Snape.
“Yes,” said Snape quietly.
“But you were unsuccessful?”
Snape’s lip curled.
“Obviously.”
Professor Umbridge scribbled on her clipboard.
“And you have applied regularly for the Defense Against the Dark Arts
post since you first joined the school, I believe?”
“Yes,” said Snape quietly, barely moving his lips. He looked very angry.
“Do you have any idea why Dumbledore has consistently refused to
appoint you?” asked Umbridge.
“I suggest you ask him,” said Snape jerkily.
“Oh I shall,” said Professor Umbridge with a sweet smile.
“I suppose this is relevant?” Snape asked, his black eyes narrowed.“Oh yes,” said Professor Umbridge. “Yes, the Ministry wants a thorough
understanding of teachers’ — er — backgrounds . . .”
She turned away, walked over to Pansy Parkinson and began questioning
her about the lessons. Snape looked around at Harry and their eyes e Against the Dark Arts again, I’m skiving off,”
said Ron as they headed toward Lupin’s classroom after lunch. “Check who’s
in there, Hermione.”
Hermione peered around the classroom door.
“It’s okay!”
Professor Lupin was back at work. It certainly looked as though he had
been ill. His old robes were hanging more loosely on him and there were dark
shadows beneath his eyes; nevertheless, he smiled at the class as they took
their seats, and they burst at once into an explosion of complaints about
Snape’s behavior while Lupin had been ill.“It’s not fair, he was only filling in, why should he give us homework?”
“We don’t know anything about werewolves —”
“— two rolls of parchment!”
“Did you tell Professor Snape we haven’t covered them yet?” Lupin asked,
frowning slightly.
The babble broke out again.
“Yes, but he said we were really behind —”
“— he wouldn’t listen —”
“— two rolls of parchment!”
Professor Lupin smiled at the look of indignation on every face.
“Don’t worry. I’ll speak to Professor Snape. You don’t ha"

the Stone.”
“
You
 let the troll in?”
“Certainly. I have a special gift with trolls — you must have seen what I
did to the one in the chamber back there? Unfortunately, while everyone else
was running around looking for it, Snape, who already suspected me, went
straight to the third floor to head me off — and not only did my troll fail to
beat you to death, that three-headed dog didn’t even manage to bite Snape’s
leg off properly.
“Now, wait quietly, Potter. I need to examine this interesting mirror.”
It was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell. It
was the Mirror of Erised.
“This mirror is the key to finding the Stone,” Quirrell murmured, tapping
his way around the frame. “Trust Dumbledore to come up with something like
this . . . but he’s in London . . . I’ll be far away by the time he gets back. . . .”
All Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and stop him
from concentrating on the mirror.
“I saw you and Sna  said Ron finally. “If any dog needs exercise, that one does.”
Hermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again.
“You don’t use your eyes, any of you, do you?” she snapped. “Didn’t you
see what it was standing on?”
“The floor?” Harry suggested. “I wasn’t looking at its feet, I was too busy
with its heads.”
“No, 
not
 the floor. It was standing on a trapdoor. It’s obviously guardingsomething.”
She stood up, glaring at them.
“I hope you’re pleased with yourselves. We could all have been killed — or
worse, expelled. Now, if you don’t mind, I’m going to bed.”
Ron stared after her, his mouth open.
“No, we don’t mind,” he said. “You’d think we dragged her along,
wouldn’t you?”
But Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as he climbed
back into bed. The dog was guarding something. . . . What had Hagrid said?
Gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to hide
— except perhaps Hogwarts.
It looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby little package
from v ault seven hundred and thirteen was.M
 
CHAPTER  TEN
HALLOWEEN
alfoy couldn’t believe his eyes when he saw that Harry and Ron were
still at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful.
Indeed, by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the three-
headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were quite keen to have
another one. In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the package that
seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot
of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection.
“It’s either really valuable or really dangerous,” said Ron.
“Or both,” said Harry.
But as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was
about two inches long, they didn’t have much chance of guessing what it was
without further clues.
Neither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay
underneath the dog and the trapdoor. All Neville cared about was never going
near the dog again.
Hermione was now refusing to spea library?”
Hagrid shuffled into view, hiding something behind his back. He looked
very out of place in his moleskin overcoat.
“Jus’ lookin’,” he said, in a shifty voice that got their interest at once. “An’
what’re you lot up ter?” He looked suddenly suspicious. “Yer not still lookin’
fer Nicolas Flamel, are yeh?”
“Oh, we found out who he is ages ago,” said Ron impressively. “
And
 we
know what that dog’s guarding, it’s a Sorcerer’s St —”
“Shhhh!”
 Hagrid looked around quickly to see if anyone was listening.
“Don’ go shoutin’ about it, what’s the matter with yeh?”
“There are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a matter of fact,” said
Harry, “about what’s guarding the Stone apart from Fluffy —”
“SHHHH!” said Hagrid again. “Listen — come an’ see me later, I’m not
promisin’ I’ll tell yeh anythin’, mind, but don’ go rabbitin’ about it in here,
students aren’ s’pposed ter know. They’ll think I’ve told yeh —”
“See you later, then,” said Harry.
Hagrid shuffled off.“What was he hiding behind his back?” said Hermione ocus’— I reckon there are other
things guarding the stone apart from Fluffy, loads of enchantments, probably,
and Quirrell would have done some anti-Dark Arts spell that Snape needs to
break through —”
“So you mean the Stone’s only safe as long as Quirrell stands up to
Snape?” said Hermione in alarm.
“It’ll be gone by next Tuesday,” said Ron.Q
 
CHAPTER  FOURTEEN
NORBERT THE NORWEGIAN RIDGEBACK
uirrell, however, must have been braver than they’d thought. In the
weeks that followed he did seem to be getting paler and thinner, but it
didn’t look as though he’d cracked yet.
Every time they passed the third-floor corridor, Harry, Ron, and Hermione
would press their ears to the door to check that Fluffy was still growling
inside. Snape was sweeping about in his usual bad temper, which surely
meant that the Stone was still safe. Whenever Harry passed Quirrell these
days he gave him an encouraging sort of smile, and Ron had started telling
people off for laughing at Quirrell’s stutter.
Hermione, however, had more on -
black dog.
Harry reached for his wand, but too late — the dog had made an enormous
leap and the front paws hit him on the chest; he keeled over backward in a
whirl of hair; he felt its hot breath, saw inch-long teeth —
But the force of its leap had carried it too far; it rolled off him. Dazed,
feeling as though his ribs were broken, Harry tried to stand up; he could hear
it growling as it skidded around for a new attack.
Ron was on his feet. As the dog sprang back toward them he pushed Harry
aside; the dog’s jaws fastened instead around Ron’s outstretched arm. Harry
lunged forward, he seized a handful of the brute’s hair, but it was dragging
Ron away as easily as though he were a rag doll —
Then, out of nowhere, something hit Harry so hard across the face he was
knocked off his feet again. He heard Hermione shriek with pain and fall too.
Harry groped for his wand, blinking blood out of his eyes —
“Lumos!”
 he whispered.
The wandlight showed him the trunk of a thick tree; they had chased
Scabbers into the sh kidded to a stop right in
front of him. He was sprawled on the ground, but Scabbers was back in his
pocket; he had both hands held tight over the quivering lump.“Ron — come on — back under the cloak —” Hermione panted.
“Dumbledore — the Minister — they’ll be coming back out in a minute —”
But before they could cover themselves again, before they could even catch
their breath, they heard the soft pounding of gigantic paws. . . . Something
was bounding toward them out of the dark — an enormous, pale-eyed, jet-
black dog.
Harry reached for his wand, but too late — the dog had made an enormous
leap and the front paws hit him on the chest; he keeled over backward in a
whirl of hair; he felt its hot breath, saw inch-long teeth —
But the force of its leap had carried it too far; it rolled off him. Dazed,
feeling as though his ribs were broken, Harry tried to stand up; he could hear
it growling as it skidded around for a new attack.
Ron was on his feet. As the dog sprang back toward them he pushed Harry
aside; the do ht into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a dog thatfilled the whole space between ceiling and floor. It had three heads. Three
pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching and quivering in their
direction; three drooling mouths, saliva hanging in slippery ropes from
yellowish fangs.
It was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and Harry knew that
the only reason they weren’t already dead was that their sudden appearance
had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over that, there was no
mistaking what those thunderous growls meant.
Harry groped for the doorknob — between Filch and death, he’d take Filch.
They fell backward — Harry slammed the door shut, and they ran, they
almost flew, back down the corridor. Filch must have hurried off to look for
them somewhere else, because they didn’t see him anywhere, but they hardly
cared — all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible between
them and that monster. They didn’t stop running until they reached the
portrait of the Fat Lad"
What creature is Aragog?,Acromantula,Aragog is a giant spider.,"d with the light
spilling from Hagrid’s window to illuminate Aragog’s body lying on the edge
of a massive pit beside a ten-foot-high mound of freshly dug earth.
“Magnificent,” said Slughorn, approaching the spider’s head, where eight
milky eyes stared blankly at the sky and two huge, curved pincers shone,
motionless, in the moonlight. Harry thought he heard the tinkle of bottles as
Slughorn bent over the pincers, apparently examining the enormous hairy
head.
“It’s not ev’ryone appreciates how beau’iful they are,” said Hagrid to
Slughorn’s back, tears leaking from the corners of his crinkled eyes. “I didn’
know yeh were int’rested in creatures like Aragog, Horace.”
“Interested? My dear Hagrid, I revere them,” said Slughorn, stepping back
from the body. Harry saw the glint of a bottle disappear beneath his cloak,
though Hagrid, mopping his eyes once more, noticed nothing. “Now . . . shall
we proceed to the burial?”
Hagrid nodded and moved forward. He heaved the gigantic spider into his
arms and, with an enormou oad.
Harry fell to the ground on all fours as the spider released him. Ron and
Fang thudded down next to him. Fang wasn’t howling anymore, but cowering
silently on the spot. Ron looked exactly like Harry felt. His mouth was
stretched wide in a kind of silent scream and his eyes were popping.
Harry suddenly realized that the spider that had dropped him was saying
something. It had been hard to tell, because he clicked his pincers with every
word he spoke.
“Aragog!” it called. “Aragog!”
And from the middle of the misty, domed web, a spider the size of a small
elephant emerged, very slowly. There was gray in the black of his body and
legs, and each of the eyes on his ugly, pincered head was milky white. He was
blind.
“What is it?” he said, clicking his pincers rapidly.
“Men,” clicked the spider who had caught Harry.
“Is it Hagrid?” said Aragog, moving closer, his eight milky eyes wandering
vaguely.
“Strangers,” clicked the spider who had brought Ron.
“Kill them,” clicked Aragog fretfully. “I was sleeping. . . .” pes shifted all around him.
“The thing that lives in the castle,” said Aragog, “is an ancient creature we
spiders fear above all others. Well do I remember how I pleaded with Hagrid
to let me go, when I sensed the beast moving about the school.”
“What is it?” said Harry urgently.
More loud clicking, more rustling; the spiders seemed to be closing in.
“We do not speak of it!” said Aragog fiercely. “We do not name it! I never
even told Hagrid the name of that dread creature, though he asked me, many
times.”
Harry didn’t want to press the subject, not with the spiders pressing closer
on all sides. Aragog seemed to be tired of talking. He was backing slowly into
his domed web, but his fellow spiders continued to inch slowly toward Harry
and Ron.
“We’ll just go, then,” Harry called desperately to Aragog, hearing leaves
rustling behind him.
“Go?” said Aragog slowly. “I think not. . . .”
“But — but —”
“My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid, on my command. But I
cannot deny them fresh meat, when it wanders so will gog, king of arachnids, whose
long and faithful friendship those who knew you won’t forget! Though your
body will decay, your spirit lingers on in the quiet, web-spun places of your
forest home. May your many-eyed descendants ever flourish and your human
friends find solace for the loss they have sustained.”“Tha’ was . . . tha’ was . . . beau’iful!” howled Hagrid, and he collapsed
onto the compost heap, crying harder than ever.
“There, there,” said Slughorn, waving his wand so that the huge pile of
earth rose up and then fell, with a muffled sort of crash, onto the dead spider,
forming a smooth mound. “Let’s get inside and have a drink. Get on his other
side, Harry. . . . That’s it. . . . Up you come, Hagrid . . . Well done . . .”
They deposited Hagrid in a chair at the table. Fang, who had been skulking
in his basket during the burial, now came padding softly across to them and
put his heavy head into Harry’s lap as usual. Slughorn uncorked one of the
bottles of wine he had brought.
“I have had it 
all
 test  with his brutal giant of a half-brother,
but this was perhaps the most incomprehensible of all his monster fancies: the
gigantic talking spider, Aragog, who dwelled deep in the Forbidden Forest
and which he and Ron had only narrowly escaped four years previously.
“Is there — is there anything we can do?” Hermione asked, ignoring Ron’s
frantic grimaces and head-shakings.
“I don’ think there is, Hermione,” choked Hagrid, attempting to stem the
flood of his tears. “See, the rest o’ the tribe . . . Aragog’s family . . . they’re
gettin’ a bit funny now he’s ill . . . bit restive . . .”
“Yeah, I think we saw a bit of that side of them,” said Ron in an undertone.
“. . . I don’ reckon it’d be safe fer anyone but me ter go near the colony at
the mo’,” Hagrid finished, blowing his nose hard on his apron and looking up.
“But thanks fer offerin’, Hermione. . . . It means a lot. . . .”
After that, the atmosphere lightened considerably, for although neither
Harry nor Ron had shown any inclination to go and feed giant grub  the misty, domed web, a spider the size of a small
elephant emerged, very slowly. There was gray in the black of his body and
legs, and each of the eyes on his ugly, pincered head was milky white. He was
blind.
“What is it?” he said, clicking his pincers rapidly.
“Men,” clicked the spider who had caught Harry.
“Is it Hagrid?” said Aragog, moving closer, his eight milky eyes wandering
vaguely.
“Strangers,” clicked the spider who had brought Ron.
“Kill them,” clicked Aragog fretfully. “I was sleeping. . . .”
“We’re friends of Hagrid’s,” Harry shouted. His heart seemed to have lefthis chest to pound in his throat.
Click, click, click
 went the pincers of the spiders all around the hollow.
Aragog paused.
“Hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before,” he said slowly.
“Hagrid’s in trouble,” said Harry, breathing very fast. “That’s why we’ve
come.”
“In trouble?” said the aged spider, and Harry thought he heard concern
beneath the clicking pincers. “But why has he sent you?”
Harry thought of getting to his feet low, a hollow that had
been cleared of trees, so that the stars shone brightly onto the worst scene he
had ever laid eyes on.
Spiders. Not tiny spiders like those surging over the leaves below. Spiders
the size of carthorses, eight-eyed, eight-legged, black, hairy, gigantic. The
massive specimen that was carrying Harry made its way down the steep slope
toward a misty, domed web in the very center of the hollow, while its fellows
closed in all around it, clicking their pincers excitedly at the sight of its load.
Harry fell to the ground on all fours as the spider released him. Ron and
Fang thudded down next to him. Fang wasn’t howling anymore, but cowering
silently on the spot. Ron looked exactly like Harry felt. His mouth was
stretched wide in a kind of silent scream and his eyes were popping.
Harry suddenly realized that the spider that had dropped him was saying
something. It had been hard to tell, because he clicked his pincers with every
word he spoke.
“Aragog!” it called. “Aragog!”
And from the middle of s grunt, rolled it into the dark pit. It hit the bottom
with a rather horrible, crunchy thud. Hagrid started to cry again.
“Of course, it’s difficult for you, who knew him best,” said Slughorn, who
like Harry could reach no higher than Hagrid’s elbow, but patted it all the
same. “Why don’t I say a few words?”
He must have got a lot of good quality venom from Aragog, Harry thought,
for Slughorn wore a satisfied smirk as he stepped up to the rim of the pit and
said, in a slow, impressive voice, “Farewell, Aragog, king of arachnids, whose
long and faithful friendship those who knew you won’t forget! Though your
body will decay, your spirit lingers on in the quiet, web-spun places of your
forest home. May your many-eyed descendants ever flourish and your human
friends find solace for the loss they have sustained.”“Tha’ was . . . tha’ was . . . beau’iful!” howled Hagrid, and he collapsed
onto the compost heap, crying harder than ever.
“There, there,” said Slughorn, waving his wand so that the huge pile of

her,” sighed Ginny later that evening, as she, Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat
beside the open window of the Gryffindor common room, looking out over
the twilit grounds.
“She’s not that bad,” said Harry. “Ugly, though,” he added hastily, as Ginny
raised her eyebrows, and she let out a reluctant giggle.
“Well, I suppose if Mum can stand it, I can.”
“Anyone else we know died?” Ron asked Hermione, who was perusing the
Evening Prophet.
Hermione winced at the forced toughness in his voice. “No,” she said
reprovingly, folding up the newspaper. “They’re still looking for Snape but no
sign . . .”
“Of course there isn’t,” said Harry, who became angry every time this
subject cropped up. “They won’t find Snape till they find Voldemort, and
seeing as they’ve never managed to do that in all this time . . .”“I’m going to go to bed,” yawned Ginny. “I haven’t been sleeping that well
since . . . well . . . I could do with some sleep.”
She kissed Harry (Ron looked away pointedly), waved at the other from the spot.
Behind Harry, the entrance to the marquee revealed rows and rows of
fragile golden chairs set on either side of a long purple carpet. The supporting
poles were entwined with white and gold flowers. Fred and George had
fastened an enormous bunch of golden balloons over the exact point where
Bill and Fleur would shortly become husband and wife. Outside, butterflies
and bees were hovering lazily over the grass and hedgerow. Harry was rather
uncomfortable. The Muggle boy whose appearance he was affecting wasslightly fatter than him, and his dress robes felt hot and tight in the full glare
of a summer’s day.
“When I get married,” said Fred, tugging at the collar of his own robes, “I
won’t be bothering with any of this nonsense. You can all wear what you like,
and I’ll put a full Body-Bind Curse on Mum until it’s all over.”
“She wasn’t too bad this morning, considering,” said George. “Cried a bit
about Percy not being here, but who wants him? Oh blimey, brace yourselves
— here they come, look.”
Brigh ing to be married!”“Oh,” said Harry blankly. He could not help noticing how Mrs. Weasley,
Hermione, and Ginny were all determinedly avoiding one another’s gaze.
“Wow. Er — congratulations!”
She swooped down upon him and kissed him again.
“Bill is very busy at ze moment, working very ’ard, and I only work part-
time at Gringotts for my Eenglish, so he brought me ’ere for a few days to get
to know ’is family properly. I was so pleased to ’ear you would be coming —
zere isn’t much to do ’ere, unless you like cooking and chickens! Well —
enjoy your breakfast, ’Arry!”
With these words she turned gracefully and seemed to float out of the
room, closing the door quietly behind her.
Mrs. Weasley made a noise that sounded like “tchah!”
“Mum hates her,” said Ginny quietly.
“I do not hate her!” said Mrs. Weasley in a cross whisper. “I just think
they’ve hurried into this engagement, that’s all!”
“They’ve known each other a year,” said Ron, who looked oddly groggy
and was staring at the closed door.
“Well, that’s not very  partners?” He felt himself going red. “I don’t dance,” he said
quickly.
“Oh yes, you do,” said Professor McGonagall irritably. “That’s what I’m
telling you. Traditionally, the champions and their partners open the ball.”
Harry had a sudden mental image of himself in a top hat and tails,
accompanied by a girl in the sort of frilly dress Aunt Petunia always wore to
Uncle Vernon’s work parties.
“I’m not dancing,” he said.
“It is traditional,” said Professor McGonagall firmly. “You are a Hogwarts
champion, and you will do what is expected of you as a representative of the
school. So make sure you get yourself a partner, Potter.”
“But — I don’t —”
“You heard me, Potter,” said Professor McGonagall in a very final sort of
way.
A week ago, Harry would have said finding a partner for a dance would be a
cinch compared to taking on a Hungarian Horntail. But now that he had done
the latter, and was facing the prospect of asking a girl to the ball, he thought
he’d rather have another round with the dragon.
Harry had neve ayer, more lined; Fleur, slender and
beautiful, with her long silvery blonde hair; Kingsley, bald, black, broad-
shouldered; Hagrid, with his wild hair and beard, standing hunchbacked to
avoid hitting his head on the ceiling; and Mundungus Fletcher, small, dirty,
and hangdog, with his droopy basset hound’s eyes and matted hair. Harry’s
heart seemed to expand and glow at the sight: He felt incredibly fond of all of
them, even Mundungus, whom he had tried to strangle the last time they had
met.
“Kingsley, I thought you were looking after the Muggle Prime Minister?”
he called across the room.
“He can get along without me for one night,” said Kingsley. “You’re more
important.”
“Harry, guess what?” said Tonks from her perch on top of the washing
machine, and she wiggled her left hand at him; a ring glittered there.
“You got married?” Harry yelped, looking from her to Lupin.
“I’m sorry you couldn’t be there, Harry, it was very quiet.”
“That’s brilliant, congrat —”“All right, all right, we’ll have time for a cozy ca that he had not been thinking about the sword
at all when he suggested they go to Godric’s Hollow. For him, the lure of the
village lay in his parents’ graves, the house where he had narrowly escaped
death, and in the person of Bathilda Bagshot.
“Remember what Muriel said?” he asked eventually.
“Who?”
“You know,” he hesitated: He did not want to say Ron’s name. “Ginny’s
great-aunt. At the wedding. The one who said you had skinny ankles.”
“Oh,” said Hermione. It was a sticky moment: Harry knew that she had
sensed Ron’s name in the offing. He rushed on:
“She said Bathilda Bagshot still lives in Godric’s Hollow.”
“Bathilda Bagshot,” murmured Hermione, running her index finger over
Bathilda’s embossed name on the front cover of 
A History of Magic.
 “Well, I
suppose —”
She gasped so dramatically that Harry’s insides turned over; he drew his
wand, looking around at the entrance, half expecting to see a hand forcing its
way through the entrance flap, but there was nothing there.
“What?” he said, half angry, half re eester, Gabrielle? She never stops talking about ’Arry Potter.
She will be delighted to see you again.”
“Oh . . . is she here too?” Harry croaked.
“No, no, silly boy,” said Fleur with a tinkling laugh, “I mean next summer,
when we — but do you not know?”
Her great blue eyes widened and she looked reproachfully at Mrs. Weasley,
who said, “We hadn’t got around to telling him yet.”
Fleur turned back to Harry, swinging her silvery sheet of hair so that it
whipped Mrs. Weasley across the face.
“Bill and I are going to be married!”“Oh,” said Harry blankly. He could not help noticing how Mrs. Weasley,
Hermione, and Ginny were all determinedly avoiding one another’s gaze.
“Wow. Er — congratulations!”
She swooped down upon him and kissed him again.
“Bill is very busy at ze moment, working very ’ard, and I only work part-

— in truth, he now bore a distinct resemblance to Mad-Eye Moody, though
thankfully with both eyes and legs — but in personality he seemed just the
same as ever. All that appeared to have changed was that he now had a great
liking for very rare steaks.
“. . . so eet ees lucky ’e is marrying me,” said Fleur happily, plumping up
Bill’s pillows, “because ze British overcook their meat, I ’ave always said

“I suppose I’m just going to have to accept that he really is going to marry
her,” sighed Ginny later that evening, as she, Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat
beside the open window of the Gryffindor common room, looking out over
the twilit grounds.
“She’s not that bad,” said Harry. “Ugly, though,” he added hastily, as Ginny
raised her eyebrows, and she let out a reluctant giggle.

What are the names of Harry's children?,"James, Albus, and Lily",I do not know the names of Harry's children.,"idays. Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and their
son, Dudley, were Harry’s only living relatives. They were Muggles, and they
had a very medieval attitude toward magic. Harry’s dead parents, who had
been a witch and wizard themselves, were never mentioned under the
Dursleys’ roof. For years, Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon had hoped that if
they kept Harry as downtrodden as possible, they would be able to squash the
magic out of him. To their fury, they had been unsuccessful. These days they
lived in terror of anyone finding out that Harry had spent most of the last two
years at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The most they could
do, however, was to lock away Harry’s spellbooks, wand, cauldron, and
broomstick at the start of the summer break, and forbid him to talk to the
neighbors.
This separation from his spellbooks had been a real problem for Harry,
because his teachers at Hogwarts had given him a lot of holiday work. One of
the essays, a particularly nasty one about shrinking potions, was for Harry’  STATUS:

“Undesirable Number One,” Harry muttered under his breath as he
replaced Mr. Weasley’s folder and shut the drawer. He had an idea he knew
who that was, and sure enough, as he straightened up and glanced around the
office for fresh hiding places, he saw a poster of himself on the wall, with the
words 
UNDESIRABLE NO. 1
 emblazoned across his chest. A little pink note was
stuck to it with a picture of a kitten in the corner. Harry moved across to read
it and saw that Umbridge had written, 
“To be punished.”
Angrier than ever, he proceeded to grope in the bottoms of the vases and
baskets of dried flowers, b and ends up
setting fire to his bed.”
“I think he’s brilliant,” said Harry coldly.
“
Do
 you?” said the boy, with a slight sneer. “Why is he with you? Where
are your parents?”
“They’re dead,” said Harry shortly. He didn’t feel much like going into the
matter with this boy.
“Oh, sorry,” said the other, not sounding sorry at all. “But they were 
ourkind, weren’t they?”
“They were a witch and wizard, if that’s what you mean.”
“I really don’t think they should let the other sort in, do you? They’re just
not the same, they’ve never been brought up to know our ways. Some of them
have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine. I think
they should keep it in the old wizarding families. What’s your surname,
anyway?”
But before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, “That’s you done, my
dear,” and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped
down from the footstool.
“Well, I’ll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,” said the drawling boy.
Harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cre , or Hermione
Granger this time.
Three boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle one at once: It was
the pale boy from Madam Malkin’s robe shop. He was looking at Harry with
a lot more interest than he’d shown back in Diagon Alley.
“Is it true?” he said. “They’re saying all down the train that Harry Potter’s
in this compartment. So it’s you, is it?”
“Yes,” said Harry. He was looking at the other boys. Both of them were
thickset and looked extremely mean. Standing on either side of the pale boy,
they looked like bodyguards.
“Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle,” said the pale boy carelessly, noticing
where Harry was looking. “And my name’s Malfoy, Draco Malfoy.”
Ron gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a snigger. Draco
Malfoy looked at him.
“Think my name’s funny, do you? No need to ask who you are. My father
told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children than they
can afford.”
He turned back to Harry. “You’ll soon find out some wizarding families are
much better than oth d Lavender, who were closely followed by
Parvati and Padma Patil with (Harry’s stomach did a back flip) Cho and one
of her usually giggling girlfriends, then (on her own and looking so dreamy
that she might have walked in by accident) Luna Lovegood; then Katie Bell,
Alicia Spinnet, and Angelina Johnson, Colin and Dennis Creevey, Ernie
Macmillan, Justin Finch-Fletchley, Hannah Abbott, and a Hufflepuff girl with
a long plait down her back whose name Harry did not know; three Ravenclaw
boys he was pretty sure were called Anthony Goldstein, Michael Corner, and
Terry Boot; Ginny, followed by a tall skinny blond boy with an upturned nose
whom Harry recognized vaguely as being a member of the Hufflepuff
Quidditch team, and bringing up the rear, Fred and George Weasley with their
friend Lee Jordan, all three of whom were carrying large paper bags crammed
with Zonko’s merchandise.
“A couple of people?” said Harry hoarsely to Hermione. “A 
couple of
people
?”
“Yes, well, the idea seemed quite popular,” said Hermione ha turned a page loudly, and Dumbledore’s name leapt out at him. It was a
moment or two before he took in the meaning of the photograph, which
showed a family group. Beneath the photograph were the words:
 The
Dumbledore family, left to right: Albus; Percival, holding newborn Ariana;
Kendra; and Aberforth.
His attention caught, Harry examined the picture more carefully.
Dumbledore’s father, Percival, was a good-looking man with eyes that
seemed to twinkle even in this faded old photograph. The baby, Ariana, was
little longer than a loaf of bread and no more distinctive-looking. The mother,
Kendra, had jet-black hair pulled into a high bun. Her face had a carved
quality about it. Harry thought of photos of Native Americans he’d seen as he
studied her dark eyes, high cheekbones, and straight nose, formally composed
above a high-necked silk gown. Albus and Aberforth wore matching lacy
collared jackets and had identical, shoulder-length hairstyles. Albus looked
several years older, but otherwise the two boys looked  n his investigations
into his previously despised mother’s family — the woman whom, you will
remember, he had thought could not be a witch if she had succumbed to the
shameful human weakness of death.
“All he had to go upon was the single name ‘Marvolo,’ which he knew
from those who ran the orphanage had been his mother’s father’s name.
Finally, after painstaking research through old books of Wizarding families,
he discovered the existence of Slytherin’s surviving line. In the summer of his
sixteenth year, he left the orphanage to which he returned annually and set off
to find his Gaunt relatives. And now, Harry, if you will stand . . .”
Dumbledore rose, and Harry saw that he was again holding a small crystal
bottle filled with swirling, pearly memory.
“I was very lucky to collect this,” he said, as he poured the gleaming mass
into the Pensieve. “As you will understand when we have experienced it.
Shall we?”
Harry stepped up to the stone basin and bowed obediently until his face
sank through the surface of th ?” asked Harry, who found Ron just as
interesting as Ron found him.
“Er — yes, I think so,” said Ron. “I think Mum’s got a second cousin
who’s an accountant, but we never talk about him.”
“So you must know loads of magic already.”The Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale boy
in Diagon Alley had talked about.
“I heard you went to live with Muggles,” said Ron. “What are they like?”
“Horrible — well, not all of them. My aunt and uncle and cousin are,
though. Wish I’d had three wizard brothers.”
“Five,” said Ron. For some reason, he was looking gloomy. “I’m the sixth
in our family to go to Hogwarts. You could say I’ve got a lot to live up to. Bill
and Charlie have already left — Bill was head boy and Charlie was captain of
Quidditch. Now Percy’s a prefect. Fred and George mess around a lot, but
they still get really good marks and everyone thinks they’re really funny.
Everyone expects me to do as well as the others, but if I do, it’s no big deal,
because they did it first. You never g"
What is the name of the wand shop in Diagon Alley?,Ollivanders,The name of the wand shop in Diagon Alley is Ollivanders.,"most fascinating
Wizarding shops in the world, Harry felt no desire to break his word to Fudge
and stray back into the Muggle world.
Harry ate breakfast each morning in the Leaky Cauldron, where he liked
watching the other guests: funny little witches from the country, up for a day’s
shopping; venerable-looking wizards arguing over the latest article in
Transfiguration Today
; wild-looking warlocks; raucous dwarfs; and once,
what looked suspiciously like a hag, who ordered a plate of raw liver from
behind a thick woollen balaclava.
After breakfast Harry would go out into the backyard, take out his wand,
tap the third brick from the left above the trash bin, and stand back as the
archway into Diagon Alley opened in the wall.
Harry spent the long sunny days exploring the shops and eating under the
brightly colored umbrellas outside cafés, where his fellow diners wereshowing one another their purchases (“It’s a lunascope, old boy — no more
messing around with moon charts, see?”) or else discussing the case of Si anced at
Hermione and drew back into the shadows.
“Madam Lestrange,” murmured Tom, and as Hermione passed he inclined
his head subserviently.
“Good morning,” said Hermione, and as Harry crept past, still carrying
Griphook piggyback under the Cloak, he saw Tom look surprised.
“Too polite,” Harry whispered in Hermione’s ear as they passed out of the
inn into the tiny backyard. “You need to treat people like they’re scum!”“Okay, okay!”
Hermione drew out Bellatrix’s wand and tapped a brick in the nondescript
wall in front of them. At once the bricks began to whirl and spin: A hole
appeared in the middle of them, which grew wider and wider, finally forming
an archway onto the narrow cobbled street that was Diagon Alley.
It was quiet, barely time for the shops to open, and there were hardly any
shoppers abroad. The crooked, cobbled street was much altered now from the
bustling place Harry had visited before his first term at Hogwarts so many
years before. More shops than ever were boarded up, though several new
est e entrance
and paused, looking around.
Diagon Alley had changed. The colorful, glittering window displays of
spellbooks, potion ingredients, and cauldrons were lost to view, hidden behind
the large Ministry of Magic posters that had been pasted over them. Most of
these somber purple posters carried blown-up versions of the security advice
on the Ministry pamphlets that had been sent out over the summer, but others
bore moving black-and-white photographs of Death Eaters known to be on
the loose. Bellatrix Lestrange was sneering from the front of the nearest
apothecary. A few windows were boarded up, including those of Florean
Fortescue’s Ice Cream Parlor. On the other hand, a number of shabby-looking
stalls had sprung up along the street. The nearest one, which had been erected
outside Flourish and Blotts, under a striped, stained awning, had a cardboard
sign pinned to its front:AMULETS
Effective Against Werewolves, Dementors, and Inferi
A seedy-looking little wizard was rattling armfuls of silver symbols on
c cabbers was looking thinner than usual, and there was a definite droop to
his whiskers.
“There’s a magical creature shop just over there,” said Harry, who knew
Diagon Alley very well by now. “You could see if they’ve got anything for
Scabbers, and Hermione can get her owl.”
So they paid for their ice cream and crossed the street to the Magical
Menagerie.
There wasn’t much room inside. Every inch of wall was hidden by cages. It
was smelly and very noisy because the occupants of these cages were all
squeaking, squawking, jabbering, or hissing. The witch behind the counter
was already advising a wizard on the care of double-ended newts, so Harry,
Ron, and Hermione waited, examining the cages.
A pair of enormous purple toads sat gulping wetly and feasting on dead
blowflies. A gigantic tortoise with a jewel-encrusted shell was glittering near
the window. Poisonous orange snails were oozing slowly up the side of their
glass tank, and a fat white rabbit kept changing into a silk top hat and back
again with a loud po 
Diagon Alley. The goblin clung even tighter as they moved into the
compressing darkness, and seconds later Harry’s feet found pavement and he
opened his eyes on Charing Cross Road. Muggles bustled past wearing the
hangdog expressions of early morning, quite unconscious of the little inn’s
existence.
The bar of the Leaky Cauldron was nearly deserted. Tom, the stooped and
toothless landlord, was polishing glasses behind the bar counter; a couple of
warlocks having a muttered conversation in the far corner glanced at
Hermione and drew back into the shadows.
“Madam Lestrange,” murmured Tom, and as Hermione passed he inclined
his head subserviently.
“Good morning,” said Hermione, and as Harry crept past, still carrying
Griphook piggyback under the Cloak, he saw Tom look surprised.
“Too polite,” Harry whispered in Hermione’s ear as they passed out of the
inn into the tiny backyard. “You need to treat people like they’re scum!”“Okay, okay!”
Hermione drew out Bellatrix’s wand and tapped a brick in the nondescript
wa of the shop door.
Clutching his broken glasses to his face, Harry stared around. He had
emerged into a dingy alleyway that seemed to be made up entirely of shops
devoted to the Dark Arts. The one he’d just left, Borgin and Burkes, looked
like the largest, but opposite was a nasty window display of shrunken heads
and, two doors down, a large cage was alive with gigantic black spiders. Two
shabby-looking wizards were watching him from the shadow of a doorway,
muttering to each other. Feeling jumpy, Harry set off, trying to hold his
glasses on straight and hoping against hope he’d be able to find a way out of
here.
An old wooden street sign hanging over a shop selling poisonous candles
told him he was in Knockturn Alley. This didn’t help, as Harry had never
heard of such a place. He supposed he hadn’t spoken clearly enough through
his mouthful of ashes back in the Weasleys’ fire. Trying to stay calm, he
wondered what to do.
“Not lost are you, my dear?” said a voice in his ear, making him jump.
An aged witch stoo pect you’ve had a lotta
presents from them Dursleys. Just Ollivanders left now — only place fer
wands, Ollivanders, and yeh gotta have the best wand.”
A magic wand . . . this was what Harry had been really looking forward to.
The last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold letters over the door
read Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 
B.C.
 A single wand lay on a
faded purple cushion in the dusty window.
A tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped
inside. It was a tiny place, empty except for a single, spindly chair that Hagrid
sat on to wait. Harry felt strangely as though he had entered a very strict
library; he swallowed a lot of new questions that had just occurred to him and
looked instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to theceiling. For some reason, the back of his neck prickled. The very dust and
silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret magic.
“Good afternoon,” said a soft voice. Harry jumped. Hagrid must have
jumped, too, becaus ted. They peered into windows as they passed, but none of
the shops seemed to have any customers at all. Harry supposed it was a bit ofa giveaway in these dangerous and suspicious times to buy Dark artifacts —
or at least, to be seen buying them.
Hermione gave his arm a hard pinch.
“Ouch!”
“Shh! Look! He’s in there!” she breathed in Harry’s ear.
They had drawn level with the only shop in Knockturn Alley that Harry
had ever visited, Borgin and Burkes, which sold a wide variety of sinister
objects. There in the midst of the cases full of skulls and old bottles stood
Draco Malfoy with his back to them, just visible beyond the very same large
black cabinet in which Harry had once hidden to avoid Malfoy and his father.
Judging by the movements of Malfoy’s hands, he was talking animatedly. The
proprietor of the shop, Mr. Borgin, an oily-haired, stooping man, stood facing
Malfoy. He was wearing a curious expression of mingled resentment and fear.
“If only we could hear what they’re saying!” said Hermione.
“We can!” "
Who is the head of Slytherin House?,Severus Snape,"According to the text, the head of Slytherin House is Salazar Slytherin himself, who is also the last remaining descendant of Salazar Slytherin.","use

—

his own powers to you the night he gave you that scar. Not something he
intended to do, I’m sure. . . .”
“Voldemort put a bit of himself in 
me
?” Harry said, thunderstruck.
“It certainly seems so.”
“So I 
should 
be in Slytherin,” Harry said, looking desperately into
Dumbledore’s face. “The Sorting Hat could see Slytherin’s power in me, and
it —”
“Put you in Gryffindor,” said Dumbledore calmly. “Listen to me, Harry.
You happen to have many qualities Salazar Slytherin prized in his hand-
picked students. His own very rare gift, Parseltongue — 
resourcefulness —
determination — 
a certain disregard for rules,” he added, his mustache
quivering again. “Yet the Sorting Hat placed you in Gryffindor. You know
why that was. Think.”
“It only put me in Gryffindor,” said Harry in a defeated voice, “because I
asked not to go in Slytherin. . . .”
“Exactly,”
 said Du  you are here, your House will be something like
your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your
House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free time in your House
common room.
“The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and
Slytherin. Each House has its own noble history and each has produced
outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs
will earn your House points, while any rule-breaking will lose House points.
At the end of the year, the House with the most points is awarded the House
Cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever House
becomes yours.
“The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest
of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can
while you are waiting.”
Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville’s cloak, which was fastened
under his left ear, and on Ron’s smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to
flatten his hair.
“I shall return when we are r . .
“You all know, of course, that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years
ago — the precise date is uncertain — by the four greatest witches and
wizards of the age. The four school Houses are named after them: Godric
Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin.
They built this castle together, far from prying Muggle eyes, for it was an age
when magic was feared by common people, and witches and wizards suffered
much persecution.”
He paused, gazed blearily around the room, and continued.
“For a few years, the founders worked in harmony together, seeking out
youngsters who showed signs of magic and bringing them to the castle to be
educated. But then disagreements sprang up between them. A rift began to
grow between Slytherin and the others. Slytherin wished to be more 
selective
about the students admitted to Hogwarts. He believed that magical learning
should be kept within all-magic families. He disliked taking students ofMuggle parentage, believing them to be untrustworthy. Afte rom a doorway to the right — the
rest of the school must already be here — but Professor McGonagall showed
the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in,
standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering
about nervously.
“Welcome to Hogwarts,” said Professor McGonagall. “The start-of-term
banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall,
you will be sorted into your Houses. The Sorting is a very importantceremony because, while you are here, your House will be something like
your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your
House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free time in your House
common room.
“The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and
Slytherin. Each House has its own noble history and each has produced
outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs
will earn your House points, while any rule-breaking will lose House points.
At the end of the hen Slytherin House will have gained an excellent student, won’t it? It
doesn’t matter to us, Al. But if it matters to you, you’ll be able to choose
Gryffindor over Slytherin. The Sorting Hat takes your choice into account.”
“Really?”
“It did for me,” said Harry.
He had never told any of his children that before, and he saw the wonder in
Albus’s face when he said it. But now the doors were slamming all along the
scarlet train, and the blurred outlines of parents were swarming forward for
final kisses, last-minute reminders. Albus jumped into the carriage and Ginny
closed the door behind him. Students were hanging from the windows nearest
them. A great number of faces, both on the train and off, seemed to be turned
toward Harry.
“Why are they all 
staring
?” demanded Albus as he and Rose craned around
to look at the other students.
“Don’t let it worry you,” said Ron. “It’s me. I’m extremely famous.”
Albus, Rose, Hugo, and Lily laughed. The train began to move, and Harry
walked alongside it, watching his son’s   a Slytherin. Perhaps it was Harry’s
imagination, after all he’d heard about Slytherin, but he thought they looked
like an unpleasant lot.
He was starting to feel definitely sick now. He remembered being picked
for teams during gym at his old school. He had always been last to be chosen,
not because he was no good, but because no one wanted Dudley to think they
liked him.
“Finch-Fletchley, Justin!”
“HUFFLEPUFF!”
Sometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the House at once, but at
others it took a little while to decide. “Finnigan, Seamus,” the sandy-haired
boy next to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a whole minute
before the hat declared him a Gryffindor.
“Granger, Hermione!”
Hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head.
“GRYFFINDOR!” shouted the hat. Ron groaned.
A horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts always do when
you’re very nervous. What if he wasn’t chosen at all? What if he just sat there
with the hat over his eyes for ages, until Professor Mc  the Slytherins. Then
the Hufflepuffs stood, and almost at the same moment, the Ravenclaws, all of
them with their backs to Harry, all of them looking toward Pansy instead, and
Harry, awestruck and overwhelmed, saw wands emerging everywhere, pulled
from beneath cloaks and from under sleeves.
“Thank you, Miss Parkinson,” said Professor McGonagall in a clipped
voice. “You will leave the Hall first with Mr. Filch. If the rest of your House
could follow.”
Harry heard the grinding of benches and then the sound of the Slytherins
trooping out on the other side of the Hall.
“Ravenclaws, follow on!” cried Professor McGonagall.
Slowly the four tables emptied. The Slytherin table was completely
deserted, but a number of older Ravenclaws remained seated while their
fellows filed out; even more Hufflepuffs stayed behind, and half of Gryffindor
remained in their seats, necessitating Professor McGonagall’s descent from
the teachers’ platform to chivvy the underage on their way.
“Absolutely not, Creevey, go! 
And
 you, Peake go,and waiting, petrified, for its decision as it muttered aloud in his ear. For a
few horrible seconds he had feared that the hat was going to put him in
Slytherin, the House that had turned out more Dark witches and wizards than
any other — but he had ended up in Gryffindor, along with Ron, Hermione,
and the rest of the Weasleys. Last term, Harry and Ron had helped Gryffindor
win the House Championship, beating Slytherin for the first time in seven
years.
A very small, mousy-haired boy had been called forward to place the hat on
his head. Harry’s eyes wandered past him to where Professor Dumbledore, the
headmaster, sat watching the Sorting from the staff table, his long silver beard
and half-moon glasses shining brightly in the candlelight. Several seats along,
Harry saw Gilderoy Lockhart, dressed in robes of aquamarine. And there at
the end was Hagrid, huge and hairy, drinking deeply from his goblet.
“Hang on . . .” Harry muttered to Ron. “There’s an empty chair at the staff
table. . . . Where’s Snape?”

What potion grants good luck?,Felix Felicis,"According to the passage, the potion that grants good luck is called Felix Felicis, also known as ""liquid luck"". It makes the drinker lucky, but only if brewed correctly, and even then, it's recommended to use it sparingly to avoid negative side effects."," The potion
within was splashing about merrily; it was the color of molten gold, and large
drops were leaping like goldfish above the surface, though not a particle had
spilled.
“Oho,” said Slughorn again. Harry was sure that Slughorn had not
forgotten the potion at all, but had waited to be asked for dramatic effect.
“Yes. That. Well, 
that
 one, ladies and gentlemen, is a most curious little
potion called Felix Felicis. I take it,” he turned, smiling, to look at Hermione,
who had let out an audible gasp, “that you know what Felix Felicis does, Miss
Granger?”
“It’s liquid luck,” said Hermione excitedly. “It makes you lucky!”
The whole class seemed to sit up a little straighter. Now all Harry could see
of Malfoy was the back of his sleek blond head, because he was at last giving
Slughorn his full and undivided attention.
“Quite right, take another ten points for Gryffindor. Yes, it’s a funny little
potion, Felix Felicis,” said Slughorn. “Desperately tricky to make, and
disastrous to get wrong. However, if bre “that you know what Felix Felicis does, Miss

will find that all your endeavors tend to succeed . . . at least until the effects
wear off.”“Why don’t people drink it all the time, sir?” said Terry Boot eagerly.
“Because if taken in excess, it causes giddiness, recklessness, and
dangerous overconfidence,” said Slughorn. “Too much of a good thing, you
know . . . highly toxic in large quantities. But taken sparingly, and very
occasionally . . .”
“Have you ever taken it, sir?” asked Michael Corner with great interest.
“ morning. It was full of golden potion and the cork was still tightly
sealed with wax. “I wanted Ron to think I’d done it, so I faked it when I knew
you were looking.” He looked at Ron. “You saved everything because you felt
lucky. You did it all yourself.”
He pocketed the potion again.
“There really wasn’t anything in my pumpkin juice?” Ron said, astounded.
“But the weather’s good . . . and Vaisey couldn’t play. . . . I honestly haven’t
been given lucky potion?”
Harry shook his head. Ron gaped at him for a moment, then rounded on
Hermione, imitating her voice. “
You added Felix Felicis to Ron’s juice this
morning, that’s why he saved everything!
 See! I can save goals without help,
Hermione!”
“I never said you couldn’t — Ron, 
you
 thought you’d been given it too!”
But Ron had already strode past her out of the door with his broomstick
over his shoulder.
“Er,” said Harry into the sudden silence; he had not expected his plan to
backfire like this, “shall . . . shall we go up to the party, then?”
“You go!” said orn moved slowly among the tables, peering into cauldrons. He made
no comment, but occasionally gave the potions a stir or a sniff. At last he
reached the table where Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ernie were sitting. He
smiled ruefully at the tarlike substance in Ron’s cauldron. He passed over
Ernie’s navy concoction. Hermione’s potion he gave an approving nod. Then
he saw Harry’s, and a look of incredulous delight spread over his face.
“The clear winner!” he cried to the dungeon. “Excellent, excellent, Harry!
Good lord, it’s clear you’ve inherited your mother’s talent. She was a dab
hand at Potions, Lily was! Here you are, then, here you are — one bottle of
Felix Felicis, as promised, and use it well!”
Harry slipped the tiny bottle of golden liquid into his inner pocket, feeling
an odd combination of delight at the furious looks on the Slytherins’ faces and
guilt at the disappointed expression on Hermione’s. Ron looked simply
dumbfounded.
“How did you do that?” he whispered to Harry as they left the dungeon.
“Go ee him grinning.
“You know perfectly well what we’re talking about!” said Hermione
shrilly. “You spiked Ron’s juice with lucky potion at breakfast! Felix Felicis!”
“No, I didn’t,” said Harry, turning back to face them both.
“Yes you did, Harry, and that’s why everything went right, there were
Slytherin players missing and Ron saved everything!”“I didn’t put it in!” said Harry, grinning broadly. He slipped his hand inside
his jacket pocket and drew out the tiny bottle that Hermione had seen in his
hand that morning. It was full of golden potion and the cork was still tightly
sealed with wax. “I wanted Ron to think I’d done it, so I faked it when I knew
you were looking.” He looked at Ron. “You saved everything because you felt
lucky. You did it all yourself.”
He pocketed the potion again.
“There really wasn’t anything in my pumpkin juice?” Ron said, astounded.
“But the weather’s good . . . and Vaisey couldn’t play. . . . I honestly haven’t
been given lucky potion?”
Harry shook his head. Ron gaped at him for a  tart.”
Just as Harry, Ron, and Hermione had predicted, Snape could hardly have
set them a more difficult, fiddly potion. The ingredients had to be added to the
cauldron in precisely the right order and quantities; the mixture had to be
stirred exactly the right number of times, firstly in clockwise, then incounterclockwise directions; the heat of the flames on which it was
simmering had to be lowered to exactly the right level for a specific number
of minutes before the final ingredient was added.
“A light silver vapor should now be rising from your potion,” called Snape,
with ten minutes left to go.
Harry, who was sweating profusely, looked desperately around the
dungeon. His own cauldron was issuing copious amounts of dark gray steam;
Ron’s was spitting green sparks. Seamus was feverishly prodding the flames
at the base of his cauldron with the tip of his wand, as they had gone out. The
surface of Hermione’s potion, however, was a shimmering mist of silver
vapor, and as Snape swept by he looked down his hoo ed.
Harry shrugged and continued what he was doing. Seven stirs
counterclockwise, one clockwise, pause . . . seven stirs counterclockwise, one
stir clockwise . . .
Across the table, Ron was cursing fluently under his breath; his potion
looked like liquid licorice. Harry glanced around. As far as he could see, noone else’s potion had turned as pale as his. He felt elated, something that had
certainly never happened before in this dungeon.
“And time’s . . . up!” called Slughorn. “Stop stirring, please!”
Slughorn moved slowly among the tables, peering into cauldrons. He made
no comment, but occasionally gave the potions a stir or a sniff. At last he
reached the table where Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ernie were sitting. He
smiled ruefully at the tarlike substance in Ron’s cauldron. He passed over
Ernie’s navy concoction. Hermione’s potion he gave an approving nod. Then
he saw Harry’s, and a look of incredulous delight spread over his face.
“The clear winner!” he cried to the dungeon. “Excellent, excellent, Harry!
 oom.”
“Or someone who looked like a girl or a woman,” said Harry. “Don’t
forget, there was a cauldron full of Polyjuice Potion at Hogwarts. We know
some of it got stolen. . . .”
In his mind’s eye, he watched a parade of Crabbes and Goyles prance past,
all transformed into girls.
“I think I’m going to take another swig of Felix,” said Harry, “and have a
go at the Room of Requirement again.”“That would be a complete waste of potion,” said Hermione flatly, putting
down the copy of 
Spellman’s Syllabary
 she had just taken out of her bag.
“Luck can only get you so far, Harry. The situation with Slughorn was
different; you always had the ability to persuade him, you just needed to
tweak the circumstances a bit. Luck isn’t enough to get you through a
powerful enchantment, though. Don’t go wasting the rest of that potion!
You’ll need all the luck you can get if Dumbledore takes you along with him

“Couldn’t we make some more?” Ron asked Harry, ignoring Hermione.

important of all, it revealed the people inside the castle as minuscule, labeled
dots, moving around the corridors, so that Harry would be forewarned if
somebody was approaching the bathroom.
On Thursday night, Harry sneaked up to bed, put on the Cloak, crept backdownstairs, and, just as he had done on the night when Hagrid had shown him
the dragons, waited for the portrait hole to open. This time it was Ron who
waited outside to give the Fat Lady the password (“banana fritters”). “Good
luck,” Ron muttered, climbing into t M

It was a map showing every detail of the Hogwarts castle and grounds. But
the truly remarkable thing were the tiny ink dots moving around it, each
labeled with a name in minuscule writing. Astounded, Harry bent over it. A
labeled dot in the top left corner showed that Professor Dumbledore was
pacing his study; the caretaker’s cat, Mrs. Norris, was prowling the second
floor; and Peeves the Poltergeist was currently bouncing around the trophy
room. And as Harry’s eyes traveled up and down the familiar corridors, he
noticed something else.
This map showed a set of passages he had never entered. And many of
them seemed to lead —
“Right into Hogsmeade,” said Fred, tracing one of them with his finger.
“There are seven in all. Now, Filch knows about these four” — he pointed
them out — “but we’re sure we’re the only ones who know about 
these.
 Don’t
bother with the one behind the mirror on the fourth floor. We used it until last
winter, but it’s caved in — completely blocked. And we don’t reckon
an ed to stare at the map. Harry was burning to know more.
“Professor Moody?” he said again. “D’you think . . . could this have
anything to do with . . . maybe Mr. Crouch thinks there’s something going
on. . . .”
“Like what?” said Moody sharply.
Harry wondered how much he dare say. He didn’t want Moody to guess
that he had a source of information outside Hogwarts; that might lead to
tricky questions about Sirius.
“I don’t know,” Harry muttered, “odd stuff’s been happening lately, hasn’t
it? It’s been in the 
Daily Prophet
 . . . the Dark Mark at the World Cup, and the
Death Eaters and everything. . . .”
Both of Moody’s mismatched eyes widened.
“You’re a sharp boy, Potter,” he said. His magical eye roved back to the
Marauder’s Map. “Crouch could be thinking along those lines,” he said
slowly. “Very possible . . . there have been some funny rumors flying around
lately — helped along by Rita Skeeter, of course. It’s making a lot of people
nervous, I reckon.” A grim smile twisted his lopsided mouth. “Oh if there’s
o ed.
“Yeah . . . I — er . . . thanks,” said Harry weakly.
“What is this thing?” said Moody, drawing the Marauder’s Map out of his
pocket and unfolding it.
“Map of Hogwarts,” said Harry, hoping Moody was going to pull him out
of the staircase soon; his leg was really hurting him.
“Merlin’s beard,” Moody whispered, staring at the map, his magical eye
going haywire. “This . . . this is some map, Potter!”
“Yeah, it’s . . . quite useful,” Harry said. His eyes were starting to water
from the pain. “Er — Professor Moody, d’you think you could help me — ?”
“What? Oh! Yes . . . yes, of course . . .”
Moody took hold of Harry’s arms and pulled; Harry’s leg came free of the
trick step, and he climbed onto the one above it. Moody was still gazing at the
map.
“Potter . . .” he said slowly, “you didn’t happen, by any chance, to see who
broke into Snape’s office, did you? On this map, I mean?”
“Er . . . yeah, I did . . .” Harry admitted. “It was Mr. Crouch.”
Moody’s magical eye whizzed over the entire surface of the map. He
l s Harry had hoped, empty. He flung open his trunk
and began to rummage in it, while Ron watched impatiently.
“Harry . . .”“Malfoy’s using Crabbe and Goyle as lookouts. He was arguing with
Crabbe just now. I want to know — aha.”
He had found it, a folded square of apparently blank parchment, which he
now smoothed out and tapped with the tip of his wand.
“
I solemnly swear that I am up to no good
 . . . or Malfoy is anyway.”
At once, the Marauder’s Map appeared on the parchment’s surface. Here
was a detailed plan of every one of the castle’s floors and, moving around it,
the tiny, labeled black dots that signified each of the castle’s occupants.
“Help me find Malfoy,” said Harry urgently.
He laid the map upon his bed, and he and Ron leaned over it, searching.
“There!”
 said Ron, after a minute or so. “He’s in the Slytherin common
room, look . . . with Parkinson and Zabini and Crabbe and Goyle . . .”
Harry looked down at the map, disappointed, but rallied almost at once.
“Well, I’m keeping an eye on him from now e.
“It comes out somewhere different every day, so they’ve never been able to
find it,” he said. “Only trouble is, we never know exactly where we’re going
to end up when we go out. Be careful, Harry, they’re always patrolling the
corridors at night.”
“No problem,” said Harry. “See you in a bit.”
He and Luna hurried up the staircase, which was long, lit by torches, and
turned corners in unexpected places. At last they reached what appeared to be
solid wall.
“Get under here,” Harry told Luna, pulling out the Invisibility Cloak and
throwing it over both of them. He gave the wall a little push.
It melted away at his touch and they slipped outside: Harry glanced back
and saw that it had resealed itself at once. They were standing in a dark
corridor: Harry pulled Luna back into the shadows, fumbled in the pouch
around his neck, and took out the Marauder’s Map. Holding it close to his
nose he searched, and located his and Luna’s dots at last.
“We’re up on the fifth floor,” he whispered, watching Filch moving away
fr sion on Ron’s
face. Harry strode off through the heather, walking in a large circle with the
distraught Hermione at its center, casting the spells she usually performed to
ensure their protection.
They did not discuss Ron at all over the next few days. Harry was
determined never to mention his name again, and Hermione seemed to know
that it was no use forcing the issue, although sometimes at night when she
thought he was sleeping, he would hear her crying. Meanwhile Harry had
started bringing out the Marauder’s Map and examining it by wandlight. He
was waiting for the moment when Ron’s labeled dot would reappear in the
corridors of Hogwarts, proving that he had returned to the comfortable castle,
protected by his status of pureblood. However, Ron did not appear on the
map, and after a while Harry found himself taking it out simply to stare at
Ginny’s name in the girls’ dormitory, wondering whether the intensity with
which he gazed at it might break into her sleep, that she would somehow
know he was thinking a been disappearing off the map
— come to think of it, I’ve never seen the Room of Requirement on there!”
“Maybe the Marauders never knew the room was there,” said Ron.
“I think it’ll be part of the magic of the room,” said Hermione. “If you need
it to be Unplottable, it will be.”
“Dobby, have you managed to get in to have a look at what Malfoy’s
doing?” said Harry eagerly.
“No, Harry Potter, that is impossible,” said Dobby.
“No, it’s not,” said Harry at once. “Malfoy got into our headquarters there
last year, so I’ll be able to get in and spy on him, no problem.”
“But I don’t think you will, Harry,” said Hermione slowly. “Malfoy already
knew exactly how we were using the room, didn’t he, because that stupid
Marietta had blabbed. He needed the room to become the headquarters of the
D.A., so it did. But you don’t know what the room becomes when Malfoy
goes in there, so you don’t know what to ask it to transform into.”
“There’ll be a way around that,” said Harry dismissively. “You’ve done
brilliantly, Dobby.”
“Kr"
Who is the Triwizard champion from Beauxbatons?,Fleur Delacour,The Triwizard champion from Beauxbatons is not explicitly mentioned in this passage.,"oke. Nearly everyone laughed, and Dumbledore chuckled appreciatively.
“I am 
not
 joking, Mr. Weasley,” he said, “though now that you mention it, I
did hear an excellent one over the summer about a troll, a hag, and a
leprechaun who all go into a bar . . .”
Professor McGonagall cleared her throat loudly.
“Er — but maybe this is not the time . . . no . . .” said Dumbledore, “where
was I? Ah yes, the Triwizard Tournament . . . well, some of you will not know
what this tournament involves, so I hope those who 
do
 know will forgive me
for giving a short explanation, and allow their attention to wander freely.
“The Triwizard Tournament was first established some seven hundred years
ago as a friendly competition between the three largest European schools of
wizardry: Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, and Durmstrang. A champion was selected
to represent each school, and the three champions competed in three magical
tasks. The schools took it in turns to host the tournament once every five
years, and it was generally agreed to ds of years ago.
“There have been several attempts over the centuries to reinstate the
tournament,” Dumbledore continued, “none of which has been very
successful. However, our own Departments of International Magical
Cooperation and Magical Games and Sports have decided the time is ripe for
another attempt. We have worked hard over the summer to ensure that this
time, no champion will find himself or herself in mortal danger.
“The Heads of Beauxbatons and Durmstrang will be arriving with their
shortlisted contenders in October, and the selection of the three champions
will take place at Halloween. An impartial judge will decide which students
are most worthy to compete for the Triwizard Cup, the glory of their school,
and a thousand Galleons personal prize money.”
“I’m going for it!” Fred Weasley hissed down the table, his face lit with
enthusiasm at the prospect of such glory and riches. He was not the only
person who seemed to be visualizing himself as the Hogwarts champion. At
every House table, Harry coul  red, luminous stars on their hats, all
except Hagrid, who had his on the back of his moleskin vest.
“We are going to be patrolling the outside of the maze,” said Professor
McGonagall to the champions. “If you get into difficulty, and wish to be
rescued, send red sparks into the air, and one of us will come and get you, do
you understand?”
The champions nodded.
“Off you go, then!” said Bagman brightly to the four patrollers.
“Good luck, Harry,” Hagrid whispered, and the four of them walked awayin different directions, to station themselves around the maze. Bagman now
pointed his wand at his throat, muttered, 
“Sonorus,”
 and his magically
magnified voice echoed into the stands.
“Ladies and gentlemen, the third and final task of the Triwizard
Tournament is about to begin! Let me remind you how the points currently
stand! Tied in first place, with eighty-five points each — Mr. Cedric Diggory
and Mr. Harry Potter, both of Hogwarts School!” The cheers and applause
sent birds from the Forbidden Forest fluttering i directions, to station themselves around the maze. Bagman now
pointed his wand at his throat, muttered, 
“Sonorus,”
 and his magically
magnified voice echoed into the stands.
“Ladies and gentlemen, the third and final task of the Triwizard
Tournament is about to begin! Let me remind you how the points currently
stand! Tied in first place, with eighty-five points each — Mr. Cedric Diggory
and Mr. Harry Potter, both of Hogwarts School!” The cheers and applause
sent birds from the Forbidden Forest fluttering into the darkening sky. “In
second place, with eighty points — Mr. Viktor Krum, of Durmstrang
Institute!” More applause. “And in third place — Miss Fleur Delacour, of
Beauxbatons Academy!”
Harry could just make out Mrs. Weasley, Bill, Ron, and Hermione
applauding Fleur politely, halfway up the stands. He waved up at them, and
they waved back, beaming at him.
“So . . . on my whistle, Harry and Cedric!” said Bagman. “Three — two —
one —”
He gave a short blast on his whistle, and Harry and Cedric hurried forwar g
champion.
Predictably, Malfoy arrived at Hagrid’s cabin with his familiar sneer firmly
in place.
“Ah, look, boys, it’s the champion,” he said to Crabbe and Goyle themoment he got within earshot of Harry. “Got your autograph books? Better
get a signature now, because I doubt he’s going to be around much longer. . . .
Half the Triwizard champions have died . . . how long d’you reckon you’re
going to last, Potter? Ten minutes into the first task’s my bet.”
Crabbe and Goyle guffawed sycophantically, but Malfoy had to stop there,
because Hagrid emerged from the back of his cabin balancing a teetering
tower of crates, each containing a very large Blast-Ended Skrewt. To the
class’s horror, Hagrid proceeded to explain that the reason the skrewts had
been killing one another was an excess of pent-up energy, and that the
solution would be for each student to fix a leash on a skrewt and take it for a
short walk. The only good thing about this plan was that it distracted Malfoy
completely.
“Take this thing for a walk?” article about the Triwizard
Tournament — you know, when she made out you were the only Hogwarts
champion.”
“Didn’t bother to correct her, though, did he?” said Amos Diggory, loudly
enough for Harry to hear as he started to walk out of the door with Mrs.
Weasley and Bill. “Still . . . you’ll show him, Ced. Beaten him once before,
haven’t you?”
“Rita Skeeter goes out of her way to cause trouble, Amos!” Mrs. Weasley
said angrily. “I would have thought you’d know that, working at the
Ministry!”
Mr. Diggory looked as though he was going to say something angry, but his
wife laid a hand on his arm, and he merely shrugged and turned away.
Harry had a very enjoyable morning walking over the sunny grounds with
Bill and Mrs. Weasley, showing them the Beauxbatons carriage and the
Durmstrang ship. Mrs. Weasley was intrigued by the Whomping Willow,
which had been planted after she had left school, and reminisced at length
about the gamekeeper before Hagrid, a man called Ogg.
“How’s Percy?” Harry asked as they walked around  guide Harry Potter through the Triwizard Tournament without
appearing to do so. A servant who would watch over Harry Potter. Ensure he
reached the Triwizard Cup. Turn the Cup into a Portkey, which would take the
first person to touch it to my master. But first —”
“You needed Alastor Moody,” said Dumbledore. His blue eyes were
blazing, though his voice remained calm.
“Wormtail and I did it. We had prepared the Polyjuice Potion beforehand.
We journeyed to his house. Moody put up a struggle. There was a commotion.
We managed to subdue him just in time. Forced him into a compartment of
his own magical trunk. Took some of his hair and added it to the potion. I
drank it; I became Moody’s double. I took his leg and his eye. I was ready to
face Arthur Weasley when he arrived to sort out the Muggles who had heard a
disturbance. I made the dustbins move around the yard. I told Arthur Weasley
I had heard intruders in my yard, who had set off the dustbins. Then I packed
up Moody’s clothes and Dark Detectors, put them in ontenders in October, and the selection of the three champions
will take place at Halloween. An impartial judge will decide which students
are most worthy to compete for the Triwizard Cup, the glory of their school,
and a thousand Galleons personal prize money.”
“I’m going for it!” Fred Weasley hissed down the table, his face lit with
enthusiasm at the prospect of such glory and riches. He was not the only
person who seemed to be visualizing himself as the Hogwarts champion. At
every House table, Harry could see people either gazing raptly at
Dumbledore, or else whispering fervently to their neighbors. But then
Dumbledore spoke again, and the Hall quieted once more.
“Eager though I know all of you will be to bring the Triwizard Cup to
Hogwarts,” he said, “the Heads of the participating schools, along with the
Ministry of Magic, have agreed to impose an age restriction on contenders
this year. Only students who are of age — that is to say, seventeen years or
older — will be allowed to put forward their names f"
What is Voldemort's real name?,Tom Riddle,"According to the passage, Voldemort's real name is Tom Riddle.","rs of his name rearranged
themselves:
I AM LORD VOLDEMORT
“You see?” he whispered. “It was a name I was already using at Hogwarts,
to my most intimate friends only, of course. You think I was going to use my
filthy Muggle father’s name forever? I, in whose veins runs the blood of
Salazar Slytherin himself, through my mother’s side? I, keep the name of a
foul, common Muggle, who abandoned me even before I was born, just
because he found out his wife was a witch? No, Harry — I fashioned myself a
new name, a name I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak,when I had become the greatest sorcerer in the world!”
Harry’s brain seemed to have jammed. He stared numbly at Riddle, at the
orphaned boy who had grown up to murder Harry’s own parents, and so many
others. . . . At last he forced himself to speak.
“You’re not,” he said, his quiet voice full of hatred.
“Not what?” snapped Riddle.
“Not the greatest sorcerer in the world,” said Harry, breathing fast. “Sorry
to disappoint you and all that, but the grea self an impressive new
name — 
Lord
 Voldemort — the Half-Blood 
Prince —
 how could Dumbledore
have missed — ?”
He broke off, looking out the window. He could not stop himself dwelling
upon Dumbledore’s inexcusable trust in Snape . . . but as Hermione had just
inadvertently reminded him, he, Harry, had been taken in just the same. . . . Inspite of the increasing nastiness of those scribbled spells, he had refused to
believe ill of the boy who had been so clever, who had helped him so
much. . . .
Helped him
 . . . it was an almost unendurable thought now.
“I still don’t get why he didn’t turn you in for using that book,” said Ron.
“He must’ve known where you were getting it all from.”
“He knew,” said Harry bitterly. “He knew when I used Sectumsempra. He
didn’t really need Legilimency. . . . He might even have known before then,
with Slughorn talking about how brilliant I was at Potions. . . . Shouldn’t have
left his old book in the bottom of that cupboard, should he?”
“But why didn’t he turn you in?”
“I don’t  eleven years I have
been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name: 
Voldemort.
”
Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two
lemon drops, seemed not to notice. “It all gets so confusing if we keep saying
‘You-Know-Who.’ I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying
Voldemort’s name.”
“I know you haven’t,” said Professor McGonagall, sounding half
exasperated, half admiring. “But you’re different. Everyone knows you’re the
only one You-Know- oh, all right, 
Voldemort,
 was frightened of.”
“You flatter me,” said Dumbledore calmly. “Voldemort had powers I will
never have.”
“Only because you’re too — well — 
noble
 to use them.”
“It’s lucky it’s dark. I haven’t blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told
me she liked my new earmuffs.”
Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said, “The
owls are nothing next to the 
rumors
 that are flying around. You know what
everyone’s saying? About why he’s disappeared? About what finally stopped
him?”
It seemed  aving handed Voldemort a
goblet of wine and poured one for himself, he returned to the seat behind his
desk.
“So, Tom . . . to what do I owe the pleasure?”Voldemort did not answer at once, but merely sipped his wine.
“They do not call me ‘Tom’ anymore,” he said. “These days, I am known
as —”
“I know what you are known as,” said Dumbledore, smiling pleasantly.
“But to me, I’m afraid, you will always be Tom Riddle. It is one of the
irritating things about old teachers. I am afraid that they never quite forget
their charges’ youthful beginnings.”
He raised his glass as though toasting Voldemort, whose face remained
expressionless. Nevertheless, Harry felt the atmosphere in the room change
subtly: Dumbledore’s refusal to use Voldemort’s chosen name was a refusal to
allow Voldemort to dictate the terms of the meeting, and Harry could tell that
Voldemort took it as such.
“I am surprised you have remained here so long,” said Voldemort after a
short pause. “I always wondered why a wizard such as yourself never wished zard
of all time? How did 
you
 escape with nothing but a scar, while Lord
Voldemort’s powers were destroyed?”
There was an odd red gleam in his hungry eyes now.
“Why do you care how I escaped?” said Harry slowly. “Voldemort was
after your time. . . .”
“Voldemort,” said Riddle softly, “is my past, present, and future, Harry
Potter. . . .”
He pulled Harry’s wand from his pocket and began to trace it through the
air, writing three shimmering words:
TOM MARVOLO RIDDLE
Then he waved the wand once, and the letters of his name rearranged
themselves:
I AM LORD VOLDEMORT
“You see?” he whispered. “It was a name I was already using at Hogwarts,
to my most intimate friends only, of course. You think I was going to use my

“It certainly seems so,” said Dumbledore. “We have much to be thankful
for. Would you care for a lemon drop?”
“A

?”
“A lemon drop. They’re a kind of Muggle sweet I’m rather fond of.”
“No, thank you,” said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though she didn’t
think this was the moment for lemon drops. “As I say, even if You-Know-
Who 
has
 gone —”“My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by
his name? All this ‘You-Know-Who’ nonsense — for eleven years I have
been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name:

Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two
lemon drops, seemed not to notice. “It all gets so confusing if we keep saying

“I am surprised you have remained here so long,” said Voldemort after a
short pause. “I always wondered why a wizard such as yourself never wished
to leave school.”
“Well,” said Dumbledore, still smiling, “to a wizard such as myself, there
can be nothing more important than passing on ancient skills, helping hone
young minds. If I remember correctly, you once saw the attraction of teaching
too.”
“I see it still,” said Voldemort. “I merely wondered why you — who are so
often asked for advice by the Ministry, and who have twice, I think, been
offered the post of Minister —”
“Three times at the last count, actually,” said Dumbledore. “But the
Ministry n id Voldemort. “But I want there to be no
mistake in anybody’s mind. Harry Potter escaped me by a lucky chance. And
I am now going to prove my power by killing him, here and now, in front of

whispered, and the snake glided away through the grass to where the Death

his own weight before the ropes were untied. Wormtail raised his
new silver hand, pulled out the wad of material gagging Harry, and then, with
one swipe, cut through the bonds tying Harry to the gravestone.
There was a split second, perhaps, when Harry might have considered

What spell is used to produce light from a wand?,Lumos,"The spell used to produce light from a wand is not explicitly mentioned in this passage. However, it is mentioned that Dumbledore's wand was lit hastily as he went, and Ron's wand was also lit.

“The thing is,” whispered Hermione through the dark, “we could have
achieved that with Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder.”
There was a small 
click,
 and the ball of light from the lamp flew back to the
ceiling and illuminated them all once more.
“Still, it’s cool,” said Ron, a little defensively. “And from what they said,
Dumbledore invented it himself!”
“I know, but surely he wouldn’t have singled you out in his will just to help
us turn out the lights!”“D’you think he knew the Ministry would confiscate his will and examine
everything he’d left us?” asked Harry.
“Definitely,” said Hermione. “He couldn’t tell us in the will why he was
leaving us these things, but that still doesn’t explain . . .”
“. . . why he couldn’t have given us a hint when he was alive?” asked Ron.

An eerie sight met their eyes: They were standing on the edge of a great
black lake, so vast that Harry could not make out the distant banks, in a
cavern so high that the ceiling too was out of sight. A misty greenish light
shone far away in what looked like the middle of the lake; it was reflected in
the completely still water below. The greenish glow and the light from the
two wands were the only things that broke the otherwise velvety blackness,
though their rays did not penetrate as far as Harry would have expected. The
darkness was somehow denser than normal darkness.
“Let us walk,” said Dumbledore quietly. “Be very careful not to step into
the water. Stay close to me.”
He set off around the edge of the lake, and Harry followed close behind
him. Their footsteps made echoing, slapping sounds on the narrow rim of
rock that surrounded the water. On and on they walked, but the view did notvary: on one side of them, the rough cavern wall, on the other, the boundless
 eyes furious, fixed . . .and slowly, very slowly, the beads quivered to a halt, and then, just as slowly,
they began to move the other way . . . and it was Voldemort’s wand that was
vibrating extra-hard now . . . Voldemort who looked astonished, and almost
fearful. . . .
One of the beads of light was quivering, inches from the tip of Voldemort’s
wand. Harry didn’t understand why he was doing it, didn’t know what it
might achieve . . . but he now concentrated as he had never done in his life on
forcing that bead of light right back into Voldemort’s wand . . . and slowly . . .
very slowly . . . it moved along the golden thread . . . it trembled for a
moment . . . and then it connected. . . .
At once, Voldemort’s wand began to emit echoing screams of pain . . . then
— Voldemort’s red eyes widened with shock — a dense, smoky hand flew out
of the tip of it and vanished . . . the ghost of the hand he had made
Wormtail . . . more shouts of pain . . . and then something much larger began
to blossom from Voldemort’s w 
hands in the pockets of his robes.
“Hmm,” said Mr. Ollivander, “this is a Gregorovitch creation, unless I’m
much mistaken? A fine wandmaker, though the styling is never quite what
I . . . however . . .”
He lifted the wand and examined it minutely, turning it over and over
before his eyes.
“Yes . . . hornbeam and dragon heartstring?” he shot at Krum, who nodded.
“Rather thicker than one usually sees . . . quite rigid . . . ten and a quarter
inches . . . 
Avis!
”
The hornbeam wand let off a blast like a gun, and a number of small,
twittering birds flew out of the end and through the open window into the
watery sunlight.
“Good,” said Mr. Ollivander, handing Krum back his wand. “Which
leaves . . . Mr. Potter.”
Harry got to his feet and walked past Krum to Mr. Ollivander. He handed
over his wand.
“Aaaah, yes,” said Mr. Ollivander, his pale eyes suddenly gleaming. “Yes,
yes, yes. How well I remember.”
Harry could remember too. He could remember it as though it had
happened yesterday. . . .
Four summers ago, on his ing Voldemort.
Voldemort was ready. As Harry shouted, 
“Expelliarmus!”
 Voldemort cried,
“Avada Kedavra!”
A jet of green light issued from Voldemort’s wand just as a jet of red light
blasted from Harry’s — they met in midair — and suddenly Harry’s wand
was vibrating as though an electric charge were surging through it; his hand
seized up around it; he couldn’t have released it if he’d wanted to — and a
narrow beam of light connected the two wands, neither red nor green, but
bright, deep gold. Harry, following the beam with his astonished gaze, saw
that Voldemort’s long white fingers too were gripping a wand that was
shaking and vibrating.
And then — nothing could have prepared Harry for this — he felt his feet
lift from the ground. He and Voldemort were both being raised into the air,
their wands still connected by that thread of shimmering golden light. They
glided away from the tombstone of Voldemort’s father and then came to rest
on a patch of ground that was clear and free of graves. . . . The Death Eater lt a creeping chill behind him that could mean only
one thing. There was more than one.
“DUDLEY, KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT! WHATEVER YOU DO,
KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT! Wand!” Harry muttered frantically, his hands
flying over the ground like spiders. “Where’s — wand — come on —
Lumos!
”
He said the spell automatically, desperate for light to help him in his search
— and to his disbelieving relief, light flared inches from his right hand — the
wand-tip had ignited. Harry snatched it up, scrambled to his feet, and turned
around.
His stomach turned over.
A towering, hooded figure was gliding smoothly toward him, hovering over
the ground, no feet or face visible beneath its robes, sucking on the night as it
came.Stumbling backward, Harry raised his wand.
“Expecto Patronum!”
A silvery wisp of vapor shot from the tip of the wand and the dementor
slowed, but the spell hadn’t worked properly; tripping over his feet, Harry
retreated farther as the dementor bore down upon him, panic fogging his brain

A pair of g nted mirror, and R.A.B.’s locket. He pulled the strings
tight and slipped the purse around his neck, then sat holding the old Snitch
and watching its wings flutter feebly. At last, Hermione tapped on the door
and tiptoed inside.
“Muffliato,”
 she whispered, waving her wand in the direction of the stairs.
“Thought you didn’t approve of that spell?” said Ron.
“Times change,” said Hermione. “Now, show us that Deluminator.”
Ron obliged at once. Holding it up in front of him, he clicked it. The
solitary lamp they had lit went out at once.
“The thing is,” whispered Hermione through the dark, “we could have
achieved that with Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder.”
There was a small 
click,
 and the ball of light from the lamp flew back to the
ceiling and illuminated them all once more.
“Still, it’s cool,” said Ron, a little defensively. “And from what they said,
Dumbledore invented it himself!”
“I know, but surely he wouldn’t have singled you out in his will just to help
us turn out the lights!”“D’you think he knew the  You were found with a wand in your hand!” barked Mr. Diggory,
brandishing it in front of her. And as the wand caught the green light that was
filling the clearing from the skull above, Harry recognized it.
“Hey — that’s mine!” he said.
Everyone in the clearing looked at him.
“Excuse me?” said Mr. Diggory, incredulously.
“That’s my wand!” said Harry. “I dropped it!”
“You dropped it?” repeated Mr. Diggory in disbelief. “Is this a confession?
You threw it aside after you conjured the Mark?”
“Amos, think who you’re talking to!” said Mr. Weasley, very angrily. “Is
Harry Potter
 likely to conjure the Dark Mark?”
“Er — of course not,” mumbled Mr. Diggory. “Sorry . . . carried away . . .”“I didn’t drop it there, anyway,” said Harry, jerking his thumb toward the
trees beneath the skull. “I missed it right after we got into the wood.”
“So,” said Mr. Diggory, his eyes hardening as he turned to look at Winky
again, cowering at his feet. “You found this wand, eh, elf? And you picked it
up and thought you’d have some fun w"
What is the name of Hermione's cat?,Crookshanks,The name of Hermione's cat is Crookshanks.," Harry. The cat’s ginger fur was thick
and fluffy, but it was definitely a bit bowlegged and its face looked grumpy
and oddly squashed, as though it had run headlong into a brick wall. Now that
Scabbers was out of sight, however, the cat was purring contentedly in
Hermione’s arms.
“Hermione, that thing nearly scalped me!” said Ron.
“He didn’t mean to, did you, Crookshanks?” said Hermione.
“And what about Scabbers?” said Ron, pointing at the lump in his chest
pocket. “He needs rest and relaxation! How’s he going to get it with that thing
around?”
“That reminds me, you forgot your rat tonic,” said Hermione, slapping the
small red bottle into Ron’s hand. “And stop 
worrying,
 Crookshanks will be
sleeping in my dormitory and Scabbers in yours, what’s the problem? Poor
Crookshanks, that witch said he’d been in there for ages; no one wanted him.”
“I wonder why,” said Ron sarcastically as they set off toward the Leaky
Cauldron.
They found Mr. Weasley sitting in the bar, reading the 
Daily Prophet
.“Harry!” he said,  ssaging his head.
“What 
was
 that?”
“It was either a very big cat or quite a small tiger,” said Harry.
“Where’s Hermione?”
“Probably getting her owl —”
They made their way back up the crowded street to the Magical Menagerie.
As they reached it, Hermione came out, but she wasn’t carrying an owl. Her
arms were clamped tightly around the enormous ginger cat.
“You 
bought
 that monster?” said Ron, his mouth hanging open.
“He’s 
gorgeous,
 isn’t he?” said Hermione, glowing.
That was a matter of opinion, thought Harry. The cat’s ginger fur was thick
and fluffy, but it was definitely a bit bowlegged and its face looked grumpy
and oddly squashed, as though it had run headlong into a brick wall. Now that
Scabbers was out of sight, however, the cat was purring contentedly in
Hermione’s arms.
“Hermione, that thing nearly scalped me!” said Ron.
“He didn’t mean to, did you, Crookshanks?” said Hermione.
“And what about Scabbers?” said Ron, pointing at the lump in his chest

cat, Crookshanks, came pelting out of the garden, bottlebrush tail held high in
the air, chasing what looked like a muddy potato on legs. Harry recognized it
instantly as a gnome. Barely ten inches high, its horny little feet pattered very
fast as it sprinted across the yard and dived headlong into one of the
Wellington boots that lay scattered around the door. Harry could hear the
gnome giggling madly as Crookshanks inserted a paw into the boot, trying to
reach it. Meanwhile, a very loud crashing noise was coming from the other
side of the house. The source of the commotion was revealed as they entered
the garden, and saw that Bill and Charlie both had their wands out, and were
making two battered old tables fly high above the lawn, smashing into each
other, each attempting to knock the other’s out of the air. Fred and George
were cheering, Ginny was laughing, and Hermione was hovering near the
hedge, apparently torn between amusement and anxiet of Hermione’s stall.
“Hermione, come out, we’ve got loads to tell you —”
“Go away!” Hermione squeaked.
Harry and Ron looked at each other.
“What’s the matter?” said Ron. “You must be back to normal by now, we
are —”
But Moaning Myrtle glided suddenly through the stall door. Harry had
never seen her looking so happy.
“Ooooooh, wait till you see,” she said. “It’s 
awful
 —”
They heard the lock slide back and Hermione emerged, sobbing, her robes
pulled up over her head.
“What’s up?” said Ron uncertainly. “Have you still got Millicent’s nose or
something?”
Hermione let her robes fall and Ron backed into the sink.
Her face was covered in black fur. Her eyes had turned yellow and there
were long, pointed ears poking through her hair.
“It was a c-cat hair!” she howled. “M-Millicent Bulstrode m-must have a
cat! And the p-potion isn’t supposed to be used for animal transformations!”
“Uh-oh,” said Ron.
“You’ll be teased something 
dreadful
,” said Myrtle happily.
“It’s okay, Hermione,” said Harry quickly. “We’ll take y  you still got Millicent’s nose or

“It’s okay, Hermione,” said Harry quickly. “We’ll take you up to the

It took a long time to persuade Hermione to leave the bathroom. Moaning

THE VERY SECRET DIARY

flurry of rumor about her disappearance when the rest of the school
arrived back from their Christmas holidays, because of course everyone
thoug front
spotted the hanging cat. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood alone, in the middle
of the corridor, as silence fell among the mass of students pressing forward to
see the grisly sight.
Then someone shouted through the quiet.
“Enemies of the Heir, beware! You’ll be next, Mudbloods!”
It was Draco Malfoy. He had pushed to the front of the crowd, his cold eyes
alive, his usually bloodless face flushed, as he grinned at the sight of the
hanging, immobile cat.W
 
CHAPTER  NINE
THE WRITING ON THE WALL
hat’s going on here? What’s going on?”
Attracted no doubt by Malfoy’s shout, Argus Filch came
shouldering his way through the crowd. Then he saw Mrs. Norris and fell
back, clutching his face in horror.
“My cat! My cat! What’s happened to Mrs. Norris?” he shrieked.
And his popping eyes fell on Harry.
“You!”
 he screeched. “
You!
 You’ve murdered my cat! You’ve killed her!
I’ll kill you! I’ll —”
“Argus!”
Dumbledore had arrived on the scene, followed by a number of other
teachers. In seconds, he had swept past Harry, Ron, s about He-Who-Must-Not-Be-
Named?” Rita asked Hermione in a hushed voice.
“Yes, I do,” said Hermione. “The true story. All the facts. Exactly as Harry
reports them. He’ll give you all the details, he’ll tell you the names of the
undiscovered Death Eaters he saw there, he’ll tell you what Voldemort looks
like now — oh, get a grip on yourself,” she added contemptuously, throwing a
napkin across the table, for at the sound of Voldemort’s name, Rita had
jumped so badly that she had slopped half her glass of firewhisky down
herself.
Rita blotted the front of her grubby raincoat, still staring at Hermione. Then
she said baldly, “The 
Prophet 
wouldn’t print it. In case you haven’t noticed,
nobody believes his cock-and-bull story. Everyone thinks he’s delusional.
Now, if you let me write the story from that angle —”
“We don’t need another story about how Harry’s lost his marbles!” said
Hermione angrily. “We’ve had plenty of those already, thank you! I want him
given the opportunity to tell the truth!”
“There’s no m anks doesn’t understand it’s wrong!” said Hermione, her voice
shaking. “All cats chase rats, Ron!”
“There’s something funny about that animal!” said Ron, who was trying to
persuade a frantically wiggling Scabbers back into his pocket. “It heard me
say that Scabbers was in my bag!”
“Oh, what rubbish,” said Hermione impatiently. “Crookshanks could 
smell
him, Ron, how else d’you think —”
“That cat’s got it in for Scabbers!” said Ron, ignoring the people around
him, who were starting to giggle. “And Scabbers was here first, 
and
 he’s ill!”
Ron marched through the common room and out of sight up the stairs to
the boys’ dormitories.
Ron was still in a bad mood with Hermione next day. He barely talked to her
all through Herbology, even though he, Harry, and Hermione were working
together on the same puffapod.
“How’s Scabbers?” Hermione asked timidly as they stripped fat pink pods
from the plants and emptied the shining beans into a wooden pail.
“He’s hiding at the bottom of my bed, shaking,” said Ron angrily, miss"

first person to touch it to my master. But first —”
“You needed Alastor Moody,” said Dumbledore. His blue eyes were
blazing, though his voice remained calm.
“Wormtail and I did it. We had prepared the Polyjuice Potion beforehand.
We journeyed to his house. Moody put up a struggle. There was a commotion.
We managed to subdue him just in time. Forced him into a compartment of
his own magical trunk. Took some of his hair and added it to the potion. I
drank it; I became Moody’s double. I took his leg and his eye. I was ready to
face Arthur Weasley when he arrived to sort out the Muggles who had heard a
disturbance. I made the dustbins move around the yard. I told Arthur Weasley
I had heard intruders in my yard, who had set off the dustbins. Then I packed
up Moody’s clothes and Dark Detectors, put them in as though he were trapped
in a nightmare. He was fully aware that even if, by some miracle, he managed
to find a suitable spell, he’d have a real job mastering it overnight. How could
he have let this happen? Why hadn’t he got to work on the egg’s clue sooner?
Why had he ever let his mind wander in class — what if a teacher had once
mentioned how to breathe underwater?
He sat with Hermione and Ron in the library as the sun set outside, tearing
feverishly through page after page of spells, hidden from one another by the
massive piles of books on the desk in front of each of them. Harry’s heart
gave a huge leap every time he saw the word “water” on a page, but more
often than not it was merely “Take two pints of water, half a pound of
shredded mandrake leaves, and a newt . . .”
“I don’t reckon it can be done,” said Ron’s voice flatly from the other side
of the table. “There’s nothing. 
Nothing.
 Closest was that thing to dry up
puddles and ponds, that Drought Charm, but that was nowhere near powerful
enough to   magical power. The part of him that
was still dry was covered in goose pimples; half immersed in the icy water, a
cruel breeze lifting his hair, Harry started to shiver violently. He avoided
looking at the stands; the laughter was becoming louder, and there were
catcalls and jeering from the Slytherins. . . .
Then, quite suddenly, Harry felt as though an invisible pillow had been
pressed over his mouth and nose. He tried to draw breath, but it made his head
spin; his lungs were empty, and he suddenly felt a piercing pain on either side
of his neck —
Harry clapped his hands around his throat and felt two large slits just below
his ears, flapping in the cold air. . . . 
He had gills.
 Without pausing to think, he
did the only thing that made sense — he flung himself forward into the water.The first gulp of icy lake water felt like the breath of life. His head had
stopped spinning; he took another great gulp of water and felt it pass
smoothly through his gills, sending oxygen back to his brain. He stretched out ore, as he reached the boulder closest to the cliff
face. A thousand flecks of golden light sparkled upon the dark surface of the
water a few feet below where he crouched; the black wall of rock beside him
was illuminated too.
“You see?” said Dumbledore quietly, holding his wand a little higher. Harry
saw a fissure in the cliff into which dark water was swirling.
“You will not object to getting a little wet?”
“No,” said Harry.
“Then take off your Invisibility Cloak — there is no need for it now — and
let us take the plunge.”
And with the sudden agility of a much younger man, Dumbledore slid from
the boulder, landed in the sea, and began to swim, with a perfect breaststroke,
toward the dark slit in the rock face, his lit wand held in his teeth. Harry
pulled off his Cloak, stuffed it into his pocket, and followed.
The water was icy; Harry’s waterlogged clothes billowed around him and
weighed him down. Taking deep breaths that filled his nostrils with the tang
of salt and seaweed, he struck out for the shimmerin 
 he shouted, jabbing the goblet with his wand.
The goblet filled with clear water; Harry dropped to his knees beside
Dumbledore, raised his head, and brought the glass to his lips — but it was
empty. Dumbledore groaned and began to pant.
“But I had some — wait — 
Aguamenti!
” said Harry again, pointing his
wand at the goblet. Once more, for a second, clear water gleamed within it,
but as he approached Dumbledore’s mouth, the water vanished again.“Sir, I’m trying, I’m trying!” said Harry desperately, but he did not think
that Dumbledore could hear him; he had rolled onto his side and was drawing
great, rattling breaths that sounded agonizing. 
“Aguamenti — Aguamenti —
AGUAMENTI!”
The goblet filled and emptied once more. And now Dumbledore’s
breathing was fading. His brain whirling in panic, Harry knew, instinctively,
the only way left to get water, because Voldemort had planned it so . . .
He flung himself over to the edge of the rock and plunged the goblet into
the lake, bringing it up full to the brim of ic e headstone; he could see only what
was right in front of him.
Cedric’s body was lying some twenty feet away. Some way beyond him,
glinting in the starlight, lay the Triwizard Cup. Harry’s wand was on the
ground at Cedric’s feet. The bundle of robes that Harry had thought was a
baby was close by, at the foot of the grave. It seemed to be stirring fretfully.
Harry watched it, and his scar seared with pain again . . . and he suddenly
knew that he didn’t want to see what was in those robes . . . he didn’t want
that bundle opened. . . .He could hear noises at his feet. He looked down and saw a gigantic snake
slithering through the grass, circling the headstone where he was tied.
Wormtail’s fast, wheezy breathing was growing louder again. It sounded as
though he was forcing something heavy across the ground. Then he came
back within Harry’s range of vision, and Harry saw him pushing a stone
cauldron to the foot of the grave. It was full of what seemed to be water —
Harry could hear it slopping around — and it was  problem facing him:
how to survive underwater for an hour on the twenty-fourth of February.
Ron quite liked the idea of using the Summoning Charm again — Harry
had explained about Aqua-Lungs, and Ron couldn’t see why Harry shouldn’t
Summon one from the nearest Muggle town. Hermione squashed this plan by
pointing out that, in the unlikely event that Harry managed to learn how to
operate an Aqua-Lung within the set limit of an hour, he was sure to be
disqualified for breaking the International Code of Wizarding Secrecy — it
was too much to hope that no Muggles would spot an Aqua-Lung zooming
across the countryside to Hogwarts.
“Of course, the ideal solution would be for you to Transfigure yourself into
a submarine or something,” Hermione said. “If only we’d done human
Transfiguration already! But I don’t think we start that until sixth year, and it
can go badly wrong if you don’t know what you’re doing. . . .”
“Yeah, I don’t fancy walking around with a periscope sticking out of my
head,” said Harry. “I s’pose I d him.
“I’ve got to go and look for people who can’t use their voices above the
ground. . . .” he said slowly. “Er . . . who could that be?”
“Slow, aren’t you?”
He had never seen Moaning Myrtle so cheerful, apart from the day when a
dose of Polyjuice Potion had given Hermione the hairy face and tail of a cat.
Harry stared around the bathroom, thinking . . . if the voices could only be
heard underwater, then it made sense for them to belong to underwater
creatures. He ran this theory past Myrtle, who smirked at him.
“Well, that’s what Diggory thought,” she said. “He lay there talking to
himself for ages about it. Ages and ages . . . nearly all the bubbles had
gone. . . .”“Underwater . . .” Harry said slowly. “Myrtle . . . what lives in the lake,
apart from the giant squid?”
“Oh all sorts,” she said. “I sometimes go down there . . . sometimes don’t
have any choice, if someone flushes my toilet when I’m not expecting it. . . .”
Trying not to think about Moaning Myrtle zooming down a pipe to the lake
with the con"
Who killed Dumbledore?,Severus Snape,I do not know who killed Dumbledore. The question is not answered in this context.,"waited, but Dumbledore did not speak.
“I still don’t understand.”
“Voldemort tried to kill you when you were a child because of a prophecy
made shortly before your birth. He knew the prophecy had been made, though
he did not know its full contents. He set out to kill you when you were still a
baby, believing he was fulfilling the terms of the prophecy. He discovered, to
his cost, that he was mistaken, when the curse intended to kill you backfired.
And so, since his return to his body, and particularly since your extraordinary
escape from him last year, he has been determined to hear that prophecy in its
entirety. This is the weapon he has been seeking so assiduously since his
return: the knowledge of how to destroy you.”
The sun had risen fully now. Dumbledore’s office was bathed in it. The
glass case in which the sword of Godric Gryffindor resided gleamed white
and opaque, the fragments of the instruments Harry had thrown to the floor
glistened like raindrops, and behind him, the baby Fawkes made soft
chirru perhaps looking for
another body to share . . . not being truly alive, he cannot be killed. He left
Quirrell to die; he shows just as little mercy to his followers as his enemies.
Nevertheless, Harry, while you may only have delayed his return to power, it
will merely take someone else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing
battle next time — and if he is delayed again, and again, why, he may never
return to power.”
Harry nodded, but stopped quickly, because it made his head hurt. Then he
said, “Sir, there are some other things I’d like to know, if you can tell me . . .
things I want to know the truth about. . . .”
“The truth.” Dumbledore sighed. “It is a beautiful and terrible thing, and
should therefore be treated with great caution. However, I shall answer your
questions unless I have a very good reason not to, in which case I beg you’llforgive me. I shall not, of course, lie.”
“Well . . . Voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried to
stop him from killing me. But why would he wan , Harry. But — he couldn’t. He
couldn’t kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how, but they’re saying that
when he couldn’t kill Harry Potter, Voldemort’s power somehow broke —
and that’s why he’s gone.”
Dumbledore nodded glumly.
“It’s — it’s 
true
?” faltered Professor McGonagall. “After all he’s done . . .
all the people he’s killed . . . he couldn’t kill a little boy? It’s just
astounding . . . of all the things to stop him . . . but how in the name of heaven
did Harry survive?”
“We can only guess,” said Dumbledore. “We may never know.”
Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her
eyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a
golden watch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very odd watch. It had
twelve hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving around the
edge. It must have made sense to Dumbledore, though, because he put it back
in his pocket and said, “Hagrid’s late. I suppose it was he who told you I’d be
here, by the way?”
“Y s were directed only at Voldemort, who
had tampered so ill-advisedly with the deepest laws of magic. Only toward
him was that wand abnormally powerful. Otherwise it was a wand like any
other . . . though a good one, I am sure,” Dumbledore finished kindly.Harry sat in thought for a long time, or perhaps seconds. It was very hard to
be sure of things like time, here.
“He killed me with your wand.”
“He 
failed 
to kill you with my wand,” Dumbledore corrected Harry. “I
think we can agree that you are not dead — though, of course,” he added, as if
fearing he had been discourteous, “I do not minimize your sufferings, which I
am sure were severe.”
“I feel great at the moment, though,” said Harry, looking down at his clean,
unblemished hands. “Where are we, exactly?”
“Well, I was going to ask you that,” said Dumbledore, looking around.
“Where would you say that we are?”
Until Dumbledore had asked, Harry had not known. Now, however, he
found that he had an answer ready to give.
“It looks,” he said slowly, “like King’s  was Dumbledore’s spy
from the moment you threatened her, and he’s been working against you ever
since! Dumbledore was already dying when Snape finished him!”
“It matters not!” shrieked Voldemort, who had followed every word with
rapt attention, but now let out a cackle of mad laughter. “It matters not
whether Snape was mine or Dumbledore’s, or what petty obstacles they tried
to put in my path! I crushed them as I crushed your mother, Snape’s supposed
great 
love
! Oh, but it all makes sense, Potter, and in ways that you do not
understand!
“Dumbledore was trying to keep the Elder Wand from me! He intended that
Snape should be the true master of the wand! But I got there ahead of you,
little boy — I reached the wand before you could get your hands on it, I
understood the truth before you caught up. I killed Severus Snape three hours
ago, and the Elder Wand, the Deathstick, the Wand of Destiny is truly mine!
Dumbledore’s last plan went wrong, Harry Potter!”
“Yeah, it did,” said Harry. “You’re right. But before  d over his shoulder to where the small, maimed creature
trembled under the chair.
“What is that, Professor?”
“Something that is beyond either of our help,” said Dumbledore.
“But if Voldemort used the Killing Curse,” Harry started again, “and
nobody died for me this time — how can I be alive?”
“I think you know,” said Dumbledore. “Think back. Remember what he
did, in his ignorance, in his greed and his cruelty.”
Harry thought. He let his gaze drift over his surroundings. If it was indeed a
palace in which they sat, it was an odd one, with chairs set in little rows and
bits of railing here and there, and still, he and Dumbledore and the stunted
creature under the chair were the only beings there. Then the answer rose to
his lips easily, without effort.
“He took my blood,” said Harry.
“Precisely!” said Dumbledore. “He took your blood and rebuilt his living
body with it! Your blood in his veins, Harry, Lily’s protection inside both of
you! He tethered you to life while he lives!”
“I live . . . while he lives? But bly content.
“Explain,” said Harry.
“But you already know,” said Dumbledore. He twiddled his thumbs
together.
“I let him kill me,” said Harry. “Didn’t I?”
“You did,” said Dumbledore, nodding. “Go on!”“So the part of his soul that was in me . . .”
Dumbledore nodded still more enthusiastically, urging Harry onward, a
broad smile of encouragement on his face.
“. . . has it gone?”
“Oh yes!” said Dumbledore. “Yes, he destroyed it. Your soul is whole, and
completely your own, Harry.”
“But then . . .”
Harry glanced over his shoulder to where the small, maimed creature
trembled under the chair.
“What is that, Professor?”
“Something that is beyond either of our help,” said Dumbledore.
“But if Voldemort used the Killing Curse,” Harry started again, “and
nobody died for me this time — how can I be alive?”
“I think you know,” said Dumbledore. “Think back. Remember what he
did, in his ignorance, in his greed and his cruelty.”
Harry thought. He let his gaze drift over his surroundings. If it was indeed a
palace in which th ed his throat; it was dry from panic and the smoke.
“Hagrid, he killed . . .”
“Killed?” said Hagrid loudly, staring down at Harry. “Snape killed?
What’re yeh on abou’, Harry?”
“Dumbledore,” said Harry. “Snape killed . . . Dumbledore.”
Hagrid simply looked at him, the little of his face that could be seen
completely blank, uncomprehending.
“Dumbledore wha’, Harry?”
“He’s dead. Snape killed him. . . .”
“Don’ say that,” said Hagrid roughly. “Snape kill Dumbledore — don’ be
stupid, Harry. Wha’s made yeh say tha’?”
“I saw it happen.”
“Yeh couldn’ have.”
“I saw it, Hagrid.”
Hagrid shook his head; his expression was disbelieving but sympathetic,
and Harry knew that Hagrid thought he had sustained a blow to the head, that
he was confused, perhaps by the aftereffects of a jinx. . . .
“What musta happened was, Dumbledore musta told Snape ter go with
them Death Eaters,” Hagrid said confidently. “I suppose he’s gotta keep his
cover. Look, let’s get yeh back up ter the school. Come on, Harry. . . .”
Harry did not attempt "
What shape is Harry's scar?,A lightning bolt,"According to the text, Harry's scar is lightning-shaped.","steadily toward them between the graves. Harry couldn’t
make out a face, but from the way it was walking and holding its arms, he
could tell that it was carrying something. Whoever it was, he was short, and
wearing a hooded cloak pulled up over his head to obscure his face. And —
several paces nearer, the gap between them closing all the time — Harry saw
that the thing in the person’s arms looked like a baby . . . or was it merely a
bundle of robes?
Harry lowered his wand slightly and glanced sideways at Cedric. Cedric
shot him a quizzical look. They both turned back to watch the approaching
figure.
It stopped beside a towering marble headstone, only six feet from them. For
a second, Harry and Cedric and the short figure simply looked at one another.
And then, without warning, Harry’s scar exploded with pain. It was agony
such as he had never felt in all his life; his wand slipped from his fingers as he
put his hands over his face; his knees buckled; he was on the ground and he
could see nothing at all; his h arding world.
Harry looked nothing like the rest of the family. Uncle Vernon was large
and neckless, with an enormous black mustache; Aunt Petunia was horse-
faced and bony; Dudley was blond, pink, and porky. Harry, on the other hand,
was small and skinny, with brilliant green eyes and jet-black hair that was
always untidy. He wore round glasses, and on his forehead was a thin,
lightning-shaped scar.
It was this scar that made Harry so particularly unusual, even for a wizard.
This scar was the only hint of Harry’s very mysterious past, of the reason he
had been left on the Dursleys’ doorstep eleven years before.
At the age of one year old, Harry had somehow survived a curse from the
greatest Dark sorcerer of all time, Lord Voldemort, whose name most witches
and wizards still feared to speak. Harry’s parents had died in Voldemort’sattack, but Harry had escaped with his lightning scar, and somehow —
nobody understood why — Voldemort’s powers had been destroyed the
instant he had failed to kill Harry.
So Harry h e lightning scar on Harry’s forehead with a long,
white finger.
“I’m sorry to say I sold the wand that did it,” he said softly. “Thirteen-and-
a-half inches. Yew. Powerful wand, very powerful, and in the wrong
hands . . . well, if I’d known what that wand was going out into the world to
do. . . .”
He shook his head and then, to Harry’s relief, spotted Hagrid.
“Rubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you again. . . . Oak, sixteen
inches, rather bendy, wasn’t it?”
“It was, sir, yes,” said Hagrid.“Good wand, that one. But I suppose they snapped it in half when you got
expelled?” said Mr. Ollivander, suddenly stern.
“Er — yes, they did, yes,” said Hagrid, shuffling his feet. “I’ve still got the
pieces, though,” he added brightly.
“But you don’t use them?” said Mr. Ollivander sharply.
“Oh, no, sir,” said Hagrid quickly. Harry noticed he gripped his pink
umbrella very tightly as he spoke.
“Hmmm,” said Mr. Ollivander, giving Hagrid a piercing look. “Well, now
— Mr. Potter. Let me see.” He pulled a long tape measure w e only living creature in this house
who didn’t flinch at the sight of him.
Harry, though still rather small and skinny for his age, had grown a few
inches over the last year. His jet-black hair, however, was just as it always had
been — stubbornly untidy, whatever he did to it. The eyes behind his glasses
were bright green, and on his forehead, clearly visible through his hair, was a
thin scar, shaped like a bolt of lightning.
Of all the unusual things about Harry, this scar was the most extraordinary
of all. It was not, as the Dursleys had pretended for ten years, a souvenir of
the car crash that had killed Harry’s parents, because Lily and James Potter
had not died in a car crash. They had been murdered, murdered by the most
feared Dark wizard for a hundred years, Lord Voldemort. Harry had escaped
from the same attack with nothing more than a scar on his forehead, where
Voldemort’s curse, instead of killing him, had rebounded upon its originator.
Barely alive, Voldemort had fled. . . .
But Harry had come f scar again. It wasn’t the pain that bothered
him; Harry was no stranger to pain and injury. He had lost all the bones from
his right arm once and had them painfully regrown in a night. The same arm
had been pierced by a venomous foot-long fang not long afterward. Only last
year Harry had fallen fifty feet from an airborne broomstick. He was used to
bizarre accidents and injuries; they were unavoidable if you attended
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and had a knack for attracting a
lot of trouble.
No, the thing that was bothering Harry was that the last time his scar had
hurt him, it had been because Voldemort had been close by. . . . But
Voldemort couldn’t be here, now. . . . The idea of Voldemort lurking in Privet
Drive was absurd, impossible. . . .
Harry listened closely to the silence around him. Was he half-expecting to
hear the creak of a stair or the swish of a cloak? And then he jumped slightly
as he heard his cousin Dudley give a tremendous grunting snore from the next
room.
Harry shook him lled Harry Potter woke with a start.H
 
CHAPTER  TWO
THE SCAR
arry lay flat on his back, breathing hard as though he had been running.
He had awoken from a vivid dream with his hands pressed over his
face. The old scar on his forehead, which was shaped like a bolt of lightning,
was burning beneath his fingers as though someone had just pressed a white-
hot wire to his skin.
He sat up, one hand still on his scar, the other reaching out in the darkness
for his glasses, which were on the bedside table. He put them on and his
bedroom came into clearer focus, lit by a faint, misty orange light that was
filtering through the curtains from the street lamp outside the window.
Harry ran his fingers over the scar again. It was still painful. He turned on
the lamp beside him, scrambled out of bed, crossed the room, opened his
wardrobe, and peered into the mirror on the inside of the door. A skinny boy
of fourteen looked back at him, his bright green eyes puzzled under his untidy
black hair. He examined the lightning-bol ded
figure raised its head and looked right at Harry — unicorn blood was
dribbling down its front. It got to its feet and came swiftly toward Harry — he
couldn’t move for fear.
Then a pain like he’d never felt before pierced his head; it was as though
his scar were on fire. Half blinded, he staggered backward. He heard hooves
behind him, galloping, and something jumped clean over Harry, charging at
the figure.
The pain in Harry’s head was so bad he fell to his knees. It took a minute or
two to pass. When he looked up, the figure had gone. A centaur was standing
over him, not Ronan or Bane; this one looked younger; he had white-blond
hair and a palomino body.
“Are you all right?” said the centaur, pulling Harry to his feet.
“Yes — thank you — what 
was
 that?”
The centaur didn’t answer. He had astonishingly blue eyes, like pale
sapphires. He looked carefully at Harry, his eyes lingering on the scar that
stood out, livid, on Harry’s forehead.
“You are the Potter boy,” he said. “You had better get back to Hagrid  it. “If you’re telling the
truth, ugly, you’ve got nothing to fear from a trip to the Ministry. I expect
your father’ll reward us just for picking you up.”
“But,” said Harry, his mouth bone dry, “if you just let us —”
“Hey!” came a shout from inside the tent. “Look at this, Greyback!”
A dark figure came bustling toward them, and Harry saw a glint of silver in
the light of their wands. They had found Gryffindor’s sword.
“Ve-e-ry nice,” said Greyback appreciatively, taking it from his companion.
“Oh, very nice indeed. Looks goblin-made, that. Where did you get
something like this?”
“It’s my father’s,” Harry lied, hoping against hope that it was too dark for
Greyback to see the name etched just below the hilt. “We borrowed it to cut
firewood —”“’ang on a minute, Greyback! Look at this, in the 
Prophet
!”
As Scabior said it, Harry’s scar, which was stretched tight across his
distended forehead, burned savagely. More clearly than he could make out
anything around him, he saw a towering building, a grim fortress, "
Who are Harry's parents?,James and Lily Potter,"Harry's parents were James Potter and Lily Evans Potter, a witch and wizard themselves.","idays. Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and their
son, Dudley, were Harry’s only living relatives. They were Muggles, and they
had a very medieval attitude toward magic. Harry’s dead parents, who had
been a witch and wizard themselves, were never mentioned under the
Dursleys’ roof. For years, Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon had hoped that if
they kept Harry as downtrodden as possible, they would be able to squash the
magic out of him. To their fury, they had been unsuccessful. These days they
lived in terror of anyone finding out that Harry had spent most of the last two
years at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The most they could
do, however, was to lock away Harry’s spellbooks, wand, cauldron, and
broomstick at the start of the summer break, and forbid him to talk to the
neighbors.
This separation from his spellbooks had been a real problem for Harry,
because his teachers at Hogwarts had given him a lot of holiday work. One of
the essays, a particularly nasty one about shrinking potions, was for Harry’ n his investigations
into his previously despised mother’s family — the woman whom, you will
remember, he had thought could not be a witch if she had succumbed to the
shameful human weakness of death.
“All he had to go upon was the single name ‘Marvolo,’ which he knew
from those who ran the orphanage had been his mother’s father’s name.
Finally, after painstaking research through old books of Wizarding families,
he discovered the existence of Slytherin’s surviving line. In the summer of his
sixteenth year, he left the orphanage to which he returned annually and set off
to find his Gaunt relatives. And now, Harry, if you will stand . . .”
Dumbledore rose, and Harry saw that he was again holding a small crystal
bottle filled with swirling, pearly memory.
“I was very lucky to collect this,” he said, as he poured the gleaming mass
into the Pensieve. “As you will understand when we have experienced it.
Shall we?”
Harry stepped up to the stone basin and bowed obediently until his face
sank through the surface of th and ends up
setting fire to his bed.”
“I think he’s brilliant,” said Harry coldly.
“
Do
 you?” said the boy, with a slight sneer. “Why is he with you? Where
are your parents?”
“They’re dead,” said Harry shortly. He didn’t feel much like going into the
matter with this boy.
“Oh, sorry,” said the other, not sounding sorry at all. “But they were 
ourkind, weren’t they?”
“They were a witch and wizard, if that’s what you mean.”
“I really don’t think they should let the other sort in, do you? They’re just
not the same, they’ve never been brought up to know our ways. Some of them
have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine. I think
they should keep it in the old wizarding families. What’s your surname,
anyway?”
But before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, “That’s you done, my
dear,” and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped
down from the footstool.
“Well, I’ll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,” said the drawling boy.
Harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cre ?” asked Harry, who found Ron just as
interesting as Ron found him.
“Er — yes, I think so,” said Ron. “I think Mum’s got a second cousin
who’s an accountant, but we never talk about him.”
“So you must know loads of magic already.”The Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale boy
in Diagon Alley had talked about.
“I heard you went to live with Muggles,” said Ron. “What are they like?”
“Horrible — well, not all of them. My aunt and uncle and cousin are,
though. Wish I’d had three wizard brothers.”
“Five,” said Ron. For some reason, he was looking gloomy. “I’m the sixth
in our family to go to Hogwarts. You could say I’ve got a lot to live up to. Bill
and Charlie have already left — Bill was head boy and Charlie was captain of
Quidditch. Now Percy’s a prefect. Fred and George mess around a lot, but
they still get really good marks and everyone thinks they’re really funny.
Everyone expects me to do as well as the others, but if I do, it’s no big deal,
because they did it first. You never g f wizard pictures of his
mother and father. He sat down on his bed, drew the hangings around him,
and started turning the pages, searching, until . . .
He stopped on a picture of his parents’ wedding day. There was his father
waving up at him, beaming, the untidy black hair Harry had inheritedstanding up in all directions. There was his mother, alight with happiness, arm
in arm with his dad. And there . . . that must be him. Their best man . . . Harry
had never given him a thought before.
If he hadn’t known it was the same person, he would never have guessed it
was Black in this old photograph. His face wasn’t sunken and waxy, but
handsome, full of laughter. Had he already been working for Voldemort when
this picture had been taken? Was he already planning the deaths of the two
people next to him? Did he realize he was facing twelve years in Azkaban,
twelve years that would make him unrecognizable?
But the dementors don’t affect him,
 Harry thought, staring into the
handsome, laughing face. 
He doesn’t have t ou are Muggle-born?”
“Half-blood, sir,” said Riddle. “Muggle father, witch mother.”
“And are both your parents — ?”
“My mother died just after I was born, sir. They told me at the orphanage
she lived just long enough to name me — Tom after my father, Marvolo after
my grandfather.”
Dippet clucked his tongue sympathetically.
“The thing is, Tom,” he sighed, “special arrangements might have been
made for you, but in the current circumstances. . . .”
“You mean all these attacks, sir?” said Riddle, and Harry’s heart leapt, and
he moved closer, scared of missing anything.
“Precisely,” said the headmaster. “My dear boy, you must see how foolish it
would be of me to allow you to remain at the castle when term ends.
Particularly in light of the recent tragedy . . . the death of that poor little
girl. . . . You will be safer by far at your orphanage. As a matter of fact, the
Ministry of Magic is even now talking about closing the school. We are no
nearer locating the — er — source of all this unpleasantness. . . .”

“Undesirable Number One,” Harry muttered under his breath as he
replaced Mr. Weasley’s folder and shut the drawer. He had an idea he knew
who that was, and sure enough, as he straightened up and glanced around the
office for fresh hiding places, he saw a poster of himself on the wall, with the
words 
UNDESIRABLE NO. 1
 emblazoned across his chest. A little pink note was
stuck to it with a picture of a kitten in the corner. Harry moved across to read
it and saw that Umbridge had written, 
“To be punished.”
Angrier than ever, he proceeded to grope in the bottoms of the vases and
baskets of dried flowers, b , or Hermione
Granger this time.
Three boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle one at once: It was
the pale boy from Madam Malkin’s robe shop. He was looking at Harry with
a lot more interest than he’d shown back in Diagon Alley.
“Is it true?” he said. “They’re saying all down the train that Harry Potter’s
in this compartment. So it’s you, is it?”
“Yes,” said Harry. He was looking at the other boys. Both of them were
thickset and looked extremely mean. Standing on either side of the pale boy,
they looked like bodyguards.
“Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle,” said the pale boy carelessly, noticing
where Harry was looking. “And my name’s Malfoy, Draco Malfoy.”
Ron gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a snigger. Draco
Malfoy looked at him.
“Think my name’s funny, do you? No need to ask who you are. My father
told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children than they
can afford.”
He turned back to Harry. “You’ll soon find out some wizarding families are
much better than oth"
What spell is used to unlock doors?,Alohomora,"The spell used to unlock doors is ""Alohomora"".","CHARMS CORRIDOR!”Ducking under Peeves, they ran for their lives, right to the end of the
corridor where they slammed into a door — and it was locked.
“This is it!” Ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at the door, “We’re
done for! This is the end!”
They could hear footsteps, Filch running as fast as he could toward
Peeves’s shouts.
“Oh, move over,” Hermione snarled. She grabbed Harry’s wand, tapped the
lock, and whispered, 
“Alohomora!”
The lock clicked and the door swung open — they piled through it, shut it
quickly, and pressed their ears against it, listening.
“Which way did they go, Peeves?” Filch was saying. “Quick, tell me.”
“Say ‘please.’”
“Don’t mess with me, Peeves, now 
where did they go
?”
“Shan’t say nothing if you don’t say please,” said Peeves in his annoying
singsong voice.
“All right — 
please.
”
“NOTHING! Ha haaa! Told you I wouldn’t say nothing if you didn’t say
please! Ha ha! Haaaaaa!” And they heard the sound of Peeves whooshing
away and Filch cursing in rage.
“He thinks this door is lock  to pass without drawing attention to themselves. He expected to
encounter an obstacle at any moment; his worst fear was Peeves, and he
strained his ears with every step to hear the first, telltale signs of the
poltergeist’s approach.
“This way, Harry,” breathed Luna, plucking his sleeve and pulling him
toward a spiral staircase.
They climbed in tight, dizzying circles; Harry had never been up here
before. At last they reached a door. There was no handle and no keyhole:
nothing but a plain expanse of aged wood, and a bronze knocker in the shape
of an eagle.
Luna reached out a pale hand, which looked eerie floating in midair,
unconnected to arm or body. She knocked once, and in the silence it sounded
to Harry like a cannon blast. At once the beak of the eagle opened, but instead
of a bird’s call, a soft, musical voice said, “Which came first, the phoenix or
the flame?”
“Hmm . . . What do you think, Harry?” said Luna, looking thoughtful.
“What? Isn’t there just a password?”
“Oh no, you’ve got to answer a questi tant; yet it was almost empty but for a residue of old underwear,
sweets, empty ink bottles, and broken quills that coated the very bottom.
Nearby, on the floor, lay a purple leaflet emblazoned with the words:

“I’d rather not be interrupted,” said Scrimgeour shortly, “or watched,” he
added, pointing his wand at the windows, so that the curtains swept across
them. “Right, well, I’m a busy man, so let’s get down to business. First of all,
we need to discuss your security.”
The Prime Minister drew himself up to his fullest height and replied, “I am
perfectly happy with the security I’ve already got, thank you very —”
“Well, we’re not,” Scrimgeour cut in. “It’ll be a poor lookout for the
Muggles if their Prime Minister gets put under the Imperius Curse. The new
secretary in your outer office —”
“I’m not getting rid of Kingsley Shacklebolt, if that’s what you’re
suggesting!” said the Prime Minister hotly. “He’s highly efficient, gets
through twice the work the rest of them —”
“That’s because he’s a wizard,” said Scrimgeour, without a flicker of a
smile. “A highly trained Auror, who has been assigned to you for your
protection.”
“Now, wait a moment!” declared the Prime Minister. “You can’t just put

Harry stood motionless, staring through the open door at the dark upstairs
landing, straining his ears for further sounds, but none came. He hesitated for
a moment and then moved swiftly and silently out of his room to the head of
the stairs.
His heart shot upward into his throat. There were people standing in the
shadowy hall below, silhouetted against the streetlight glowing through the
glass door; eight or nine of them, all, as far as he could see, looking up at him.
“Lower your wand, boy, before you take someone’s eye out,” said a low,
growling voice.
Harry’s heart was thumping uncontrollably. He knew that voice, but he did
not lower his wand.
“Professor Moody?” he said uncertainly.
“I don’t know so much about ‘Professor,’” growled the voice, “never got
round to much teaching, did I? Get down here, we want to see you properly.”
Harry lowered his wand slightly but did not relax his grip on it, nor did he
move. He had very good reason to be suspicious. He had  understood why the Wizarding
community preferred Scrimgeour to Fudge as a leader in these dangerous
times.
“How do you do?” said the Prime Minister politely, holding out his hand.
Scrimgeour grasped it briefly, his eyes scanning the room, then pulled out a
wand from under his robes.
“Fudge told you everything?” he asked, striding over to the door and
tapping the keyhole with his wand. The Prime Minister heard the lock click.
“Er — yes,” said the Prime Minister. “And if you don’t mind, I’d rather
that door remained unlocked.”
“I’d rather not be interrupted,” said Scrimgeour shortly, “or watched,” he
added, pointing his wand at the windows, so that the curtains swept across
them. “Right, well, I’m a busy man, so let’s get down to business. First of all,
we need to discuss your security.”
The Prime Minister drew himself up to his fullest height and replied, “I am
perfectly happy with the security I’ve already got, thank you very —”
“Well, we’re not,” Scrimgeour cut in. “It’ll be a poor lookout for the
Muggles if PPARATE INSIDE THIS CASTLE!
THIS — HAS — SOMETHING — TO — DO — WITH — POTTER!”
“Severus — be reasonable — Harry has been locked up —”
BAM.
The door of the hospital wing burst open.
Fudge, Snape, and Dumbledore came striding into the ward. Dumbledore
alone looked calm. Indeed, he looked as though he was quite enjoyinghimself. Fudge appeared angry. But Snape was beside himself.
“OUT WITH IT, POTTER!” he bellowed. “WHAT DID YOU DO?”
“Professor Snape!” shrieked Madam Pomfrey. “Control yourself!”
“See here, Snape, be reasonable,” said Fudge. “This door’s been locked, we
just saw —”
“THEY HELPED HIM ESCAPE, I KNOW IT!” Snape howled, pointing at
Harry and Hermione. His face was twisted; spit was flying from his mouth.
“Calm down, man!” Fudge barked. “You’re talking nonsense!”
“YOU DON’T KNOW POTTER!” shrieked Snape. “HE DID IT, I KNOW
HE DID IT —”
“That will do, Severus,” said Dumbledore quietly. “Think about what you
are saying. This door has been locked since I left the ward ten minutes ago.
Madam Pomfrey, have th o you!”
There was no sound from within.
“If you don’t open the door, we’ll blast it open!” Harry said, pulling out his
wand.
“Harry!” said Hermione, sounding shocked. “You can’t possibly —”
“Yeah, I can!” said Harry. “Stand back —”
But before he could say anything else, the door flew open again as Harry
had known it would, and there stood Hagrid, glowering down at him and
looking, despite the flowery apron, positively alarming.
“I’m a teacher!” he roared at Harry. “A teacher, Potter! How dare yeh
threaten ter break down my door!”
“I’m sorry, 
sir,
” said Harry, emphasizing the last word as he stowed his
wand inside his robes.
Hagrid looked stunned. “Since when have yeh called me ‘sir’?”
“Since when have you called me ‘Potter’?”
“Oh, very clever,” growled Hagrid. “Very amusin’. That’s me outsmarted,
innit? All righ’, come in then, yeh ungrateful little . . .”
Mumbling darkly, he stood back to let them pass. Hermione scurried inafter Harry, looking rather frightened.
“Well?” said Hagrid grumpily, as Harry, Ron,"

where it began to cartwheel in circles. Moody jerked his wand, and the spider
rose onto two of its hind legs and went into what was unmistakably a tap
dance.
Everyone was laughing — everyone except Moody.
“Think it’s funny, do you?” he growled. “You’d like it, would you, if I did
it to you?”
The laughter died away almost instantly.
“Total control,” said Moody quietly as the spider balled itself up and began
to roll over and over. “I could make it jump out of the window, drown itself,
throw itself down one of your throats . . .”
Ron gave an involuntary shudder.
“Years back, there were a lot of witches and wizards being controlled by
the Imperius Curse,” said Moody, and Harry knew he was talking about the
days in which Voldemort had been all-powerful. “Some job for the Ministry,
trying to sort out who was being forced to act, and who was acting of their
own free will.
“The Imperius Curse can be fought, and I’ll be teaching you how, but it

“I’m not getting rid of Kingsley Shacklebolt, if that’s what you’re

“That’s because he’s a wizard,” said Scrimgeour, without a flicker of a
smile. “A highly trained Auror, who has been assigned to you for your

“Now, wait a moment!” declared the Prime Minister. “You can’t just put
your people into my office, I decide who works for me —”“I thought you were happy with Shacklebolt?” said Scrimgeour coldly.
“I am — that’s to say, I was —”
“Then there’s no problem, is there?” said Scrimgeour.
“I . . . well, as long as Shacklebolt’s work continues to be . . . er . . .
excellent,” said the Prime Minister lamely, but Scrimgeour barely seemed to
hear him.
“Now, about Herbert Chorley, your Junior Minister,” he continued. “The
one who has been entertaining the public by impersonating a duck.”
“Wha put the
Imperius Curse on him?”
“Don’t think it hadn’t occurred to us, Harry,” muttered Mr. Weasley. “But
Dumbledore thinks Fudge is acting of his own accord at the moment —
which, as Dumbledore says, is not a lot of comfort. . . . Best not talk about it
anymore just now, Harry . . .”
The doors slid open and they stepped out into the now almost-deserted
Atrium. Eric the security man was hidden behind his 
Daily Prophet
 again.
They had walked straight past the golden fountain before Harry remembered.
“Wait . . .” he told Mr. Weasley, and pulling his money bag from his pocket,
he turned back to the fountain.
He looked up into the handsome wizard’s face, but up close, Harry thought
he looked rather weak and foolish. The witch was wearing a vapid smile likea beauty contestant, and from what Harry knew of goblins and centaurs, they
were most unlikely to be caught staring this soppily at humans of any
description. Only the house-elf’s attitude of creeping servility looked
convincing. With a grin at the thought of  ne of your throats . . .”
Ron gave an involuntary shudder.
“Years back, there were a lot of witches and wizards being controlled by
the Imperius Curse,” said Moody, and Harry knew he was talking about the
days in which Voldemort had been all-powerful. “Some job for the Ministry,
trying to sort out who was being forced to act, and who was acting of their
own free will.
“The Imperius Curse can be fought, and I’ll be teaching you how, but it
takes real strength of character, and not everyone’s got it. Better avoid beinghit with it if you can. CONSTANT VIGILANCE!” he barked, and everyone
jumped.
Moody picked up the somersaulting spider and threw it back into the jar.
“Anyone else know one? Another illegal curse?”
Hermione’s hand flew into the air again and so, to Harry’s slight surprise,
did Neville’s. The only class in which Neville usually volunteered
information was Herbology, which was easily his best subject. Neville looked
surprised at his own daring.
“Yes?” said Moody, his magical eye rolling right over to e Dark Arts.
To their surprise, Professor Moody had announced that he would be putting
the Imperius Curse on each of them in turn, to demonstrate its power and to
see whether they could resist its effects.
“But — but you said it’s illegal, Professor,” said Hermione uncertainly as
Moody cleared away the desks with a sweep of his wand, leaving a large clear
space in the middle of the room. “You said — to use it against another human
was —”
“Dumbledore wants you taught what it feels like,” said Moody, his magical
eye swiveling onto Hermione and fixing her with an eerie, unblinking stare.
“If you’d rather learn the hard way — when someone’s putting it on you so
they can control you completely — fine by me. You’re excused. Off you go.”
He pointed one gnarled finger toward the door. Hermione went very pink
and muttered something about not meaning that she wanted to leave. Harry
and Ron grinned at each other. They knew Hermione would rather eat
bubotuber pus than miss such an important lesson.
Moody began to beckon  ished, she said nothing at all for a few moments, but stared with a kind of
painful intensity at Fred and George, who were both headless and selling their
magical hats from under their cloaks on the other side of the yard.
“So that’s why they killed him,” she said quietly, withdrawing her gaze
from Fred and George at last. “When Bode tried to steal this weapon,
something funny happened to him. I think there must be defensive spells on it,
or around it, to stop people from touching it. That’s why he was in St.
Mungo’s, his brain had gone all funny and he couldn’t talk. But remember
what the Healer told us? He was recovering. And they couldn’t risk him
getting better, could they? I mean, the shock of whatever happened when he
touched that weapon probably made the Imperius Curse lift. Once he’d got his
voice back, he’d explain what he’d been doing, wouldn’t he? They would
have known he’d been sent to steal the weapon. Of course, it would have been
easy for Lucius Malfoy to put the curse on him. Never out of the   — for that was the terrible power of the
dementors: to force their victims to relive the worst memories of their lives,
and drown, powerless, in their own despair. . . .
Moody was speaking again, from a great distance, it seemed to Harry. With
a massive effort, he pulled himself back to the present and listened to what
Moody was saying.“

words, and I doubt I’d get so much as a nosebleed. But that doesn’t matter.

“Now, if there’s no countercurse, why am I showing you? 
Because you’ve
got to know.
 You’ve got to appreciate what the worst is. You don’t want to
find yourself in a situation where you’re facing it. CONSTANT
VIGILANCE!” he roared, and the whole class jumped again.
“Now . . . those three curses —

Several hands rose tentatively into the air, including Ron’s and Hermione’s.
Moody pointed at Ron, though his magical eye was still fixed on Lavender.
“Er,” said Ron tentatively, “my dad told me about one. . . . Is it called theImperius Curse, or something?”
“Ah, yes,” said Moody appreciatively. “Your father 
would
 know that one.
Gave the Ministry a lot of trouble at one time, the Imperius Curse.”
Moody got heavily to his mismatched feet, opened his desk drawer, and
took out a glass jar. Three large black spiders were scuttling around inside it.
Harry felt Ron recoil slightly next to him — Ron hated spiders.
Moody reached into the jar, caught one of the spiders, and held it in the
palm of his hand so that they could all see it. He then pointed his wand at it
and muttered, 
“Imperio!”
The spider leapt from Moody’s hand on a fine thread of silk and began to
swing backward and forward as though on a trapeze. It stretched out its legs
rigidly, then did a back flip, breaking the thread and landing on the de"
Who teaches Transfiguration at Hogwarts?,Minerva McGonagall,Professor McGonagall teaches Transfiguration at Hogwarts.,"was a tiny little wizard who had to
stand on a pile of books to see over his desk. At the start of their first class he
took the roll call, and when he reached Harry’s name he gave an excited
squeak and toppled out of sight.
Professor McGonagall was again different. Harry had been quite right to
think she wasn’t a teacher to cross. Strict and clever, she gave them a talking-
to the moment they sat down in her first class.
“Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you
will learn at Hogwarts,” she said. “Anyone messing around in my class will
leave and not come back. You have been warned.”
Then she changed her desk into a pig and back again. They were all very
impressed and couldn’t wait to get started, but soon realized they weren’t
going to be changing the furniture into animals for a long time. After taking a
lot of complicated notes, they were each given a match and started trying to
turn it into a needle. By the end of the lesson, only Hermione Granger had
made any difference to her  rned how to take care of all the strange plants and fungi, and
found out what they were used for.Easily the most boring class was History of Magic, which was the only one
taught by a ghost. Professor Binns had been very old indeed when he had
fallen asleep in front of the staffroom fire and got up next morning to teach,
leaving his body behind him. Binns droned on and on while they scribbled
down names and dates, and got Emeric the Evil and Uric the Oddball mixed
up.
Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny little wizard who had to
stand on a pile of books to see over his desk. At the start of their first class he
took the roll call, and when he reached Harry’s name he gave an excited
squeak and toppled out of sight.
Professor McGonagall was again different. Harry had been quite right to
think she wasn’t a teacher to cross. Strict and clever, she gave them a talking-
to the moment they sat down in her first class.
“Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you
will learn at Hog ything else
we’ve got to do?”
All the fourth years had noticed a definite increase in the amount of work
they were required to do this term. Professor McGonagall explained why,
when the class gave a particularly loud groan at the amount of Transfiguration
homework she had assigned.
“You are now entering a most important phase of your magical education!”
she told them, her eyes glinting dangerously behind her square spectacles.
“Your Ordinary Wizarding Levels are drawing closer —”
“We don’t take O.W.L.s till fifth year!” said Dean Thomas indignantly.
“Maybe not, Thomas, but believe me, you need all the preparation you can
get! Miss Granger remains the only person in this class who has managed to
turn a hedgehog into a satisfactory pincushion. I might remind you that 
your
pincushion, Thomas, still curls up in fright if anyone approaches it with a
pin!”
Hermione, who had turned rather pink again, seemed to be trying not to
look too pleased with herself.
Harry and Ron were deeply amused when Professor Trelawney  particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into
something else, of course, it’s supposed to be very difficult —”; “You’ll be
starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing —”).
Harry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at the High
Table again. Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet. Professor
McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore. Professor Quirrell, in his
absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose,
and sallow skin.
It happened very suddenly. The hook-nosed teacher looked past Quirrell’s
turban straight into Harry’s eyes — and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar
on Harry’s forehead.
“Ouch!” Harry clapped a hand to his head.
“What is it?” asked Percy.
“N-nothing.”
The pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder to shake off was the
feeling Harry had gotten from the teacher’s look — a feeling that he didn’t
like Harry at all.
“Who’s that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?” he asked Percy.
 ng Secrecy — it
was too much to hope that no Muggles would spot an Aqua-Lung zooming
across the countryside to Hogwarts.
“Of course, the ideal solution would be for you to Transfigure yourself into
a submarine or something,” Hermione said. “If only we’d done human
Transfiguration already! But I don’t think we start that until sixth year, and it
can go badly wrong if you don’t know what you’re doing. . . .”
“Yeah, I don’t fancy walking around with a periscope sticking out of my
head,” said Harry. “I s’pose I could always attack someone in front of Moody;
he might do it for me. . . .”
“I don’t think he’d let you choose what you wanted to be turned into,
though,” said Hermione seriously. “No, I think your best chance is some sortof charm.”
So Harry, thinking that he would soon have had enough of the library to
last him a lifetime, buried himself once more among the dusty volumes,
looking for any spell that might enable a human to survive without oxygen.
However, though he, Ron, and Hermione searched through thei ay their books, and closed their bags. Even Ron was avoiding Harry’s eyes.
“Until we meet again,” said Professor Trelawney faintly, “fair fortune be
yours. Oh, and dear” — 
she pointed at Neville — “you’ll be late next time, so
mind you work extra-hard to catch up.”
Harry, Ron, and Hermione descended Professor Trelawney’s ladder and the
winding stair in silence, then set off for Professor McGonagall’s
Transfiguration lesson. It took them so long to find her classroom that, early
as they had left Divination, they were only just in time.
Harry chose a seat right at the back of the room, feeling as though he were
sitting in a very bright spotlight; the rest of the class kept shooting furtive
glances at him, as though he were about to drop dead at any moment. He
hardly heard what Professor McGonagall was telling them about Animagi
(wizards who could transform at will into animals), and wasn’t even watching
when she transformed herself in front of their eyes into a tabby cat with
spectacle markings around her eyes and Transfiguration too. Harry frequently looked over at
his classmates in the common room or at mealtimes to see them purple in the
face and straining as though they had overdosed on U-No-Poo; but he knew
that they were really struggling to make spells work without saying
incantations aloud. It was a relief to get outside into the greenhouses; they
were dealing with more dangerous plants than ever in Herbology, but at least
they were still allowed to swear loudly if the Venomous Tentacula seized
them unexpectedly from behind.One result of their enormous workload and the frantic hours of practicing
nonverbal spells was that Harry, Ron, and Hermione had so far been unable to
find time to go and visit Hagrid. He had stopped coming to meals at the staff
table, an ominous sign, and on the few occasions when they had passed him
in the corridors or out in the grounds, he had mysteriously failed to notice
them or hear their greetings.
“We’ve got to go and explain,” said Hermione, looking up at Hagrid’s huge
empty ch Transfigurationnext and I’ve got to pick up my books.”
He walked off, his mind still full of what Ernie had said about him.
“Justin’s been waiting for something like this to happen ever since he let
slip to Potter he was Muggle-born. . . .”
Harry stamped up the stairs and turned along another corridor, which was
particularly dark; the torches had been extinguished by a strong, icy draft that
was blowing through a loose windowpane. He was halfway down the passage
when he tripped headlong over something lying on the floor.
He turned to squint at what he’d fallen over and felt as though his stomach
had dissolved.
Justin Finch-Fletchley was lying on the floor, rigid and cold, a look of
shock frozen on his face, his eyes staring blankly at the ceiling. And that
wasn’t all. Next to him was another figure, the strangest sight Harry had ever
seen.
It was Nearly Headless Nick, no longer pearly-white and transparent, but
black and smoky, floating immobile and horizontal, six inches off the floor.
His head was half off "

well known. . . . Featured in a few Ministry leaflets lately too . . . Who can —
?”
Hermione’s hand was fastest once more.
“It’s Polyjuice Potion, sir,” she said.
Harry too had recognized the slow-bubbling, mudlike substance in the
second cauldron, but did not resent Hermione getting the credit for answering
the question; she, after all, was the one who had succeeded in making it, back
in their second year.
“Excellent, excellent! Now, this one here . . . yes, my dear?” said Slughorn,
now looking slightly bemused, as Hermione’s hand punched the air again.“It’s Amortentia!”
“It is indeed. It seems almost foolish to ask,” said Slughorn, who was
looking mightily impressed, “but I assume you know what it does?”
“It’s the most powerful love potion in the world!” said Hermione.
“Quite right! You recognized it, I suppose, by its distinctive mother-of-
pearl sheen?”
“And the steam rising in characteristic spirals,” said Hermione
enthusiastically, “and it’s supposed to smell differently to each of us,
according t see him, but
he seems in no immediate danger.”
Harry did as he was told; Dumbledore covered Moody in the cloak, tucked
it around him, and clambered out of the trunk again. Then he picked up the
hip flask that stood upon the desk, unscrewed it, and turned it over. A thick
glutinous liquid splattered onto the office floor.
“Polyjuice Potion, Harry,” said Dumbledore. “You see the simplicity of it,and the brilliance. For Moody never 
does
 drink except from his hip flask, he’s
well known for it. The imposter needed, of course, to keep the real Moody
close by, so that he could continue making the potion. You see his hair . . .”
Dumbledore looked down on the Moody in the trunk. “The imposter has been
cutting it off all year, see where it is uneven? But I think, in the excitement of
tonight, our fake Moody might have forgotten to take it as frequently as he
should have done . . . on the hour . . . every hour. . . . We shall see.”
Dumbledore pulled out the chair at the desk and sat down upon it, his eyes
fixed upon t  a witch
sprouting several extra pairs of arms out of her head.
“Here it is,” said Hermione excitedly as she found the page headed 
The
Polyjuice Potion.
 It was decorated with drawings of people halfway through
transforming into other people. Harry sincerely hoped the artist had imagined
the looks of intense pain on their faces.
“This is the most complicated potion I’ve ever seen,” said Hermione as
they scanned the recipe. “Lacewing flies, leeches, fluxweed, and knotgrass,”
she murmured, running her finger down the list of ingredients. “Well, they’re
easy enough, they’re in the student store-cupboard, we can help ourselves. . . .
Oooh, look, powdered horn of a bicorn — don’t know where we’re going to
get that — shredded skin of a boomslang — that’ll be tricky, too — and of
course a bit of whoever we want to change into.”
“Excuse me?” said Ron sharply. “What d’you mean, a bit of whoever we’re
changing into? I’m drinking 
nothing
 with Crabbe’s toenails in it —”
Hermione continued as though she hadn’t heard hi  better to do in Potions than listen to
Snape?” muttered Ron.
“It transforms you into somebody else. Think about it! We could change
into three of the Slytherins. No one would know it was us. Malfoy would
probably tell us anything. He’s probably boasting about it in the Slytherin
common room right now, if only we could hear him.”
“This Polyjuice stuff sounds a bit dodgy to me,” said Ron, frowning. “What
if we were stuck looking like three of the Slytherins forever?”
“It wears off after a while,” said Hermione, waving her hand impatiently.
“But getting hold of the recipe will be very difficult. Snape said it was in abook called 
Moste Potente Potions 
and it’s bound to be in the Restricted
Section of the library.”
There was only one way to get out a book from the Restricted Section: You
needed a signed note of permission from a teacher.
“Hard to see why we’d want the book, really,” said Ron, “if we weren’t
going to try and make one of the potions.”
“I think,” said Hermione, “that if we made it sound as though  rky brown.
“Hang on,” said Harry as Ron and Hermione reached for their glasses.
“We’d better not all drink them in here. . . . Once we turn into Crabbe and
Goyle we won’t fit. And Millicent Bulstrode’s no pixie.”
“Good thinking,” said Ron, unlocking the door. “We’ll take separate stalls.”
Careful not to spill a drop of his Polyjuice Potion, Harry slipped into the
middle stall.
“Ready?” he called.
“Ready,” came Ron’s and Hermione’s voices.
“One — two — three —”
Pinching his nose, Harry drank the potion down in two large gulps. It tasted
like overcooked cabbage.
Immediately, his insides started writhing as though he’d just swallowed live
snakes — doubled up, he wondered whether he was going to be sick — then a
burning sensation spread rapidly from his stomach to the very ends of his
fingers and toes — next, bringing him gasping to all fours, came a horrible
melting feeling, as the skin all over his body bubbled like hot wax — and
before his eyes, his hands began to grow, the fingers thickened, the nails
broaden  right minds would go, so they
were guaranteed some privacy. Moaning Myrtle was crying noisily in her
stall, but they were ignoring her, and she them.
Hermione opened 
Moste Potente Potions
 carefully, and the three of them
bent over the damp-spotted pages. It was clear from a glance why it belongedin the Restricted Section. Some of the potions had effects almost too
gruesome to think about, and there were some very unpleasant illustrations,
which included a man who seemed to have been turned inside out and a witch
sprouting several extra pairs of arms out of her head.
“Here it is,” said Hermione excitedly as she found the page headed 
The
Polyjuice Potion.
 It was decorated with drawings of people halfway through
transforming into other people. Harry sincerely hoped the artist had imagined
the looks of intense pain on their faces.
“This is the most complicated potion I’ve ever seen,” said Hermione as
they scanned the recipe. “Lacewing flies, leeches, fluxweed, and knotgrass,”
she murmured, running her finger g up at Hagrid. “The Polyjuice
Potion is designed for human use only.”
“None of the Order would have told Voldemort we were moving tonight,”
said Harry. The idea was dreadful to him, he could not believe it of any of
them. “Voldemort only caught up with me toward the end, he didn’t knowwhich one I was in the beginning. If he’d been in on the plan he’d have
known from the start I was the one with Hagrid.”
“Voldemort caught up with you?” said Lupin sharply. “What happened?
How did you escape?”
Harry explained briefly how the Death Eaters pursuing them had seemed to
recognize him as the true Harry, how they had abandoned the chase, how they
must have summoned Voldemort, who had appeared just before he and
Hagrid had reached the sanctuary of Tonks’s parents.
“They recognized you? But how? What had you done?”
“I . . .” Harry tried to remember; the whole journey seemed like a blur of
panic and confusion. “I saw Stan Shunpike. . . . You know, the bloke who was
the conductor on the Knight Bus? And I tried to Disarm h eep, pull out a few of their hairs and hide them in a
broom closet.”Harry and Ron looked incredulously at each other.
“Hermione, I don’t think —”
“That could go seriously wrong —”
But Hermione had a steely glint in her eye not unlike the one Professor
McGonagall sometimes had.
“The potion will be useless without Crabbe’s and Goyle’s hair,” she said
sternly. “You do 
want
 to investigate Malfoy, don’t you?”
“Oh, all right, all right,” said Harry. “But what about you? Whose hair are
you ripping out?”
“I’ve already got mine!” said Hermione brightly, pulling a tiny bottle out of
her pocket and showing them the single hair inside it. “Remember Millicent
Bulstrode wrestling with me at the Dueling Club? She left this on my robes
when she was trying to strangle me! And she’s gone home for Christmas —
so I’ll just have to tell the Slytherins I’ve decided to come back.”
When Hermione had bustled off to check on the Polyjuice Potion again,
Ron turned to Harry with a doom-laden expression.
“Have you ever heard of a plan "
What is the name of Voldemort's snake?,Nagini,The name of Voldemort's snake is Nagini.,"serpent, which relinquished its hold
upon Voldemort at once and turned, hissing furiously, to face Dumbledore.
Voldemort vanished. The snake reared from the floor, ready to strike —
There was a burst of flame in midair above Dumbledore just as Voldemort
reappeared, standing on the plinth in the middle of the pool where so recently
the five statues had stood.
“Look out!” 
Harry yelled.
But even as he shouted, one more jet of green light had flown at
Dumbledore from Voldemort’s wand and the snake had struck —
Fawkes swooped down in front of Dumbledore, opened his beak wide, and
swallowed the jet of green light whole. He burst into flame and fell to thefloor, small, wrinkled, and flightless. At the same moment, Dumbledore
brandished his wand in one, long, fluid movement — the snake, which had
been an instant from sinking its fangs into him, flew high into the air and
vanished in a wisp of dark smoke; the water in the pool rose up and covered
Voldemort like a cocoon of molten glass —
For a few seconds Voldemort w  snake emerged to climb slowly up Voldemort’s chair. It rose,
seemingly endlessly, and came to rest across Voldemort’s shoulders: its neck
the thickness of a man’s thigh; its eyes, with their vertical slits for pupils,
unblinking. Voldemort stroked the creature absently with long thin fingers,
still looking at Lucius Malfoy.
“Why do the Malfoys look so unhappy with their lot? Is my return, my riseto power, not the very thing they professed to desire for so many years?”
“Of course, my Lord,” said Lucius Malfoy. His hand shook as he wiped
sweat from his upper lip. “We did desire it — we do.”
To Malfoy’s left, his wife made an odd, stiff nod, her eyes averted from
Voldemort and the snake. To his right, his son, Draco, who had been gazing
up at the inert body overhead, glanced quickly at Voldemort and away again,
terrified to make eye contact.
“My Lord,” said a dark woman halfway down the table, her voice
constricted with emotion, “it is an honor to have you here, in our family’s
house. There can be no higher ple  Voldemort, who stood with his head bowed, and
his white hands folded over the Elder Wand in front of him. He might have
been praying, or else counting silently in his mind, and Harry, standing still
on the edge of the scene, thought absurdly of a child counting in a game of
hide-and-seek. Behind his head, still swirling and coiling, the great snake
Nagini floated in her glittering, charmed cage, like a monstrous halo.
When Dolohov and Yaxley rejoined the circle, Voldemort looked up.
“No sign of him, my Lord,” said Dolohov.
Voldemort’s expression did not change. The red eyes seemed to burn in the
firelight. Slowly he drew the Elder Wand between his long fingers.
“My Lord —”
Bellatrix had spoken: She sat closest to Voldemort, disheveled, her face a
little bloody but otherwise unharmed.
Voldemort raised his hand to silence her, and she did not speak anotherword, but eyed him in worshipful fascination.
“I thought he would come,” said Voldemort in his high, clear voice, his
eyes on the leaping flames. “I expected kill the snake, and the snake was where Voldemort was,
and Voldemort was at the end of this tunnel. . . .
“Harry, we’re coming, just get in there!” said Ron, pushing him forward.
Harry wriggled into the earthy passage hidden in the tree’s roots. It was a
much tighter squeeze than it had been the last time they had entered it. The
tunnel was low-ceilinged: They had had to double up to move through it
nearly four years previously; now there was nothing for it but to crawl. Harry
went first, his wand illuminated, expecting at any moment to meet barriers,
but none came. They moved in silence, Harry’s gaze fixed upon the swinging
beam of the wand held in his fist.
At last the tunnel began to slope upward and Harry saw a sliver of light
ahead. Hermione tugged at his ankle.
“The Cloak!” she whispered. “Put the Cloak on!”
He groped behind him and she forced the bundle of slippery cloth into his
free hand. With difficulty he dragged it over himself, murmured, 
“Nox,”
extinguishing his wandlight, and continued on his h our greatest weakness —”
Another jet of green light flew from behind the silver shield. This time it
was the one-armed centaur, galloping in front of Dumbledore, that took the
blast and shattered into a hundred pieces, but before the fragments had even
hit the floor, Dumbledore had drawn back his wand and waved it as though
brandishing a whip. A long thin flame flew from the tip; it wrapped itself
around Voldemort, shield and all. For a moment, it seemed Dumbledore had
won, but then the fiery rope became a serpent, which relinquished its hold
upon Voldemort at once and turned, hissing furiously, to face Dumbledore.
Voldemort vanished. The snake reared from the floor, ready to strike —
There was a burst of flame in midair above Dumbledore just as Voldemort
reappeared, standing on the plinth in the middle of the pool where so recently

“Look out!” 
Harry yelled.
But even as he shouted, one more jet of green light had flown at
Dumbledore from Voldemort’s wand and the snake had struck — ued to stand there, twirling the wand between his fingers,
staring at it.
“It is the only way, Nagini,” he whispered, and he looked around, and there
was the great thick snake, now suspended in midair, twisting gracefully
within the enchanted, protected space he had made for her, a starry,
transparent sphere somewhere between glittering cage and tank.
With a gasp, Harry pulled back and opened his eyes; at the same momenthis ears were assaulted with the screeches and cries, the smashes and bangs of
battle.
“He’s in the Shrieking Shack. The snake’s with him, it’s got some sort of
magical protection around it. He’s just sent Lucius Malfoy to find Snape.”
“Voldemort’s sitting in the Shrieking Shack?” said Hermione, outraged.
“He’s not — he’s not even 
fighting
?”
“He doesn’t think he needs to fight,” said Harry. “He thinks I’m going to go
to him.”
“But why?”
“He knows I’m after Horcruxes — he’s keeping Nagini close beside him —
obviously I’m going to have to go to him to get near the thing —”
“Right,” said Ron, s 
come a time when Lord Voldemort will seem to fear for the life of his snake.”
“For Nagini?” Snape looked astonished.
“Precisely. If there comes a time when Lord Voldemort stops sending that
snake forth to do his bidding, but keeps it safe beside him under magicalprotection, then, I think, it will be safe to tell Harry.”
“Tell him what?”
Dumbledore took a deep breath and closed his eyes.
“Tell him that on the night Lord Voldemort tried to kill him, when Lily cast
her own life between them as a shield, the Killing Curse rebounded upon
Lord Voldemort, and a fragment of Voldemort’s soul was blasted apart from
the whole, and latched itself onto the only living soul left in that collapsing
building. Part of Lord Voldemort lives inside Harry, and it is that which gives
him the power of speech with snakes, and a connection with Lord
Voldemort’s mind that he has never understood. And while that fragment of
soul, unmissed by Voldemort, remains attached to and protected by Harry,
Lord Voldemort cannot die.”

DUMBLEDORE’S GIANT MISTAKE
Albus Dumbledore, eccentric headmaster of Hogwarts School of
Witchcraft and Wizardry, has never been afraid to make
controversial staff appointments, 
writes Rita Skeeter, Special
Correspondent.
 In September of this year, he hired Alastor “Mad-
Eye” Moody, the notoriously jinx-happy ex-Auror, to teach Defense
Against the Dark Arts, a decision that caused many raised eyebrows
at the Ministry of Magic, given Moody’s well-known habit of
attacking anybody who makes a sudden movement in his presence.
Mad-Eye Moody, however, looks responsible and kindly when set
beside the part-human Dumbledore employs to teach Care ofMagical Creatures.
Rubeus Hagrid, who admits to being expelled from Hogwarts in
his third year, has enjoyed the position of gamekeeper at the school
ever since, a job secured for him by Dumbledore. Last year,
ho ace. The
picture was moving — the man was waving at the ceiling.
Rufus Scrimgeour, previously Head of the Auror office in the
Department of Magical Law Enforcement, has succeeded Cornelius
Fudge as Minister of Magic. The appointment has largely been greeted
with enthusiasm by the Wizarding community, though rumors of a rift
between the new Minister and Albus Dumbledore, newly reinstated
Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, surfaced within hours of Scrimgeour
taking office.
Scrimgeour’s representatives admitted that he had met with
Dumbledore at once upon taking possession of the top job, but refused to
comment on the topics under discussion. Albus Dumbledore is known to

Newly appointed Minister of Magic, Rufus Scrimgeour, spoke today of
the tough new measures taken by his Ministry to ensure the safety of
students returning to Hogwarts School of — Thingy.
“We urge the magical population to remain vigilant. The Ministry is
currently publishing guides to elementary home and personal defense
that will be delivered free to all Wizarding homes within the coming
month.”The Minister’s statement was met with dismay and alarm from the
Wizarding community, which as recently as last Wednesday was
receiving Ministry assurances that there was “no truth whatsoever in
these persistent rumors that You-Know-Who is operating amongst us
once more.”
Details of the events that led to the Ministry turnaround are still hazy,
though it is believed that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named and a select
band of followers (known as Death Eaters) gained entry to the Ministry
of Magic itself on Thursday evening.
Albus Dumbledore, newly reinstated headmaster of Hogwarts School

Wizengamot, was unavailable for comment last night. He has insisted for

A second newspaper lay beside the first. This one bore the headline:
SCRIMGEOUR SUCCEEDS FUDGE
Most of this front page was taken up with a large black-and-white picture
of a man with a lionlike mane of thick hair and a rather ravaged face. The
picture was moving — the man was waving at the ceiling.
Rufus Scrimgeour, previously Head of the Auror office in the
Department of Magical Law Enforcement, has succeeded Cornelius
Fudge as Minister of Magic. The appointment has largely been greeted
with enthusiasm by the Wizarding community, though rumors of a rift
between the new Minister and Albus Dumbledore, newly reinstated
Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, surfaced within hours of Scrimgeour
taking office.
Scrimgeour’s representatives admitted  red
parchment.
A large picture of a familiar, hook-nosed, black-haired man stared up at
them all, beneath a headline that read:
SEVERUS SNAPE CONFIRMED AS HOGWARTS HEADMASTER
“No!” said Ron and Hermione loudly.
Hermione was quickest; she snatched up the newspaper and began to read
the accompanying story out loud.
“‘Severus Snape, long-standing Potions master at Hogwarts School of
Witchcraft and Wizardry, was today appointed headmaster in the most
important of several staffing changes at the ancient school. Following the
resignation of the previous Muggle Studies teacher, Alecto Carrow will take
over the post while her brother, Amycus, fills the position of Defense Against
the Dark Arts professor.
“
‘I welcome the opportunity to uphold our finest Wizarding traditions and
values —’ 
Like committing murder and cutting off people’s ears, I suppose!
Snape, headmaster! Snape in Dumbledore’s study — Merlin’s pants!” she
shrieked, making both Harry and Ron jump. She leapt up from the table and
hurtled from the room,  dunno . . . Hogwarts without Dumbledore . . .” He gulped and
disappeared behind his handkerchief once more, and there was silence.
“Very well,” said Professor McGonagall, glancing out of the window at thegrounds, checking to see whether the Minister was yet approaching, “then I
must agree with Filius that the right thing to do is to consult the governors,
who will make the final decision.
“Now, as to getting students home . . . there is an argument for doing it
sooner rather than later. We could arrange for the Hogwarts Express to come
tomorrow if necessary —”
“What about Dumbledore’s funeral?” said Harry, speaking at last.
“Well . . .” said Professor McGonagall, losing a little of her briskness as her
voice shook. “I — I know that it was Dumbledore’s wish to be laid to rest
here, at Hogwarts —”
“Then that’s what’ll happen, isn’t it?” said Harry fiercely.
“If the Ministry thinks it appropriate,” said Professor McGonagall. “No
other headmaster or headmistress has ever been —”
“No other headmaster or headmistre"
What does the Mirror of Erised show?,The deepest desire of one's heart,"According to the text, the Mirror of Erised shows us what we most deeply and desperately desire. It shows us the things we want most in life, whether it's seeing our family standing around us, being the best of our siblings, or achieving a particular goal.","ized by now what it does?”
“It — well — it shows me my family —”
“And it showed your friend Ron himself as Head Boy.”
“How did you know — ?”
“I don’t need a cloak to become invisible,” said Dumbledore gently. “Now,
can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?”
Harry shook his head.
“Let me explain. The happiest man on earth would be able to use the
Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it and see
himself exactly as he is. Does that help?”
Harry thought. Then he said slowly, “It shows us what we want . . .
whatever we want . . .”
“Yes and no,” said Dumbledore quietly. “It shows us nothing more or less
than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts. You, who have never
known your family, see them standing around you. Ronald Weasley, who has
always been overshadowed by his brothers, sees himself standing alone, the
best of all of them. However, this mirror will give us neither knowledge or
truth. Men have wasted away before it, entranced by what they have seen, or
bee e other than Albus
Dumbledore. Harry must have walked straight past him, so desperate to get to
the mirror he hadn’t noticed him.“I — I didn’t see you, sir.”
“Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you,” said Dumbledore,
and Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling.
“So,” said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with Harry,
“you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of
Erised.”
“I didn’t know it was called that, sir.”
“But I expect you’ve realized by now what it does?”
“It — well — it shows me my family —”
“And it showed your friend Ron himself as Head Boy.”
“How did you know — ?”
“I don’t need a cloak to become invisible,” said Dumbledore gently. “Now,
can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?”
Harry shook his head.
“Let me explain. The happiest man on earth would be able to use the
Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it and see
himself exactly as he is. Does that help?”
Harry thought. Then he said slo otter. I need to examine this interesting mirror.”
It was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell. It
was the Mirror of Erised.
“This mirror is the key to finding the Stone,” Quirrell murmured, tapping
his way around the frame. “Trust Dumbledore to come up with something like
this . . . but he’s in London . . . I’ll be far away by the time he gets back. . . .”
All Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and stop him
from concentrating on the mirror.
“I saw you and Snape in the forest —” he blurted out.
“Yes,” said Quirrell idly, walking around the mirror to look at the back.
“He was on to me by that time, trying to find out how far I’d got. He
suspected me all along. Tried to frighten me — as though he could, when I
had Lord Voldemort on my side. . . .”Quirrell came back out from behind the mirror and stared hungrily into it.
“I see the Stone . . . I’m presenting it to my master . . . but where is it?”
Harry struggled against the ropes binding him, but they didn’t give. wly, “It shows us what we want . . .
whatever we want . . .”
“Yes and no,” said Dumbledore quietly. “It shows us nothing more or less
than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts. You, who have never
known your family, see them standing around you. Ronald Weasley, who has
always been overshadowed by his brothers, sees himself standing alone, the
best of all of them. However, this mirror will give us neither knowledge or
truth. Men have wasted away before it, entranced by what they have seen, or
been driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible.
“The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow, Harry, and I ask you
not to go looking for it again. If you ever 
do
 run across it, you will now be
prepared. It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, remember that.
Now, why don’t you put that admirable Cloak back on and get off to bed?”Harry stood up.
“Sir — Professor Dumbledore? Can I ask you something?”
“Obviously, you’ve just done so,” Dumbledore smiled. “You may ask me
o  trick was that it reflected them,invisible or not?
He looked in the mirror again. A woman standing right behind his
reflection was smiling at him and waving. He reached out a hand and felt the
air behind him. If she was really there, he’d touch her, their reflections were
so close together, but he felt only air — she and the others existed only in the
mirror.
She was a very pretty woman. She had dark red hair and her eyes — 
her
eyes are just like mine,
 Harry thought, edging a little closer to the glass.
Bright green — exactly the same shape, but then he noticed that she was
crying; smiling, but crying at the same time. The tall, thin, black-haired man
standing next to her put his arm around her. He wore glasses, and his hair was
very untidy. It stuck up at the back, just as Harry’s did.
Harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching that
of his reflection.
“Mum?” he whispered. “Dad?”
They just looked at him, smiling. And slowly, Harry looked into the faces
of the other people in the n driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible.
“The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow, Harry, and I ask you
not to go looking for it again. If you ever 
do

prepared. It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, remember that.
Now, why don’t you put that admirable Cloak back on and get off to bed?”Harry stood up.
“Sir — Professor Dumbledore? Can I ask you something?”
“Obviously, you’ve just done so,” Dumbledore smiled. “You may ask me
one more thing, however.”
“What do you see when you look in the mirror?”
“I? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.”
Harry stared.
“One can never have enough socks,” said Dumbledore. “Another Christmas
has come and gone and I didn’t get a single pair. People will insist on giving
me books.”
It was only when he was back in bed that it struck Harry that Dumbledore
might not have been quite truthful. But then, he thought, as he shoved
Scabbers off his pillow, it had been quite a personal question.D f the way.
It was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold
frame, standing on two clawed feet. There was an inscription carved around
the top: 
Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi.
His panic fading now that there was no sound of Filch and Snape, Harry
moved nearer to the mirror, wanting to look at himself but see no reflection
again. He stepped in front of it.
He had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming. He
whirled around. His heart was pounding far more furiously than when the
book had screamed — for he had seen not only himself in the mirror, but a
whole crowd of people standing right behind him.
But the room was empty. Breathing very fast, he turned slowly back to the
mirror.
There he was, reflected in it, white and scared-looking, and there, reflected
behind him, were at least ten others. Harry looked over his shoulder — but
still, no one was there. Or were they all invisible, too? Was he in fact in a
room full of invisible people and this mirror’s , pulled it out from underneath his trainers, and examined it.
He realized what it was within seconds. Sirius had given it to him just
inside the front door of twelve Grimmauld Place. 
Use it if you need me, all
right?
Harry sank down onto his bed and unwrapped the package. Out fell a small,square mirror. It looked old; it was certainly dirty. Harry held it up to his face
and saw his own reflection looking back at him.
He turned the mirror over. There on the reverse side was a scribbled note
from Sirius.
This is a two-way mirror. I’ve got the other. If you need to speak to me,
just say my name into it; you’ll appear in my mirror and I’ll be able to
talk in yours. James and I used to use them when we were in separate
detentions.
And Harry’s heart began to race. He remembered seeing his dead parents in
the Mirror of Erised four years ago. He was going to be able to talk to Sirius
again, right now, he knew it —
He looked around to make sure there was nobody else there; the dormitory
was quite empty. He looked ba"

.”
Harry snapped the earmuffs over his ears. They shut out sound completely.
Professor Sprout put the pink, fluffy pair over her own ears, rolled up thesleeves of her robes, grasped one of the tufty plants firmly, and pulled hard.
Harry let out a gasp of surprise that no one could hear.
Instead of roots, a small, muddy, and extremely ugly baby popped out of
the earth. The leaves were growing right out of his head. He had pale green,
mottled skin, and was clearly bawling at the top of his lungs.
Professor Sprout took a large plant pot from under the table and plunged
the Mandrake into it, burying him in dark, damp compost until only the tufted
leaves were visible. Professor Sprout dusted off her hands, gave them all the
thumbs-up, and removed her own earmuffs.
“As our Mandrakes are only seedlings, their cries won’t kill yet,” she said
calmly as though she’d just done nothing more exciting than water a begonia.
“However, they

 knock you out for several hours, and as I’m sure n muffled sort of thump he landed on something soft.
He sat up and felt around, his eyes not used to the gloom. It felt as though he
was sitting on some sort of plant.
“It’s okay!” he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp, which was
the open trapdoor, “it’s a soft landing, you can jump!”
Ron followed right away. He landed, sprawled next to Harry.
“What’s this stuff?” were his first words.“Dunno, some sort of plant thing. I suppose it’s here to break the fall. Come
on, Hermione!”
The distant music stopped. There was a loud bark from the dog, but
Hermione had already jumped. She landed on Harry’s other side.
“We must be miles under the school,” she said.
“Lucky this plant thing’s here, really,” said Ron.
“Lucky!”
 shrieked Hermione. “Look at you both!”
She leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. She had to struggle
because the moment she had landed, the plant had started to twist snakelike
tendrils around her ankles. As for Harry and Ron, their legs had already been
bound tightly in long creepers  ustling noise
behind Harry made him turn: Petunia, hiding behind a tree, had lost her
footing.
“Tuney!” said Lily, surprise and welcome in her voice, but Snape had
jumped to his feet.
“Who’s spying now?” he shouted. “What d’you want?”
Petunia was breathless, alarmed at being caught. Harry could see her
struggling for something hurtful to say.“What is that you’re wearing, anyway?” she said, pointing at Snape’s chest.
“Your mum’s blouse?”
There was a 
crack
: A branch over Petunia’s head had fallen. Lily screamed:
The branch caught Petunia on the shoulder, and she staggered backward and
burst into tears.
“Tuney!”
But Petunia was running away. Lily rounded on Snape.
“Did you make that happen?”
“No.” He looked both defiant and scared.
“You did!” She was backing away from him. “You 
did
! You hurt her!”
“No — no I didn’t!”
But the lie did not convince Lily: After one last burning look, she ran from
the little thicket, off after her sister, and Snape looked miserable and
confused. . . .
And the scene re-formed. Har  stopped. There was a loud bark from the dog, but
Hermione had already jumped. She landed on Harry’s other side.
“We must be miles under the school,” she said.
“Lucky this plant thing’s here, really,” said Ron.
“Lucky!”
 shrieked Hermione. “Look at you both!”
She leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. She had to struggle
because the moment she had landed, the plant had started to twist snakelike
tendrils around her ankles. As for Harry and Ron, their legs had already been
bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing.
Hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on
her. Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off
them, but the more they strained against it, the tighter and faster the plant
wound around them.
“Stop moving!” Hermione ordered them. “I know what this is — it’s
Devil’s Snare!”
“Oh, I’m so glad we know what it’s called, that’s a great help,” snarled
Ron, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck.
“Shut up, I’m oking around into the pitch-dark, and gripping
Harry’s elbow very hard.
“There’s something moving over there,” Harry breathed. “Listen . . .
sounds like something big. . . .”
They listened. Some distance to their right, the something big was snapping
branches as it carved a path through the trees.
“Oh, no,” said Ron. “Oh, no, oh, no, oh —”
“Shut up,” said Harry frantically. “It’ll hear you.”
“Hear 
me
?” said Ron in an unnaturally high voice. “It’s already heard
Fang!”
The darkness seemed to be pressing on their eyeballs as they stood,
terrified, waiting. There was a strange rumbling noise and then silence.
“What d’you think it’s doing?” said Harry.
“Probably getting ready to pounce,” said Ron.
They waited, shivering, hardly daring to move.
“D’you think it’s gone?” Harry whispered.
“Dunno —”
Then, to their right, came a sudden blaze of light, so bright in the darkness
that both of them flung up their hands to shield their eyes. Fang yelped and
tried to run, but got lodged in a tangle of thorns and yelped even n’t tell which. . . . It was making a horrible noise,
a yowling, screeching scream. . . .“Keep back there, Hagrid!” yelled a wizard near the fence, straining on the
chain he was holding. “They can shoot fire at a range of twenty feet, you
know! I’ve seen this Horntail do forty!”
“Is’n’ it beautiful?” said Hagrid softly.
“It’s no good!” yelled another wizard. “Stunning Spells, on the count of
three!”
Harry saw each of the dragon keepers pull out his wand.
“Stupefy!”
 they shouted in unison, and the Stunning Spells shot into the
darkness like fiery rockets, bursting in showers of stars on the dragons’ scaly
hides —
Harry watched the dragon nearest to them teeter dangerously on its back
legs; its jaws stretched wide in a silent howl; its nostrils were suddenly devoid
of flame, though still smoking — then, very slowly, it fell. Several tons of
sinewy, scaly-black dragon hit the ground with a thud that Harry could have
sworn made the trees behind him quake.
The dragon keepers lowered their wands and walked forward  from the upper branches of a towering
pine and turned it upside down with a roar of apparent displeasure that there
was no bird in it — eggs fell like grenades toward the ground and Hagrid
threw his arms over his head to protect himself.
“Anyway, Grawpy,” shouted Hagrid, looking up apprehensively in case of
further falling eggs, “I’ve brought some friends ter meet yeh. Remember, I
told yeh I might? Remember, when I said I might have ter go on a little trip
an’ leave them ter look after yeh fer a bit? Remember that, Grawpy?”
But Grawp merely gave another low roar; it was hard to say whether he
was listening to Hagrid or whether he even recognized the sounds Hagrid was
making as speech. He had now seized the top of the pine tree and was pulling
it toward him, evidently for the simple pleasure of seeing how far it would
spring back when he let go.
“Now, Grawpy, don’ do that!” shouted Hagrid. “Tha’s how you ended uppullin’ up the others —”
And sure enough, Harry could see the earth around the tree’s roots
beginn and lift him off the ground, so that he was hanging facedown.
Struggling, terrified, he heard more clicking, and saw Ron’s legs leave the
ground, too, heard Fang whimpering and howling — next moment, he was
being swept away into the dark trees.
Head hanging, Harry saw that what had hold of him was marching on six
immensely long, hairy legs, the front two clutching him tightly below a pair
of shining black pincers. Behind him, he could hear another of the creatures,
no doubt carrying Ron. They were moving into the very heart of the forest.
Harry could hear Fang fighting to free himself from a third monster, whining
loudly, but Harry couldn’t have yelled even if he had wanted to; he seemed to
have left his voice back with the car in the clearing.He never knew how long he was in the creature’s clutches; he only knew
that the darkness suddenly lifted enough for him to see that the leaf-strewn
ground was now swarming with spiders. Craning his neck sideways, he
realized that they had reached the ridge of a vast hol"

Harry finished reading and looked up at Ron, whose mouth was hanging
open.
“How did she find out?” he whispered.
But that wasn’t what was bothering Harry.
“What d’you mean, ‘we all hate Hagrid’?” Harry spat at Malfoy. “What’s
this rubbish about 
him
”
 — 
he pointed at Crabbe — “getting a bad bite off a
flobberworm? They haven’t even got teeth!”
Crabbe was sniggering, apparently very pleased with himself.
“Well, I think this should put an end to the oaf’s teaching career,” said
Malfoy, his eyes glinting. “Half-giant . . . and there was me thinking he’d just
swallowed a bottle of Skele-Gro when he was young. . . . None of the
mummies and daddies are going to like this at all. . . . They’ll be worried he’lleat their kids, ha, ha. . . .”
“You —”
“Are you paying attention over there?”
Professor Grubbly-Plank’s voice carried over to caped to one of
the giant communities still existing in foreign mountain ranges. If
his antics during Care of Magical Creatures lessons are any guide,
however, Fridwulfa’s son appears to have inherited her brutal
nature.
In a bizarre twist, Hagrid is reputed to have developed a close
friendship with the boy who brought around You-Know-Who’s fall
from power — thereby driving Hagrid’s own mother, like the rest of
You-Know-Who’s supporters, into hiding. Perhaps Harry Potter is
unaware of the unpleasant truth about his large friend — but Albus
Dumbledore surely has a duty to ensure that Harry Potter, along
with his fellow students, is warned about the dangers of associating
with part-giants.
Harry finished reading and looked up at Ron, whose mouth was hanging
open.
“How did she find out?” he whispered.
But that wasn’t what was bothering Harry.

he pointed at Crabbe — “getting a bad bite off a

starting to think this Prince character was a bit dodgy.”
Both Harry and Ron shouted her down at once.
“It was a laugh!” said Ron, upending a ketchup bottle over his sausages.
“Just a laugh, Hermione, that’s all!”
“Dangling people upside down by the ankle?” said Hermione. “Who puts
their time and energy into making up spells like that?”
“Fred and George,” said Ron, shrugging, “it’s their kind of thing. And, er
—”
“My dad,” said Harry. He had only just remembered.
“What?” said Ron and Hermione together.
“My dad used this spell,” said Harry. “I — Lupin told me.”
This last part was not true; in fact, Harry had seen his father use the spell
on Snape, but he had never told Ron and Hermione about that particular
excursion into the Pensieve. Now, however, a wonderful possibility occurred
to him. Could the Half-Blood Prince possibly be — ?
“Maybe your dad did use it, Harry,” said Hermione, “but he’s not the only
one. We’ve seen a whole bunch of people use say you remember him at Hogwarts, Rosmerta,” murmured Professor
McGonagall. “Do you remember who his best friend was?”
“Naturally,” said Madam Rosmerta, with a small laugh. “Never saw one
without the other, did you? The number of times I had them in here — ooh,
they used to make me laugh. Quite the double act, Sirius Black and James
Potter!”
Harry dropped his tankard with a loud clunk. Ron kicked him.
“Precisely,” said Professor McGonagall. “Black and Potter. Ringleaders of
their little gang. Both very bright, of course — exceptionally bright, in fact —
but I don’t think we’ve ever had such a pair of troublemakers —”
“I dunno,” chuckled Hagrid. “Fred and George Weasley could give ’em a
run fer their money.”
“You’d have thought Black and Potter were brothers!” chimed in Professor
Flitwick. “Inseparable!”
“Of course they were,” said Fudge. “Potter trusted Black beyond all his
other friends. Nothing changed when they left school. Black was best man
when James married Lily. Then they named him godfather to Harry. ing to crack.
“I got company fer yeh!” Hagrid shouted. “Company, see! Look down, yeh
big buffoon, I brought yeh some friends!”
“Oh Hagrid, don’t,” moaned Hermione, but Hagrid had already raised the
bough again and gave Grawp’s knee a sharp poke.
The giant let go of the top of the pine tree, which swayed menacingly and
deluged Hagrid with a rain of needles, and looked down.
“This,” 
said Hagrid, hastening over to where Harry and Hermione stood,
“is Harry, Grawp! Harry Potter! He migh’ be comin’ ter visit yeh if I have ter
go away, understand?”
The giant had only just realized that Harry and Hermione were there. They
watched, in great trepidation, as he lowered his huge boulder of a head so that
he could peer blearily at them.
“An’ this is Hermione, see? Her —” Hagrid hesitated. Turning to Hermione
he said, “Would yeh mind if he called yeh Hermy, Hermione? On’y it’s a
difficult name fer him ter remember . . .”
“No, not at all,” squeaked Hermione.
“This is Hermy, Grawp! An’ she’s gonna be comin’ an’ all! Is’n th or

adult Voldemort is the same. You will hear many of his Death Eaters claiming
that they are in his confidence, that they alone are close to him, even
understand him. They are deluded. Lord Voldemort has never had a friend,
nor do I believe that he has ever wanted one.
“And lastly — I hope you are not too sleepy to pay attention to this, Harry
— the young Tom Riddle liked to collect trophies. You saw the box of stolen
articles he had hidden in his room. These were taken from victims of his
bullying behavior, souvenirs, if you will, of particularly unpleasant bits of
magic. Bear in mind this magpie-like tendency, for this, particularly, will be
important later.“And now, it really is time for bed.”
Harry got to his feet. As he walked across the room, his eyes fell upon the
little table on which Marvolo Gaunt’s ring had rested last time, but the ring
was no longer there.
“Yes, Harry?” said Dumbledore, for Harry had come to a halt.
“Th e roll call continued. Harry watched Lupin, Pettigrew, and his father join
Lily and Sirius at the Gryffindor table. At last, when only a dozen students
remained to be sorted, Professor McGonagall called Snape.
Harry walked with him to the stool, watched him place the hat upon his
head. 
“Slytherin!” 
cried the Sorting Hat.
And Severus Snape moved off to the other side of the Hall, away from Lily,
to where the Slytherins were cheering him, to where Lucius Malfoy, a prefect
badge gleaming upon his chest, patted Snape on the back as he sat down
beside him. . . .
And the scene changed. . . .
Lily and Snape were walking across the castle courtyard, evidently arguing.
Harry hurried to catch up with them, to listen in. As he reached them, he
realized how much taller they both were: A few years seemed to have passed
since their Sorting.
“. . . thought we were supposed to be friends?” Snape was saying. “Best
friends?”
“We 
are,
 Sev, but I don’t like some of the people you’re hanging round
with! I’m sorry, but I detes ave half a mind to leave now!”
“Empty threat, Karkaroff,” growled a voice from near the door. “You can’t
leave your champion now. He’s got to compete. They’ve all got to compete.
Binding magical contract, like Dumbledore said. Convenient, eh?”
Moody had just entered the room. He limped toward the fire, and with
every right step he took, there was a loud 
clunk.
“Convenient?” said Karkaroff. “I’m afraid I don’t understand you, Moody.”
Harry could tell he was trying to sound disdainful, as though what Moody
was saying was barely worth his notice, but his hands gave him away; they
had balled themselves into fists.
“Don’t you?” said Moody quietly. “It’s very simple, Karkaroff. Someone
put Potter’s name in that goblet knowing he’d have to compete if it came
out.”
“Evidently, someone ’oo wished to give ’Ogwarts two bites at ze apple!”
said Madame Maxime.
“I quite agree, Madame Maxime,” said Karkaroff, bowing to her. “I shall be

What does a Patronus do?,Repels Dementors,"According to the text, a Patronus is a kind of anti-dementor that acts as a shield between the wizard and the dementor, a positive force that is a projection of the things that the dementor feeds upon, such as hope, happiness, and the desire to survive.","n you, Harry,
that the charm might be too advanced for you. Many qualified wizards have
difficulty with it.”
“What does a Patronus look like?” said Harry curiously.
“Each one is unique to the wizard who conjures it.”
“And how do you conjure it?”“With an incantation, which will work only if you are concentrating, with
all your might, on a single, very happy memory.”
Harry cast his mind about for a happy memory. Certainly, nothing that had
happened to him at the Dursleys’ was going to do. Finally, he settled on the
moment when he had first ridden a broomstick.
“Right,” he said, trying to recall as exactly as possible the wonderful,
soaring sensation of his stomach.
“The incantation is this —” Lupin cleared his throat. 
“Expecto Patronum!”
“Expecto Patronum,” 
Harry repeated under his breath, 
“Expecto
Patronum.”
“Concentrating hard on your happy memory?”
“Oh — yeah —” said Harry, quickly forcing his thoughts back to that first
broom ride. 
“Expecto Patrono
 — no, 
Patronum
 — sorry — 
Expecto
Patronum, Expecto  ctly, it conjures up a Patronus,” said Lupin,
“which is a kind of anti-dementor — a guardian that acts as a shield between
you and the dementor.”
Harry had a sudden vision of himself crouching behind a Hagrid-sized
figure holding a large club. Professor Lupin continued, “The Patronus is a
kind of positive force, a projection of the very things that the dementor feeds
upon — hope, happiness, the desire to survive — but it cannot feel despair, as
real humans can, so the dementors can’t hurt it. But I must warn you, Harry,
that the charm might be too advanced for you. Many qualified wizards have
difficulty with it.”
“What does a Patronus look like?” said Harry curiously.
“Each one is unique to the wizard who conjures it.”
“And how do you conjure it?”“With an incantation, which will work only if you are concentrating, with
all your might, on a single, very happy memory.”
Harry cast his mind about for a happy memory. Certainly, nothing that had
happened to him at the Dursleys’ was going to do. Finally, he settled  a cupboard under my desk he’ll like.”
“Okay,” said Harry, trying to sound as though he wasn’t apprehensive at all
and merely glad that Lupin had found such a good substitute for a real
dementor.
“So . . .” Professor Lupin had taken out his own wand, and indicated that
Harry should do the same. “The spell I am going to try and teach you is
highly advanced magic, Harry — well beyond Ordinary Wizarding Level. It
is called the Patronus Charm.”
“How does it work?” said Harry nervously.
“Well, when it works correctly, it conjures up a Patronus,” said Lupin,
“which is a kind of anti-dementor — a guardian that acts as a shield between
you and the dementor.”
Harry had a sudden vision of himself crouching behind a Hagrid-sized
figure holding a large club. Professor Lupin continued, “The Patronus is a
kind of positive force, a projection of the very things that the dementor feeds
upon — hope, happiness, the desire to survive — but it cannot feel despair, as
real humans can, so the dementors can’t hurt it. But I must war er animal. He screwed up his eyes, trying to see what it
was. It looked like a horse. It was galloping silently away from him, across
the black surface of the lake. He saw it lower its head and charge at the
swarming dementors. . . . Now it was galloping around and around the black
shapes on the ground, and the dementors were falling back, scattering,
retreating into the darkness. . . . They were gone.
The Patronus turned. It was cantering back toward Harry across the still
surface of the water. It wasn’t a horse. It wasn’t a unicorn, either. It was a
stag. It was shining brightly as the moon above . . . it was coming back to
him. . . .
It stopped on the bank. Its hooves made no mark on the soft ground as it
stared at Harry with its large, silver eyes. Slowly, it bowed its antlered head.
And Harry realized . . .
“Prongs,”
 he whispered.
But as his trembling fingertips stretched toward the creature, it vanished.
Harry stood there, hand still outstretched. Then, with a great leap of hisheart, he heard hooves be lf, guilty about his secret desire to
hear his parents’ voices again.
“You’re expecting too much of yourself,” said Professor Lupin sternly in
their fourth week of practice. “For a thirteen-year-old wizard, even an
indistinct Patronus is a huge achievement. You aren’t passing out anymore,
are you?”
“I thought a Patronus would — charge the dementors down or something,”
said Harry dispiritedly. “Make them disappear —”“The true Patronus does do that,” said Lupin. “But you’ve achieved a great
deal in a very short space of time. If the dementors put in an appearance at
your next Quidditch match, you will be able to keep them at bay long enough
to get back to the ground.”
“You said it’s harder if there are loads of them,” said Harry.
“I have complete confidence in you,” said Lupin, smiling. “Here — you’ve
earned a drink — something from the Three Broomsticks. You won’t have
tried it before —”
He pulled two bottles out of his briefcase.
“Butterbeer!” said Harry, without thinking. “Yeah, I like that stuff!”
Lupin rai ad, come on —”
But no one came. Harry raised his head to look at the circle of dementors
across the lake. One of them was lowering its hood. It was time for the
rescuer to appear — but no one was coming to help this time —
And then it hit him — he understood. He hadn’t seen his father — he had
seen 
himself —
Harry flung himself out from behind the bush and pulled out his wand.
“EXPECTO PATRONUM!”
 he yelled.
And out of the end of his wand burst, not a shapeless cloud of mist, but a
blinding, dazzling, silver animal. He screwed up his eyes, trying to see what it
was. It looked like a horse. It was galloping silently away from him, across
the black surface of the lake. He saw it lower its head and charge at the
swarming dementors. . . . Now it was galloping around and around the black
shapes on the ground, and the dementors were falling back, scattering,
retreating into the darkness. . . . They were gone.
The Patronus turned. It was cantering back toward Harry across the still
surface of the water. It wasn’t a ake your Patronus? You managed perfectly yesterday!”
“I don’t know.”
He sat low in one of Perkins’s old armchairs, feeling more humiliated by
the moment. He was afraid that something had gone wrong inside him.
Yesterday seemed a long time ago: Today he might have been thirteen years
old again, the only one who collapsed on the Hogwarts Express.
Ron kicked a chair leg.
“What?” he snarled at Hermione. “I’m starving! All I’ve had since I bled
half to death is a couple of toadstools!”
“You go and fight your way through the dementors, then,” said Harry,
stung.
“I would, but my arm’s in a sling, in case you hadn’t noticed!”
“That’s convenient.”“And what’s that supposed to — ?”
“Of course!” cried Hermione, clapping a hand to her forehead and startling
both of them into silence. “Harry, give me the locket! Come on,” she said
impatiently, clicking her fingers at him when he did not react, “the Horcrux,
Harry, you’re still wearing it!”
She held out her hands, and Harry lifted the golden chain over his head.
The moment  rl with the long plait down her back, looking
at Harry, “that you can produce a Patronus?”
There was a murmur of interest around the group at this.
“Yeah,” said Harry slightly defensively.
“A corporeal Patronus?”
The phrase stirred something in Harry’s memory.
“Er — you don’t know Madam Bones, do you?” he asked.
The girl smiled.
“She’s my auntie,” she said. “I’m Susan Bones. She told me about your
hearing. So — is it really true? You make a stag Patronus?”
“Yes,” said Harry.
“Blimey, Harry!” said Lee, looking deeply impressed. “I never knew that!”
“Mum told Ron not to spread it around,” said Fred, grinning at Harry. “She
said you got enough attention as it was.”
“She’s not wrong,” mumbled Harry and a couple of people laughed. The
veiled witch sitting alone shifted very slightly in her seat.
“And did you kill a basilisk with that sword in Dumbledore’s office?”
demanded Terry Boot. “That’s what one of the portraits on the wall told me
when I was in there last year . . .”
“Er — yeah, I did, yeah,” said Harry.

What form does Harry's Patronus take?,A stag,"According to the passage, Harry's Patronus takes the form of a Hagrid-sized figure holding a large club.","ctly, it conjures up a Patronus,” said Lupin,
“which is a kind of anti-dementor — a guardian that acts as a shield between

Harry cast his mind about for a happy memory. Certainly, nothing that had
happened to him at the Dursleys’ was going to do. Finally, he settled on the
moment when he had first ridden a broomstick.
“Right,” he said, trying to recall as exactly as possible the wonderful,
soaring sensation of his stomach.
“The incantation is this —” Lupin cleared his throat. 
“Expecto Patronum!”
“Expecto Patronum,” 
Harry repeated under his breath, 
“Expecto
Patronum.”
“Concentrating hard on your happy memory?”
“Oh — yeah —” said Harry, quickly forcing his thoughts back to that first
broom ride. 
“Expecto Patrono
 — no,

Expecto

turn into a good, strong Patronus . . .
The moment when he’d first found out he was a wizard, and would be
leaving the Dursleys for Hogwarts! If that wasn’t a happy memory, he didn’t
know what was. . . . Concentrating very hard on how he had felt when he’d
realized he’d be leaving Privet Drive, Harry got to his feet and faced the
packing case once more.
“Ready?” said Lupin, who looked as though he were doing this against his
better judgment. “Concentrating hard? All right — go!”
He pulled off the lid of the case for the third time, and the dementor rose
out of it; the room fell cold and dark —
“EXPECTO PATRONUM!”
 Harry bellowed. 
“EXPECTO PATRONUM!
EXPECTO PATRONUM!”
The screaming inside Harry’s head had started again — except this time, it
sounded as though it were coming from a badly tuned radio — softer and
louder and softer again — and he could still see the dementor — it had halted
— and then a huge, silver shadow came bursting out of the end of Harry’s
wand, to hover between hi  . . . unless . . .”
He leaned forward a little.
“I heard, from my dear friend Tiberius Ogden, that you can produce a
Patronus? For a bonus point . . . ?”
Harry raised his wand, looked directly at Umbridge, and imagined her
being sacked.
“Expecto Patronum!”
The silver stag erupted from the end of his wand and cantered the length of
the hall. All of the examiners looked around to watch its progress and when it
dissolved into silver mist, Professor Tofty clapped his veined and knotted
hands enthusiastically.
“Excellent!” he said. “Very well, Potter, you may go!”
As Harry passed Umbridge beside the door their eyes met. There was a
nasty smile playing around her wide, slack mouth, but he did not care. Unless
he was very much mistaken (and he was not planning on saying it to anybody,
in case he was), he had just achieved an “Outstanding” O.W.L.
On Friday, Harry and Ron had a day off while Hermione sat her Ancient
Runes exam, and as they had the whole weekend in front of them, they
permitted themselves a break from d
around.
His stomach turned over.
A towering, hooded figure was gliding smoothly toward him, hovering over
the ground, no feet or face visible beneath its robes, sucking on the night as it
came.Stumbling backward, Harry raised his wand.
“Expecto Patronum!”
A silvery wisp of vapor shot from the tip of the wand and the dementor
slowed, but the spell hadn’t worked properly; tripping over his feet, Harry
retreated farther as the dementor bore down upon him, panic fogging his brain
— 
concentrate 
—
A pair of gray, slimy, scabbed hands slid from inside the dementor’s robes,
reaching for him. A rushing noise filled Harry’s ears.
“Expecto Patronum!”
His voice sounded dim and distant . . . Another wisp of silver smoke,
feebler than the last, drifted from the wand — he couldn’t do it anymore, he
couldn’t work the spell —
There was laughter inside his own head, shrill, high-pitched laughter . . .
He could smell the dementor’s putrid, death-cold breath, filling his own
lungs, drowning him — 
Think . . . something happy y something like a
dementor.
“Oh, don’t be such a killjoy,” said Cho brightly, watching her silvery swan-
shaped Patronus soar around the Room of Requirement during their last
lesson before Easter. “They’re so pretty!”
“They’re not supposed to be pretty, they’re supposed to protect you,” said
Harry patiently. “What we really need is a boggart or something; that’s how I
learned, I had to conjure a Patronus while the boggart was pretending to be a
dementor —”
“But that would be really scary!” said Lavender, who was shooting puffs of
silver vapor out of the end of her wand. “And I still — can’t — do it!” she
added angrily.
Neville was having trouble too. His face was screwed up in concentration,
but only feeble wisps of silver smoke issued from his wand-tip.
“You’ve got to think of something happy,” Harry reminded him.
“I’m trying,” said Neville miserably, who was trying so hard his round face
was actually shining with sweat.
“Harry, I think I’m doing it!” yelled Seamus, who had been brought along
to his first e re courteously. “Then we are in
agreement that Harry’s use of the Patronus Charm in these circumstances falls
precisely into the category of exceptional circumstances it describes?”“If there were dementors, which I doubt —”
“You have heard from an eyewitness,” Dumbledore interrupted. “If you
still doubt her truthfulness, call her back, question her again. I am sure she
would not object.”
“I — that — not —” blustered Fudge, fiddling with the papers before him.
“It’s — I want this over with today, Dumbledore!”
“But naturally, you would not care how many times you heard from a
witness, if the alternative was a serious miscarriage of justice,” said
Dumbledore.
“Serious miscarriage, my hat!” said Fudge at the top of his voice. “Have
you ever bothered to tot up the number of cock-and-bull stories this boy has
come out with, Dumbledore, while trying to cover up his flagrant misuse of
magic out of school? I suppose you’ve forgotten the Hover Charm he used
three years ago —”
“That wasn’t me, it was a house-elf!” said "
What spell is used to erase memories?,Obliviate,The spell used to erase memories is Impervius.,"y just remembered.
“What?” said Ron and Hermione together.
“My dad used this spell,” said Harry. “I — Lupin told me.”
This last part was not true; in fact, Harry had seen his father use the spell
on Snape, but he had never told Ron and Hermione about that particular
excursion into the Pensieve. Now, however, a wonderful possibility occurred
to him. Could the Half-Blood Prince possibly be — ?
“Maybe your dad did use it, Harry,” said Hermione, “but he’s not the only
one. We’ve seen a whole bunch of people use it, in case you’ve forgotten.
Dangling people in the air. Making them float along, asleep, helpless.”
Harry stared at her. With a sinking feeling, he too remembered the behavior
of the Death Eaters at the Quidditch World Cup. Ron came to his aid.
“That was different,” he said robustly. “They were abusing it. Harry and his
dad were just having a laugh. You don’t like the Prince, Hermione,” he added,pointing a sausage at her sternly, “because he’s better than you at Potions —”
“It’s got nothing to do with th get hold of the memory suddenly seemed embarrassingly feeble. “Well . . . the
day Ron swallowed love potion by mistake I took him to Professor Slughorn.
I thought maybe if I got Professor Slughorn in a good enough mood —”
“And did that work?” asked Dumbledore.
“Well, no, sir, because Ron got poisoned —”
“— which, naturally, made you forget all about trying to retrieve the
memory; I would have expected nothing else, while your best friend was in
danger. Once it became clear that Mr. Weasley was going to make a full
recovery, however, I would have hoped that you returned to the task I set you.
I thought I made it clear to you how very important that memory is. Indeed, I
did my best to impress upon you that it is the most crucial memory of all and
that we will be wasting our time without it.”
A hot, prickly feeling of shame spread from the top of Harry’s head all the
way down his body. Dumbledore had not raised his voice, he did not even
sound angry, but Harry would have preferred him to yell; this colddisappoin  father who
never wanted him. Then he returned to the Gaunt hovel, performed the
complex bit of magic that would implant a false memory in his uncle’s mind,
laid Morfin’s wand beside its unconscious owner, pocketed the ancient ring he
wore, and departed.”
“And Morfin never realized he hadn’t done it?”
“Never,” said Dumbledore. “He gave, as I say, a full and boastful
confession.”
“But he had this real memory in him all the time!”
“Yes, but it took a great deal of skilled Legilimency to coax it out of him,”
said Dumbledore, “and why should anybody delve further into Morfin’s mind
when he had already confessed to the crime? However, I was able to secure a
visit to Morfin in the last weeks of his life, by which time I was attempting to
discover as much as I could about Voldemort’s past. I extracted this memory
with difficulty. When I saw what it contained, I attempted to use it to secure
Morfin’s release from Azkaban. Before the Ministry reached their decision,
however, Morfin had died.”
“But how come the Ministr over again, leaving the place where it had been slightly redder than before but
quite smooth.
Harry looked around at Umbridge. She was watching him, her wide,
toadlike mouth stretched in a smile.
“Yes?”
“Nothing,” said Harry quietly.
He looked back at the parchment, placed the quill upon it once more, wrote
I must not tell lies,
 and felt the searing pain on the back of his hand for a
second time; once again the words had been cut into his skin, once again they
healed over seconds later.
And on it went. Again and again Harry wrote the words on the parchment
in what he soon came to realize was not ink, but his own blood. And again
and again the words were cut into the back of his hand, healed, and then
reappeared the next time he set quill to parchment.
Darkness fell outside Umbridge’s window. Harry did not ask when he
would be allowed to stop. He did not even check his watch. He knew she was
watching him for signs of weakness and he was not going to show any, not
even if he had to sit here all night, cutting  So Voldemort stole Morfin’s wand and used it?” said Harry, sitting up
straight.
“That’s right,” said Dumbledore. “We have no memories to show us this,but I think we can be fairly sure what happened. Voldemort Stupefied his
uncle, took his wand, and proceeded across the valley to ‘the big house over
the way.’ There he murdered the Muggle man who had abandoned his witch
mother, and, for good measure, his Muggle grandparents, thus obliterating the
last of the unworthy Riddle line and revenging himself upon the father who
never wanted him. Then he returned to the Gaunt hovel, performed the
complex bit of magic that would implant a false memory in his uncle’s mind,
laid Morfin’s wand beside its unconscious owner, pocketed the ancient ring he
wore, and departed.”
“And Morfin never realized he hadn’t done it?”
“Never,” said Dumbledore. “He gave, as I say, a full and boastful
confession.”
“But he had this real memory in him all the time!”
“Yes, but it took a great deal of skilled Legilimency to coax it out of him,”
s  upon itself. He licked his
lips and said hoarsely, “What did you say?”
“I asked whether you know anything about Horcruxes, sir. You see —”
“Dumbledore put you up to this,” whispered Slughorn. His voice had
changed completely. It was not genial anymore, but shocked, terrified. He
fumbled in his breast pocket and pulled out a handkerchief, mopping his
sweating brow. “Dumbledore’s shown you that — that memory. Well? Hasn’t
he?”
“Yes,” said Harry, deciding on the spot that it was best not to lie.
“Yes, of course,” said Slughorn quietly, still dabbing at his white face. “Of
course . . . well, if you’ve seen that memory, Harry, you’ll know that I don’t
know anything — 
anything
” — he repeated the word forcefully — “about
Horcruxes.”
He seized his dragon-skin briefcase, stuffed his handkerchief back into his
pocket, and marched to the dungeon door.“Sir,” said Harry desperately, “I just thought there might be a bit more to
the memory —”
“Did you?” said Slughorn. “Then you were wrong, weren’t you?
WRONG!”
He bellowe sked shakily.
“This? It is called a Pensieve,” said Dumbledore. “I sometimes find, and I
am sure you know the feeling, that I simply have too many thoughts and
memories crammed into my mind.”
“Er,” said Harry, who couldn’t truthfully say that he had ever felt anything
of the sort.
“At these times,” said Dumbledore, indicating the stone basin, “I use the
Pensieve. One simply siphons the excess thoughts from one’s mind, pours
them into the basin, and examines them at one’s leisure. It becomes easier to
spot patterns and links, you understand, when they are in this form.”
“You mean . . . that stuff’s your 
thoughts
?” Harry said, staring at the
swirling white substance in the basin.
“Certainly,” said Dumbledore. “Let me show you.”
Dumbledore drew his wand out of the inside of his robes and placed the tip
into his own silvery hair, near his temple. When he took the wand away, hair
seemed to be clinging to it — but then Harry saw that it was in fact a
glistening strand of the same strange silvery-white substance t  Foul.
“Here you are,” said the manager, who had climbed a set of steps to take
down a thick, black-bound book. “
Unfogging the Future.
 Very good guide to
all your basic fortune-telling methods — palmistry, crystal balls, bird entrails
—”
But Harry wasn’t listening. His eyes had fallen on another book, which was
among a display on a small table: 
Death Omens: What to Do When You Knowthe Worst Is Coming.
“Oh, I wouldn’t read that if I were you,” said the manager lightly, looking
to see what Harry was staring at. “You’ll start seeing death omens
everywhere. It’s enough to frighten anyone to death.”
But Harry continued to stare at the front cover of the book; it showed a
black dog large as a bear, with gleaming eyes. It looked oddly familiar. . . .
The manager pressed 
Unfogging the Future
 into Harry’s hands.
“Anything else?” he said.
“Yes,” said Harry, tearing his eyes away from the dog’s and dazedly
consulting his booklist. “Er — I need

At the end of the year, the House with the most points is awarded the House

of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can
while you are waiting.”
Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville’s cloak, which was fastened
under his left ear, and on Ron’s smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to
flatten his hair.
“I shall return when we are r law, the cleverest
Would always be the best;
For Hufflepuff, hard workers were

The Great Hall rang with applause as the Sorting Hat finished.“That’s not the song it sang when it Sorted us,” said Harry, clapping along
with everyone else.
“Sings a different one every year,” said Ron. “It’s got to be a pretty boring
life, hasn’t it, being a hat? I suppose it spends all year making up the next
one.”
Professor McGonagall was now unrolling a large scroll of parchment.
“When I call out your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool,”
she told the first yea  L’s.
“Oh hurry up,” Ron moaned, massaging his stomach.
“Now, Ron, the Sorting’s much more important than food,” said Nearly
Headless Nick as “Madley, Laura!” became a Hufflepuff.“’Course it is, if you’re dead,” snapped Ron.
“I do hope this year’s batch of Gryffindors are up to scratch,” said Nearly
Headless Nick, applauding as “McDonald, Natalie!” joined the Gryffindor
table. “We don’t want to break our winning streak, do we?”
Gryffindor had won the Inter-House Championship for the last three years
in a row.
“Pritchard, Graham!”
“SLYTHERIN!”
“Quirke, Orla!”
“RAVENCLAW!”
And finally, with “Whitby, Kevin!”(“HUFFLEPUFF!”), the Sorting ended.
Professor McGonagall picked up the hat and the stool and carried them away.
“About time,” said Ron, seizing his knife and fork and looking expectantly
at his golden plate.
Professor Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was smiling around at the
students, his arms opened wide in welcome.
“I have only two words to say to you,” he told them, his deep voice echoing
around the  rom a doorway to the right — the
rest of the school must already be here — but Professor McGonagall showed
the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in,
standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering
about nervously.
“Welcome to Hogwarts,” said Professor McGonagall. “The start-of-term
banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall,
you will be sorted into your Houses. The Sorting is a very importantceremony because, while you are here, your House will be something like

“Dennis! Dennis! See that boy down there? The one with the black hair and

Harry looked away, staring very hard at the Sorting Hat, now Sorting
Emma Dobbs.
The Sorting continued; boys and girls with varying degrees of fright on
their faces moving one by one to the four-legged stool, the line dwindling
slowly as Professor McGonagall passed the L’s.
“Oh hurry up,” Ron moaned, massaging his stomach.
“Now, Ron, the Sorting’s much more important than food,” said Nearly
Headless Nick as “Madley, Laura!” became a Hufflepuff.“’Course it is, if you’re dead,” snapped Ron.
“I do hope this year’s batch of Gryffindors are up to scratch,” said Nearly

Gryffindor had won the Inter-House Championship for the last three years
in a ro rs. “When the hat announces your House, you will go and
sit at the appropriate table.
“Ackerley, Stewart!”
A boy walked forward, visibly trembling from head to foot, picked up the
Sorting Hat, put it on, and sat down on the stool.
“RAVENCLAW!” shouted the hat.
Stewart Ackerley took off the hat and hurried into a seat at the Ravenclaw
table, where everyone was applauding him. Harry caught a glimpse of Cho,
the Ravenclaw Seeker, cheering Stewart Ackerley as he sat down. For a
fleeting second, Harry had a strange desire to join the Ravenclaw table too.
“Baddock, Malcolm!”
“SLYTHERIN!”
The table on the other side of the hall erupted with cheers; Harry could see
Malfoy clapping as Baddock joined the Slytherins. Harry wondered whether
Baddock knew that Slytherin House had turned out more Dark witches and
wizards than any other. Fred and George hissed Malcolm Baddock as he sat
down.
“Branstone, Eleanor!”
“HUFFLEPUFF!”
“Cauldwell, Owen!”
“HUFFLEPUFF!”
“Creevey, Dennis!”Tiny Dennis Creevey staggered forward, tripping  taff table. The Great Hall, which in any case had been less noisy than it
usually was at the Leaving Feast, became very quiet.
“The end,” said Dumbledore, looking around at them all, “of another year.”
He paused, and his eyes fell upon the Hufflepuff table. Theirs had been the
most subdued table before he had gotten to his feet, and theirs were still the
saddest and palest faces in the Hall.
“There is much that I would like to say to you all tonight,” said
Dumbledore, “but I must first acknowledge the loss of a very fine person,
who should be sitting here,” he gestured toward the Hufflepuffs, “enjoying
our feast with us. I would like you all, please, to stand, and raise your glasses,
to Cedric Diggory.”
They did it, all of them; the benches scraped as everyone in the Hall stood,
and raised their goblets, and echoed, in one loud, low, rumbling voice,
“Cedric Diggory.”
Harry caught a glimpse of Cho through the crowd. There were tears
pouring silently down her face. He looked down at the table as they all sat
do . .
“You all know, of course, that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years
ago — the precise date is uncertain — by the four greatest witches and
wizards of the age. The four school Houses are named after them: Godric
Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin.
They built this castle together, far from prying Muggle eyes, for it was an age
when magic was feared by common people, and witches and wizards suffered
much persecution.”
He paused, gazed blearily around the room, and continued.
“For a few years, the founders worked in harmony together, seeking out
youngsters who showed signs of magic and bringing them to the castle to be
educated. But then disagreements sprang up between them. A rift began to
grow between Slytherin and the others. Slytherin wished to be more 
selective
about the students admitted to Hogwarts. He believed that magical learning
should be kept within all-magic families. He disliked taking students ofMuggle parentage, believing them to be untrustworthy. Afte"
What creature is Buckbeak?,Hippogriff,Buckbeak is a hippogriff.,"y, Ron, and
Hermione whip around. Buckbeak the hippogriff was lying in the corner,
chomping on something that was oozing blood all over the floor.
“I couldn’ leave him tied up out there in the snow!” choked Hagrid. “All on
his own! At Christmas.”
Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another. They had never seen eye
to eye with Hagrid about what he called “interesting creatures” and other
people called “terrifying monsters.” On the other hand, there didn’t seem to
be any particular harm in Buckbeak. In fact, by Hagrid’s usual standards, he
was positively cute.
“You’ll have to put up a good strong defense, Hagrid,” said Hermione,
sitting down and laying a hand on Hagrid’s massive forearm. “I’m sure you
can prove Buckbeak is safe.”
“Won’t make no diff’rence!” sobbed Hagrid. “Them Disposal devils,
they’re all in Lucius Malfoy’s pocket! Scared o’ him! An’ if I lose the case,
Buckbeak —”
Hagrid drew his finger swiftly across his throat, then gave a great wail and
lurched forward, his face in his arms.
“What about ’s offices in London on that date. In the meantime, the
hippogriff should be kept tethered and isolated.
Yours in fellowship . . .
There followed a list of the school governors.
“Oh,” said Ron. “But you said Buckbeak isn’t a bad hippogriff, Hagrid. I
bet he’ll get off —”
“Yeh don’ know them gargoyles at the Committee fer the Disposal o’
Dangerous Creatures!” choked Hagrid, wiping his eyes on his sleeve.
“They’ve got it in fer interestin’ creatures!”
A sudden sound from the corner of Hagrid’s cabin made Harry, Ron, and
Hermione whip around. Buckbeak the hippogriff was lying in the corner,
chomping on something that was oozing blood all over the floor.
“I couldn’ leave him tied up out there in the snow!” choked Hagrid. “All on
his own! At Christmas.”
Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another. They had never seen eye
to eye with Hagrid about what he called “interesting creatures” and other
people called “terrifying monsters.” On the other hand, there didn’t seem to
be any particular harm in Buckbeak. In fac h. Buckbeak broke into a grudging trot. They
had reached the trees. . . .
“Quick! Quick!” Hermione moaned, darting out from behind her tree,
seizing the rope too and adding her weight to make Buckbeak move faster.
Harry looked over his shoulder; they were now blocked from sight; they
couldn’t see Hagrid’s garden at all.
“Stop!” he whispered to Hermione. “They might hear us —”
Hagrid’s back door had opened with a bang. Harry, Hermione, and
Buckbeak stood quite still; even the hippogriff seemed to be listening intently.
Silence . . . then —
“Where is it?” said the reedy voice of the Committee member. “Where is
the beast?”
“It was tied here!” said the executioner furiously. “I saw it! Just here!”
“How extraordinary,” said Dumbledore. There was a note of amusement in
his voice.
“Beaky!” said Hagrid huskily.
There was a swishing noise, and the thud of an axe. The executioner
seemed to have swung it into the fence in anger. And then came the howling,
and this time they could hear Hagrid’s words through his sobs.“Go the top of Buckbeak’s wing and hoisted himself onto
its back. Buckbeak stood up. Harry wasn’t sure where to hold on; everything
in front of him was covered with feathers.
“Go on, then!” roared Hagrid, slapping the hippogriff’s hindquarters.
Without warning, twelve-foot wings flapped open on either side of Harry;
he just had time to seize the hippogriff around the neck before he was soaring
upward. It was nothing like a broomstick, and Harry knew which one he
preferred; the hippogriff’s wings beat uncomfortably on either side of him,
catching him under his legs and making him feel he was about to be thrown
off; the glossy feathers slipped under his fingers and he didn’t dare get a
stronger grip; instead of the smooth action of his Nimbus Two Thousand, he
now felt himself rocking backward and forward as the hindquarters of the
hippogriff rose and fell with its wings.
Buckbeak flew him once around the paddock and then headed back to the
ground; this was the bit Harry had been dreading; he leaned back as the
smoo ou see him lumbering off in the wrong direction on his fifth?
Looked like he’d been Confunded. . . .”
To Harry’s surprise, Hermione turned a very deep shade of pink at these
words. Ron noticed nothing; he was too busy describing each of his other
penalties in loving detail.
The great gray hippogriff, Buckbeak, was tethered in front of Hagrid’s
cabin. He clicked his razor-sharp beak at their approach and turned his huge
head toward them.
“Oh dear,” said Hermione nervously. “He’s still a bit scary, isn’t he?”
“Come off it, you’ve ridden him, haven’t you?” said Ron.
Harry stepped forward and bowed low to the hippogriff without breaking
eye contact or blinking. After a few seconds, Buckbeak sank into a bow too.
“How are you?” Harry asked him in a low voice, moving forward to stroke
the feathery head. “Missing him? But you’re okay here with Hagrid, aren’t
you?”
“Oi!” said a loud voice.Hagrid had come striding around the corner of his cabin wearing a large
flowery apron and carrying a sack of potatoes. His enormous was thrilled to
see Buckbeak again. Incidentally, we have decided, in the interests of
Buckbeak’s safety, to rechristen him ‘Witherwings’ for the time being, though
I doubt that the Ministry would ever guess he is the hippogriff they once
sentenced to death. Now, Harry, is your trunk packed?”
“Erm . . .”
“Doubtful that I would turn up?” Dumbledore suggested shrewdly.
“I’ll just go and — er — finish off,” said Harry hastily, hurrying to pick up
his fallen telescope and trainers.
It took him a little over ten minutes to track down everything he needed; at
last he had managed to extract his Invisibility Cloak from under the bed,
screwed the top back on his jar of color-change ink, and forced the lid of his
trunk shut on his cauldron. Then, heaving his trunk in one hand and holding
Hedwig’s cage in the other, he made his way back downstairs.
He was disappointed to discover that Dumbledore was not waiting in the
hall, which meant that he had to return to the living room.
Nobody was talking. Dumbledore was humming  ith Buckbeak . . . but Harry, be
careful — there’s a werewolf out there — and the dementors —”
Harry stepped outside again and edged around the cabin. He could hear
yelping in the distance. That meant the dementors were closing in on
Sirius. . . . He and Hermione would be running to him any moment. . . .
Harry stared out toward the lake, his heart doing a kind of drumroll in his
chest. . . . Whoever had sent that Patronus would be appearing at any
moment. . . .
For a fraction of a second he stood, irresolute, in front of Hagrid’s door.
You must not be seen.
 But he didn’t want to be seen. He wanted to do the
seeing. . . . He had to know. . . .
And there were the dementors. They were emerging out of the darkness
from every direction, gliding around the edges of the lake. . . . They were
moving away from where Harry stood, to the opposite bank. . . . He wouldn’t
have to get near them. . . .
Harry began to run. He had no thought in his head except his father. . . . If it
was him . . . if it really was him . . .  patches all around the cabin and heard
three pairs of feet retreating. He, Ron, and Hermione had gone . . . but the
Harry and Hermione hidden in the trees could now hear what was happening
inside the cabin through the back door.
“Where is the beast?” came the cold voice of Macnair.“Out — outside,” Hagrid croaked.
Harry pulled his head out of sight as Macnair’s face appeared at Hagrid’s
window, staring out at Buckbeak. Then they heard Fudge.
“We — er — have to read you the official notice of execution, Hagrid. I’ll
make it quick. And then you and Macnair need to sign it. Macnair, you’re
supposed to listen too, that’s procedure —”
Macnair’s face vanished from the window. It was now or never.
“Wait here,” Harry whispered to Hermione. “I’ll do it.”
As Fudge’s voice started again, Harry darted out from behind his tree,
vaulted the fence into the pumpkin patch, and approached Buckbeak.
“It is the decision of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous
Creatures that the hippogriff Buckbeak, hereafter called the con"

There lived four wizards of renown,
Whose names are still well known:
Bold Gryffindor, from wild moor,

Shrewd Slytherin, from fen.
They shared a wish, a hope, a dream,
They hatched a daring plan
To educate young sorcerers

Formed their own House, for each
Did value different virtues
In the ones they had to teach.
By Gryffindor, the bravest were
Prized far beyond the rest;
For Ravenclaw, the cleverest
Would always be the best;
For Hufflepuff, hard workers were
Most worthy of admission;
And power-hungry Slytherin
Loved those of great ambition.

Their favorites from the throng,

I fell in the lake!
 He looked positively delighted about it.
Professor McGonagall now placed a four-legged stool on the ground before
the first years and, on top of it, an extremely old, dirty, patched wizard’s hat.
The first years stared at it. So did everyone else. For a moment, there was
silence. Then a long tear near the brim opened wide like a mouth, and the hat
broke into song:
A thousand years or more ago,
When I was newly sewn,

The Great Hall rang with applause as the Sorting Hat finished.“That’s not the song it sang when it Sorted us,” said Harry, clapping along
with everyone else.
“Sings a different one every year,” said Ron. “It’s got to be a pretty boring
life, hasn’t it, being a hat? I suppose it spends all year making up the next
one.”
Professor McGonagall was now unrolling a large scroll of parchment.
“When I call out your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool,”
she told the first yea ofessor Binns slowly, “yes, one could argue that, I suppose.”
He peered at Hermione as though he had never seen a student properly before.
“However, the legend of which you speak is such a very 
sensational,
 even
ludicrous
 tale —”
But the whole class was now hanging on Professor Binns’s every word. He
looked dimly at them all, every face turned to his. Harry could tell he was
completely thrown by such an unusual show of interest.
“Oh, very well,” he said slowly. “Let me see . . . the Chamber of
Secrets . . .
“You all know, of course, that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years

He paused, gazed blearily around the room, and c rom a doorway to the right — the
rest of the school must already be here — but Professor McGonagall showed
the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in,
standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering
about nervously.
“Welcome to Hogwarts,” said Professor McGonagall. “The start-of-term
banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall,
you will be sorted into your Houses. The Sorting is a very importantceremony because, while you are here, your House will be something like
your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your
House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free time in your House
common room.
“The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and
Slytherin. Each House has its own noble history and each has produced
outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs
will earn your House points, while any rule-breaking will lose House points.
At the end of the rotection. The villages of Tinworth in Cornwall, Upper Flagley
in Yorkshire, and Ottery St. Catchpole on the south coast of England were
notable homes to knots of Wizarding families who lived alongside tolerant
and sometimes Confunded Muggles. Most celebrated of these half-magical
dwelling places is, perhaps, Godric’s Hollow, the West Country village where
the great wizard Godric Gryffindor was born, and where Bowman Wright,
Wizarding smith, forged the first Golden Snitch. The graveyard is full of the
names of ancient magical families, and this accounts, no doubt, for the stories
of hauntings that have dogged the little church beside it for many centuries.’
“You and your parents aren’t mentioned,” Hermione said, closing the book,
“because Professor Bagshot doesn’t cover anything later than the end of the
nineteenth century. But you see? Godric’s Hollow, Godric Gryffindor,Gryffindor’s sword; don’t you think Dumbledore would have expected you to
make the connection?”
“Oh yeah . . .”

At the end of the year, the House with the most points is awarded the House
Cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever House
becomes yours.

of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can

under his left ear, and on Ron’s smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to

toward the concealed entrance to the Room of Requirement. As they ran, they
met crowds of students, most wearing traveling cloaks over their pajamas,
being shepherded down to the Great Hall by teachers and prefects.
“That was Potter!”
“Harry Potter!”
“It was him, I swear, I just saw him!”
But Harry did not look back, and at last they reached the entrance to the
Room of Requirement. Harry leaned against the enchanted wall, which
opened to admit them, and he and Luna sped back down the steep staircase.
“Wh — ?”
As the room came into view, Harry slipped down a few stairs in shock. It
was packed, far more crowded than when he had last been in there. Kingsley
and Lupin were looking up at him, as were Oliver Wood, Katie Bell, Angelina
Johnson and Alicia Spinnet, Bill and Fleur, and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley.
“Harry, what’s happening?” said Lupin, meeting him at the foot of the
stairs.
“Voldemort’s on his way, they’re barricading the school — Snape’s run for
it — What are you doing here? How did you know?”
“We s rom a doorway to the right — the

At the end of the “Man the
boundaries, protect us, do your duty to our school!”
Clattering and yelling, the horde of moving statues stampeded past Harry:some of them smaller, others larger, than life. There were animals too, and the
clanking suits of armor brandished swords and spiked balls on chains.
“Now, Potter,” said McGonagall, “you and Miss Lovegood had better
return to your friends and bring them to the Great Hall — I shall rouse the
other Gryffindors.”
They parted at the top of the next staircase, Harry and Luna running back
toward the concealed entrance to the Room of Requirement. As they ran, they
met crowds of students, most wearing traveling cloaks over their pajamas,
being shepherded down to the Great Hall by teachers and prefects.
“That was Potter!”

opened to admit them, and he and Luna sped back down the steep staircas n’t go to Hogwarts, do
they?”
“’Spect they go to some foreign school,” said Ron. “I know there are
others. Never met anyone who went to one, though. Bill had a penfriend at a
school in Brazil . . . this was years and years ago . . . and he wanted to go on
an exchange trip but Mum and Dad couldn’t afford it. His penfriend got all
offended when he said he wasn’t going and sent him a cursed hat. It made his
ears shrivel up.”
Harry laughed but didn’t voice the amazement he felt at hearing about other
Wizarding schools. He supposed, now that he saw representatives of so many
nationalities in the campsite, that he had been stupid never to realize that
Hogwarts couldn’t be the only one. He glanced at Hermione, who looked
utterly unsurprised by the information. No doubt she had run across the news
about other Wizarding schools in some book or other.
“You’ve been ages,” said George when they finally got back to the
Weasleys’ tents.
“Met a few people,” said Ron, setting the water down. “You not got that

“Dad’s having fun with the matches,” said Fred.Mr. Weasley was having no success at all in lighting the fire, but it wasn’t
for lack of trying. Splintered matches littered the ground around him, but he
looked as though he was having the time of his life.
“Oops!” he said as he managed to light a match and promptly dropped it in
surprise.
“Come here, Mr. Weasley,” said Hermione kindly, taking the box from him,
and showing him how to do it properly.
At last they got the fire lit, though it was at least ano 
“Watch it!” Hagrid roared, pulling Ron away from his precious pumpkins.
It was nearly lunchtime and as Harry had only had one bit of treacle toffeesince dawn, he was keen to go back to school to eat. They said good-bye to
Hagrid and walked back up to the castle, Ron hiccoughing occasionally, but
only bringing up two very small slugs.
They had barely set foot in the cool entrance hall when a voice rang out,
“There you are, Potter — Weasley.” Professor McGonagall was walking
toward them, looking stern. “You will both do your detentions this evening.”
“What’re we doing, Professor?” said Ron, nervously suppressing a burp.
“
You
 will be polishing the silver in the trophy room with Mr. Filch,” said
Professor McGonagall. “And no magic, Weasley — elbow grease.”
Ron gulped. Argus Filch, the caretaker, was loathed by every student in the
school.
“And you, Potter, will be helping Professor Lockhart answer his fan mail,”
said Professor McGonagall.
“Oh n — Professor, can’t I go and do the trophy room, too?” said Harry
d  remain at Hogwarts as a teacher.”
“He wanted to stay here? Why?” asked Harry, more amazed still.
“I believe he had several reasons, though he confided none of them to
Professor Dippet,” said Dumbledore. “Firstly, and very importantly,
Voldemort was, I believe, more attached to this school than he has ever been
to a person. Hogwarts was where he had been happiest; the first and only
place he had felt at home.”
Harry felt slightly uncomfortable at these words, for this was exactly how
he felt about Hogwarts too.
“Secondly, the castle is a stronghold of ancient magic. Undoubtedly
Voldemort had penetrated many more of its secrets than most of the students
who pass through the place, but he may have felt that there were still
mysteries to unravel, stores of magic to tap.
“And thirdly, as a teacher, he would have had great power and influence
over young witches and wizards. Perhaps he had gained the idea from
Professor Slughorn, the teacher with whom he was on best terms, who had
demonstrated how influential a rol ofessor Binns slowly, “yes, one could argue that, I suppose.”
