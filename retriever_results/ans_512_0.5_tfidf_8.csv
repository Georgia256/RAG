sniggered, but Slughorn showed no dismay; on the contrary, he beamed and
looked from Hermione to Harry, who was sitting next to her.
“Oho! 
‘One of my best friends is Muggle-born, and she’s the best in our
year!’
 I’m assuming this is the very friend of whom you spoke, Harry?”
“Yes, sir,” said Harry.
“Well, well, take twenty well-earned points for Gryffindor, Miss Granger,”
said Slughorn genially.
Malfoy looked rather as he had done the time Hermione had punched him
in the face. Hermione turned to Harry wi e three Weasley boys, Harry, Hermione, and Ginny.
“All these yours, Arthur?”
“Oh no, only the redheads,” said Mr. Weasley, pointing out his children.
“This is Hermione, friend of Ron’s — and Harry, another friend —”
“Merlin’s beard,” said Amos Diggory, his eyes widening. “Harry? Harry
Potter
?”
“Er — yeah,” said Harry.
Harry was used to people looking curiously at him when they met him,
used to the way their eyes moved at once to the lightning scar on his forehead,
but it always made him feel uncomfortable. . Again, your readers will have to buy my book for the
whole story, but there is no question that Dumbledore took an unnatural
interest in Potter from the word go. Whether that was really in the boy’s
best interests — well, we’ll see. It’s certainly an open secret that Potter
has had a most troubled adolescence.”
I ask whether Skeeter is still in touch with Harry Potter, whom she so
famously interviewed last year: a breakthrough piece in which Potter
spoke exclusively of his conviction that You-Know-Who had ger? Granger? Can you possibly be related to Hector Dagworth-
Granger, who founded the Most Extraordinary Society of Potioneers?”
“No, I don’t think so, sir. I’m Muggle-born, you see.”
Harry saw Malfoy lean close to Nott and whisper something; both of them
sniggered, but Slughorn showed no dismay; on the contrary, he beamed and
looked from Hermione to Harry, who was sitting next to her.
“Oho! 
‘One of my best friends is Muggle-born, and she’s the best in our
year!’
 I’m assuming this is the very friend of w ed to have developed a close
friendship with the boy who brought around You-Know-Who’s fall
from power — thereby driving Hagrid’s own mother, like the rest of
You-Know-Who’s supporters, into hiding. Perhaps Harry Potter is
unaware of the unpleasant truth about his large friend — but Albus
Dumbledore surely has a duty to ensure that Harry Potter, along
with his fellow students, is warned about the dangers of associating
with part-giants.
Harry finished reading and looked up at Ron, whose mouth was hanging
op ore.
“Well, no, sir, because Ron got poisoned —”
“— which, naturally, made you forget all about trying to retrieve the
memory; I would have expected nothing else, while your best friend was in
danger. Once it became clear that Mr. Weasley was going to make a full
recovery, however, I would have hoped that you returned to the task I set you.
I thought I made it clear to you how very important that memory is. Indeed, I
did my best to impress upon you that it is the most crucial memory of all and
that we will  say you remember him at Hogwarts, Rosmerta,” murmured Professor
McGonagall. “Do you remember who his best friend was?”
“Naturally,” said Madam Rosmerta, with a small laugh. “Never saw one
without the other, did you? The number of times I had them in here — ooh,
they used to make me laugh. Quite the double act, Sirius Black and James
Potter!”
Harry dropped his tankard with a loud clunk. Ron kicked him.
“Precisely,” said Professor McGonagall. “Black and Potter. Ringleaders of
their little gang. Both very brig"

about nervously.
“Welcome to Hogwarts,” said Professor McGonagall. “The start-of-term
banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall,
you will be sorted into your Houses. The Sorting is a very importantceremony because, while you are here, your House will be something like
your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your
House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free time in your House
common room.
“The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuf he’s going to kill me
too. . . . You’ve got to help me, Remus. . . .”
Black’s face looked more skull-like than ever as he stared at Pettigrew with
his fathomless eyes.
“No one’s going to try and kill you until we’ve sorted a few things out,”
said Lupin.
“Sorted things out?” squealed Pettigrew, looking wildly about him once
more, eyes taking in the boarded windows and, again, the only door. “I knew
he’d come after me! I knew he’d be back for me! I’ve been waiting for this
for twelve years!”
“You knew Sirius   Harry again. “I was awake half the night thinking it all over, and I believe
it’s a plot to get the house.”
“The house?” repeated Harry. “What house?”
“

house!” shrieked Uncle Vernon, the vein in his forehead starting to
pulse. “
Our
 house! House prices are skyrocketing around here! You want us
out of the way and then you’re going to do a bit of hocus-pocus and before weknow it the deeds will be in your name and —”
“Are you out of your mind?” demanded Harry. “A plot to get this house?
Are you actual ,” Vernon Dursley said now, resuming his pacing up and
down the living room, “we — Petunia, Dudley, and I — are in danger. From

“Some of ‘my lot,’ right,” said Harry.
“Well, I don’t believe it,” repeated Uncle Vernon, coming to a halt in front
of Harry again. “I was awake half the night thinking it all over, and I believe
it’s a plot to get the house.”
“The house?” repeated Harry. “What house?”
“
This 
house!” shrieked Uncle Vernon, the vein in his forehead starting to
pulse. “
Our
 house! House p t you up here, if he knows you don’t like heights?” said
Harry, frowning.
“Master — master wants me to save him a seat, Harry Potter. He is very
busy,” said Winky, tilting her head toward the empty space beside her.
“Winky is wishing she is back in master’s tent, Harry Potter, but Winky does
what she is told. Winky is a good house-elf.”
She gave the edge of the box another frightened look and hid her eyes
completely again. Harry turned back to the others.
“So that’s a house-elf?” Ron muttered. “Weird things by, I says, and next thing I hear
you’s up in front of the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical
Creatures, like some common goblin.”“Well, it’s about time he had a bit of fun,” said Harry.
“House-elves is not supposed to have fun, Harry Potter,” said Winky
firmly, from behind her hands. “House-elves does what they is told. I is not
liking heights at all, Harry Potter” — she glanced toward the edge of the box
and gulped — “but my master sends me to the Top Box and I comes, sir.”

be sorted. He was placed in Slytherin House almost the moment that the
Sorting Hat touched his head,” continued Dumbledore, waving his blackened
hand toward the shelf over his head where the Sorting Hat sat, ancient and
unmoving. “How soon Riddle learned that the famous founder of the House

knowledge can only have excited him and increased his sense of self-
importance.

“Hang on, there’s a P.S. . . .”
I thought your friend Ron might like to keep this owl, as it’s my fault
he no longer has a rat.
Ron’s eyes widened. The minute owl was still hooting excitedly.
“Keep him?” he said uncertainly. He looked closely at the owl for a
moment; then, to Harry’s and Hermione’s great surprise, he held him out for
Crookshanks to sniff.
“What d’you reckon?” Ron asked the cat. “Definitely an owl?”Crookshanks purred.
“That’s good enough for me,” said Ron happily. “He’s  as though a large balloon was

wake up. The owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to attack Hagrid’scoat.
“Don’t do that.”
Harry tried to wave the owl out of the way, but it snapped its beak fiercely

The Keeper of the Keys  morning. 
He
 didn’t see the owls swooping past in broad daylight, though
people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl
after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl even at
nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning.
He yelled at five different people. He made several important telephone calls
and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he
thought he’d stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy hims ad only received
one note during the entire year he was sure, when the first owl landed with a
thud in front of him, that it had made a mistake.
“Who’re you after?” he asked it, languidly removing his orange juice from
underneath its beak and leaning forward to see the recipient’s name and
address: 
Harry Potter
Great Hall
Hogwarts School
 
Frowning, he made to take the letter from the owl, but before he could do
so, three, four, five more owls had fluttered down beside it and were
jockeying for position, t ldemort,” said Riddle softly, “is my past, present, and future, Harry
Potter. . . .”
He pulled Harry’s wand from his pocket and began to trace it through the
air, writing three shimmering words:
TOM MARVOLO RIDDLE
Then he waved the wand once, and the letters of his name rearranged
themselves:
I AM LORD VOLDEMORT
“You see?” he whispered. “It was a name I was already using at Hogwarts,
to my most intimate friends only, of course. You think I was going to use my
filthy Muggle father’s name forever? I, in whose  So I waited and watched. I used the map I had taken from Harry
Potter. The map that had almost ruined everything.”
“Map?” said Dumbledore quickly. “What map is this?”
“Potter’s map of Hogwarts. Potter saw me on it. Potter saw me stealing
more ingredients for the Polyjuice Potion from Snape’s office one night. He
thought I was my father. We have the same first name. I took the map from

And now Snape stood again in the headmaster’s study as Phineas Nigellus
came hurrying into his portrait.
“Headmaster! They are camping in the Forest of Dean! The Mudblood —”
“Do not use that word!”
“— the Granger girl, then, mentioned the place as she opened her bag and I
heard her!”
“Good. Very good!” cried the portrait of Dumbledore behind the
headmaster’s chair. “Now, Severus, the sword! Do not forget that it must be

Madam Marchbanks. ‘This is a further disgusting att  the Hogwarts Express to come

“What about Dumbledore’s funeral?” said Harry, speaking at last.
“Well . . .” said Professor McGonagall, losing a little of her briskness as her
voice shook. “I — I know that it was Dumbledore’s wish to be laid to rest

“Then that’s what’ll happen, isn’t it?” said Harry fiercely.
“If the Ministry thinks it appropriate,” said Professor McGonagall. “No

A large picture of a familiar, hook-nosed, black-haired man stared up at
them all, beneath a headline that read:

“No!” said Ron and Hermione loudly.
Hermione was quickest; she snatched up the newspaper and began to read
the accompanying story out loud.
“‘Severus Snape, long-standing Potions master at Hogwarts School of
Witchcraft and Wizardry, was today appointed headmaster in the most
important of several staffing changes at the ancient school.  he had just been appointed Head Boy. Harry didn’t realize what he was so
pleased about until the Potions lesson about two weeks after Dumbledore and
Hagrid had left, when, sitting right behind Malfoy, Harry overheard him
gloating to Crabbe and Goyle.
“I always thought Father might be the one who got rid of Dumbledore,” he
said, not troubling to keep his voice down. “I told you he thinks
Dumbledore’s the worst headmaster the school’s ever had. Maybe we’ll get a

hint. Harry, however, was completely lost.
“He hasn’t got a brother, has he?”
Dobby shook his head, his eyes wider than ever.
“Well then, I can’t think who else would have a chance of making horrible
things happen at Hogwarts,” said Harry. “I mean, there’s Dumbledore, for one
thing — you know who Dumbledore is, don’t you?”
Dobby bowed his head.
“Albus Dumbledore is the greatest headmaster Hogwarts has ever had.

Anthony Goldstein, his own wand would fly out of his hand, yet Anthony did
not seem to be making a sound. Harry did not have to look far for the solution
of the mystery, however; Fred and George were several feet from Smith and
taking it in turns to point their wands at his back.
“Sorry, Harry,” said George hastily, when Harry caught his eye. “Couldn’t
resist . . .”
Harry walked around the other pairs, trying to correct those who were
doing the spell wrong. Ginny was teamed with Michael Corner; s at all, but merely causing them to
jump backward a few paces or wince as the feeble spell whooshed over them.“Expelliarmus!” 
said Neville, and Harry, caught unawares, felt his wand
fly out of his hand.
“I DID IT!” said Neville gleefully. “I’ve never done it before — I DID IT!”
“Good one!” said Harry encouragingly, deciding not to point out that in a
real duel situation Neville’s opponent was unlikely to be staring in the
opposite direction with his wand held loosely at his side. “Listen, Neville, can

he’d fallen, he’d have died the same as if I’d used Avada Kedavra!
Expelliarmus saved me from Voldemort two years ago,” Harry added
defiantly. Lupin was reminding him of the sneering Hufflepuff Zacharias
Smith, who had jeered at Harry for wanting to teach Dumbledore’s Army how
to Disarm.
“Yes, Harry,” said Lupin with painful restraint, “and a great number of
Death Eaters witnessed that happening! Forgive me, but it was a very unusual
move then, idents — one . . . two . . . three —”
Harry swung his wand high, but Malfoy had already started on “two”: His
spell hit Harry so hard he felt as though he’d been hit over the head with a
saucepan. He stumbled, but everything still seemed to be working, and
wasting no more time, Harry pointed his wand straight at Malfoy and shouted,
“Rictusempra!”A jet of silver light hit Malfoy in the stomach and he doubled up, wheezing.
“I said Disarm only!”
 Lockhart shouted in alarm over the heads of the
battling crowd,  rmione, that’s all!”
“Dangling people upside down by the ankle?” said Hermione. “Who puts
their time and energy into making up spells like that?”
“Fred and George,” said Ron, shrugging, “it’s their kind of thing. And, er
—”
“My dad,” said Harry. He had only just remembered.
“What?” said Ron and Hermione together.
“My dad used this spell,” said Harry. “I — Lupin told me.”
This last part was not true; in fact, Harry had seen his father use the spell
on Snape, but he had never told Ron and Hermione about that  y just remembered.
“What?” said Ron and Hermione together.
“My dad used this spell,” said Harry. “I — Lupin told me.”
This last part was not true; in fact, Harry had seen his father use the spell
on Snape, but he had never told Ron and Hermione about that particular
excursion into the Pensieve. Now, however, a wonderful possibility occurred
to him. Could the Half-Blood Prince possibly be — ?

The word echoed all over the Hall as people wondered whether they had

you said —”
“Professor Snape, meanwhile,” said Dumbledore, raising his voice so that it
carried over all the muttering, “will be taking over the position of Defense
Against the Dark Arts teacher.”
“No!” said Harry,  We are also looking for new

The word echoed all over the Hall as people wondered whether they had

“Potions?” said Ron and Hermione t Percy.
“N-nothing.”
The pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder to shake off was the
feeling Harry had gotten from the teacher’s look — a feeling that he didn’t
like Harry at all.
“Who’s that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?” he asked Percy.
“Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder he’s looking so
nervous, that’s Professor Snape. He teaches Potions, but he doesn’t want to —
everyone knows he’s after Quirrell’s job. Knows an awful lot about the Dark

Harry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn’t look at him again.
At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to his
feet again. The hall fell silent.

“We can’t,” said Ron gloomily. “We keep all our old subjects, or I’d’ve
ditched Defense Against the Dark Arts.”
“But that’s very important!” said Hermione, shocked.
“Not the way Lockhart teaches it,” said Ron. “I haven’t learned anything

“Ooooh!” gasped Hermione, looking up at once. “Good luck! We’ll wait

“Hope it goes okay,” said Ron, and the pair of them watched Harry leave
through the portrait hole.
Harry proceeded through y had tea with Hagrid to look forward to, because the
Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so
far.
At the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the idea that Professor Snape
disliked him. By the end of the first Potions lesson, he knew he’d been wrong.
Snape didn’t dislike Harry — he

“Do not say the Dark Lord’s name!” 
spat Snape.
There was a nasty silence. They glared at each other across the Pensieve.
“Professor Dumbledore says his name,” said Harry quietly.
“Dumbledore is an extremely powerful wizard,” Snape muttered. “While
he 
may feel secure enough to use the name . . . the rest of us . . .” He rubbed
his left forearm, apparently unconsciously, on the spot where Harry knew the
Dark Mark was burned into his skin.
“I just wanted to know,” Harry began again, forcing his voice back s!”
The grave was extremely old, weathered so that Harry could hardly make
out the name. Hermione showed him the symbol beneath it.
“Harry, that’s the mark in the book!”
He peered at the place she indicated: The stone was so worn that it was
hard to make out what was engraved there, though there did seem to be a

“Yeah . . . it could be. . . .”
Hermione lit her wand and pointed it at the name on the headstone.
“It says Ig

Ignotus, I think. . . .”
“I’m go ised. “Why us?”
“I shall tell you that when we are somewhere more private,” said
Scrimgeour. “Is there such a place?” he demanded of Mr. Weasley.
“Yes, of course,” said Mr. Weasley, who looked nervous. “The, er, sitting
room, why don’t you use that?”
“You can lead the way,” Scrimgeour said to Ron. “There will be no need
for you to accompany us, Arthur.”
Harry saw Mr. Weasley exchange a worried look with Mrs. Weasley as he,Ron, and Hermione stood up. As they led the way back to the house in
silence, Harry kn"

“Information on the Order, if it was Snape.”
“But you’d think he’d already have all he needed, I mean, he was 
in 
the
Order, wasn’t he?”
“Well then,” said Harry, keen to discuss his theory, “what about
information on Dumbledore? The second page of this letter, for instance. You
know this Bathilda my mum mentions, you know who she is?”
“Who?”
“Bathilda Bagshot, the author of —”
“
A History of Magic,
” said Hermione, looking interested. “So your parents
knew her? She was an bledore? The second page of this letter, for instance. You
know this Bathilda my mum mentions, you know who she is?”
“Who?”
“Bathilda Bagshot, the author of —”
“
A History of Magic,
” said Hermione, looking interested. “So your parents
knew her? She was an incredible magical historian.”
“And she’s still alive,” said Harry, “and she lives in Godric’s Hollow, Ron’s
Auntie Muriel was talking about her at the wedding. She knew Dumbledore’s
family too. Be pretty interesting to talk to, wouldn’t she?”
There was a ould never talk to Rita Skeeter!” whispered Doge.
“Bathilda Bagshot?” Harry said. “The author of 
A History of Magic
?”
The name was printed on the front of one of Harry’s textbooks, though
admittedly not one of the ones he had read most attentively.
“Yes,” said Doge, clutching at Harry’s question like a drowning man at a
life belt. “A most gifted magical historian and an old friend of Albus’s.”
“Quite gaga these days, I’ve heard,” said Auntie Muriel cheerfully.
“If that is so, it is even more dishonorable  y short, and looked as though it had been scrawled in a
great hurry. Harry read it aloud:
Harry —
I’m flying north immediately. This news about your scar is the
latest in a series of strange rumors that have reached me here. If it
hurts again, go straight to Dumbledore — they’re saying he’s got
Mad-Eye out of retirement, which means he’s reading the signs,
even if no one else is.
I’ll be in touch soon. My best to Ron and Hermione. Keep your
eyes open, Harry.
Harry looked up at Ron and Hermione, who stared b  but there was no answer.
“He’s not out, is he?” said Hermione, who was shivering under her cloak.
Ron had his ear to the door.
“There’s a weird noise,” he said. “Listen — is that Fang?”
Harry and Hermione put their ears to the door too. From inside the cabincame a series of low, throbbing moans.
“Think we’d better go and get someone?” said Ron nervously.
“Hagrid!” called Harry, thumping the door. “Hagrid, are you in there?”
There was a sound of heavy footsteps, then the door creaked open. Hagrid
stood ther on,

was tugging him backward.
“What’s the matter?” Harry said, startled to see her face so white and
terrified.
“It’s the Dark Mark, Harry!” Hermione moaned, pulling him as hard as she
could. “You-Know-Who’s sign!”
“Voldemort’s — ?”
“Harry, come 
on
!”
Harry turned — Ron was hurriedly scooping up his miniature Krum — the
three of them started across the clearing — but before they had taken a few
hurried steps, a series of popping noises announced the  piteous moan — go on, Harry —
higher than that — good — the fur vanished — the fangs shrank — and he
turned back into a man. Simple, yet effective — and another village will
remember me forever as the hero who delivered them from the monthly terror
of werewolf attacks.”

“I hope the others make it in time,” said Mrs. Weasley anxiously, staring
behind her at the wrought-iron arch spanning the platform, through which
new arrivals would come.
“Nice dog, Harry!” called a tall boy with dreadlocks.
“Thanks, Lee,” said Harr  they leaned
casually against the barrier, chatting unconcernedly, and slid sideways
through it . . . and as they did so, platform nine and three-quarters
materialized in front of them.
The Hogwarts Express, a gleaming scarlet steam engine, was already there,
clouds of steam billowing from it, through which the many Hogwarts students
and parents on the platform appeared like dark ghosts. Pigwidgeon became
noisier than ever in response to the hooting of many owls through the mist.

that had just arrived at platform nine. With a meaningful look at Harry, he
leaned casually against the barrier. Harry imitated him.
In a moment, they had fallen sideways through the solid metal onto
platform nine and three-quarters and looked up to see the Hogwarts Express, a
scarlet steam engine, puffing smoke over a platform packed with witches and
wizards seeing their children onto the train.
Percy and Ginny suddenly appeared behind Harry. They were panting and
had apparently taken the barrier at time than Sirius scaring a couple of cats
for Harry’s entertainment. Once inside the station they lingered casually
beside the barrier between platforms nine and ten until the coast was clear,
then each of them leaned against it in turn and fell easily through onto
platform nine and three quarters, where the Hogwarts Express stood belching
sooty steam over a platform packed with departing students and their families.Harry inhaled the familiar smell and felt his spirits soar. . . . He was really
going back.  dumped Harry’s
trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him. Harry thought this
was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, facing the platforms
with a nasty grin on his face.
“Well, there you are, boy. Platform nine — platform ten. Your platform
should be somewhere in the middle, but they don’t seem to have built it yet,
do they?”
He was quite right, of course. There was a big plastic number nine over one
platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it, and in the
middle, can walk, thanks,” said Harry irritably, jerking his arm out of the Auror’s
grip. He pushed his trolley directly at the solid barrier, ignoring his silent
companion, and found himself, a second later, standing on platform nine and
three-quarters, where the scarlet Hogwarts Express stood belching steam over
the crowd.
Hermione and the Weasleys joined him within seconds. Without waiting to
consult his grim-faced Auror, Harry motioned to Ron and Hermione to follow
him up the platform, looking for an empty comp 
It didn’t come . . . he kept on running . . . he opened his eyes.
A scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people.
A sign overhead said Hogwarts Express, eleven o’clock. Harry looked behind
him and saw a wrought-iron archway where the barrier had been, with the
words 
Platform Nine and Three-Quarters
 on it. He had done it.
Smoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd,while cats of every color wound here and there between their legs. Owls
hooted to one anoth and all too soon, the Hogwarts
Express was pulling in at platform nine and three-quarters. The usual
confusion and noise filled the corridors as the students began to disembark.Ron and Hermione struggled out past Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, carrying
their trunks. Harry, however, stayed put.
“Fred — George — wait a moment.”
The twins turned. Harry pulled open his trunk and drew out his Triwizard
winnings.
“Take it,” he said, and he thrust the sack into George’s hands.
“What?” said Fred, looking flabbergasted."
What is the name of Harry's godfather?,Sirius Black,The name of Harry's godfather is Sirius Black.," Harry bid him
and Hermione good-bye, then wheeled the trolley bearing his trunk and
Hedwig’s cage toward Uncle Vernon, who greeted him in his usual fashion.
“What’s that?” he snarled, staring at the envelope Harry was still clutching
in his hand. “If it’s another form for me to sign, you’ve got another —”
“It’s not,” said Harry cheerfully. “It’s a letter from my godfather.”
“Godfather?” spluttered Uncle Vernon. “You haven’t got a godfather!”
“Yes, I have,” said Harry brightly. “He was my mum and dad’s best  another form for me to sign, you’ve got another —”
“It’s not,” said Harry cheerfully. “It’s a letter from my godfather.”
“Godfather?” spluttered Uncle Vernon. “You haven’t got a godfather!”
“Yes, I have,” said Harry brightly. “He was my mum and dad’s best friend.
He’s a convicted murderer, but he’s broken out of Wizard prison and he’s on
the run. He likes to keep in touch with me, though . . . keep up with my
news . . . check if I’m happy. . . .”
And, grinning broadly at the look of horror on Uncle Vernon’ rs of his name rearranged
themselves:
I AM LORD VOLDEMORT
“You see?” he whispered. “It was a name I was already using at Hogwarts,
to my most intimate friends only, of course. You think I was going to use my
filthy Muggle father’s name forever? I, in whose veins runs the blood of
Salazar Slytherin himself, through my mother’s side? I, keep the name of a
foul, common Muggle, who abandoned me even before I was born, just
because he found out his wife was a witch? No, Harry — I fashioned myself a
new name, a n your account at Gringotts, and you inherit
all of Sirius’s personal possessions. The slightly problematic part of the
legacy —”
“His godfather’s dead?” said Uncle Vernon loudly from the sofa.
Dumbledore and Harry both turned to look at him. The glass of mead was
now knocking quite insistently on the side of Vernon’s head; he attempted to
beat it away. “He’s dead? His godfather?”
“Yes,” said Dumbledore. He did not ask Harry why he had not confided in
the Dursleys. “Our problem,” he continued to Harry, as if  have told him, so my
big disguise is useless. There’s not much I can do for the Order of the
Phoenix . . . or so Dumbledore feels.”
There was something about the slightly flattened tone of voice in which
Sirius uttered Dumbledore’s name that told Harry that Sirius was not very
happy with the headmaster either. Harry felt a sudden upsurge of affection for
his godfather.
“At least you’ve known what’s been going on,” he said bracingly.
“Oh yeah,” said Sirius sarcastically. “Listening to Snape’s reports, having an old badge that
flickered feebly between

 and

a cracked and worn-out Sneakoscope, and a gold locket inside which a note
signed R.A.B. had been hidden, he finally discovered the sharp edge that had
done the damage. He recognized it at once. It was a two-inch-long fragment

of the enchanted mirror that his dead godfather, Sirius, had given him. Harry
laid it aside and felt cautiously around the trunk for the rest, but nothing more
remained of his godfather’s last gift except powdered glass, which clung to
the deepest layer of debris like glittering grit.
Harry sat up and examined the jagged piece on which he had cut himself,
seeing nothing but his own bright green eye reflected back at him. Then he
placed the fragment ?”
“Do not say the Dark Lord’s name!” 
spat Snape.
There was a nasty silence. They glared at each other across the Pensieve.
“Professor Dumbledore says his name,” said Harry quietly.
“Dumbledore is an extremely powerful wizard,” Snape muttered. “While
he 
may feel secure enough to use the name . . . the rest of us . . .” He rubbed
his left forearm, apparently unconsciously, on the spot where Harry knew the
Dark Mark was burned into his skin.
“I just wanted to know,” Harry began again, forcing his voice back"
Who is the gamekeeper at Hogwarts?,Rubeus Hagrid,The gamekeeper at Hogwarts is Rubeus Hagrid.,"or of

,” said Lupin.
“At least he’s still alive!” muttered Ron.
“We have also heard within the last few hours that Rubeus Hagrid” — all
three of them gasped, and so nearly missed the rest of the sentence — “well-
known gamekeeper at Hogwarts School, has narrowly escaped arrest within
the grounds of Hogwarts, where he is rumored to have hosted a ‘Support
Harry Potter’ party in his house. However, Hagrid was not taken into custody,
and is, we believe, on the run.”
“I suppose it helps, when escap ditch, the most popular sport in the magical world — highly
dangerous, very exciting, and played on broomsticks. Harry happened to be a
very good Quidditch player; he had been the youngest person in a century to
be picked for one of the Hogwarts House teams. One of Harry’s most prized
possessions was his Nimbus Two Thousand racing broom.
Harry put the leather case aside and picked up his last parcel. He
recognized the untidy scrawl on the brown paper at once: This was from
Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper. H the Dark Arts, a decision that caused many raised eyebrows
at the Ministry of Magic, given Moody’s well-known habit of
attacking anybody who makes a sudden movement in his presence.
Mad-Eye Moody, however, looks responsible and kindly when set
beside the part-human Dumbledore employs to teach Care ofMagical Creatures.
Rubeus Hagrid, who admits to being expelled from Hogwarts in
his third year, has enjoyed the position of gamekeeper at the school
ever since, a job secured for him by Dumbledore. Last year,
ho hose friends of Harry Potter’s who are
suffering for their allegiance?” Lee was saying.
“Well, as regular listeners will know, several of the more outspoken
supporters of Harry Potter have now been imprisoned, including Xenophilius
Lovegood, erstwhile editor of 
The Quibbler
,” said Lupin.
“At least he’s still alive!” muttered Ron.
“We have also heard within the last few hours that Rubeus Hagrid” — all
three of them gasped, and so nearly missed the rest of the sentence — “well-
known gamekeeper at Hogwarts  is hood up.”
Harry sank down next to the bowl of peas.
“What did you talk to him about, Hagrid? Did you mention Hogwarts at
all?”
“Mighta come up,” said Hagrid, frowning as he tried to remember.
“Yeah . . . he asked what I did, an’ I told him I was gamekeeper here. . . . He
asked a bit about the sorta creatures I look after . . . so I told him . . . an’ I said
what I’d always really wanted was a dragon . . . an’ then . . . I can’ remember
too well, ’cause he kept buyin’ me drinks. . . . Let’s see . . . yeah  up, I can tell you. Our
kind have to keep putting spells on Muggles who’ve spotted them, to make
them forget.”
“So what on earth’s Hagrid up to?” said Hermione.
When they knocked on the door of the gamekeeper’s hut an hour later, they
were surprised to see that all the curtains were closed. Hagrid called “Who is
it?” before he let them in, and then shut the door quickly behind them.
It was stifling hot inside. Even though it was such a warm day, there was a
blazing fire in the grate. Hagrid made them tea a  Hogwarts
gamekeeper, Hagrid.
Dobby blinked anxiously up at Harry.
“Harry Potter mustn’t be angry. . . . Dobby hoped . . . if Harry Potter
thought his friends had forgotten him . . . Harry Potter might not want to go
back to school, sir. . . .”
Harry wasn’t listening. He made a grab for the letters, but Dobby jumpedout of reach.
“Harry Potter will have them, sir, if he gives Dobby his word that he will
not return to Hogwarts. Ah, sir, this is a danger you must not face! Say you
won’t go back, sir!”

What position does Harry play on his Quidditch team?,Seeker,"According to the passage, Harry does not play Quidditch at all, as he is unfamiliar with the sport."," at the Hedwig-free sky.
“Come and have a game of Quidditch in the orchard, Harry,” said Ron.
“Come on — three on three, Bill and Charlie and Fred and George will
play. . . . You can try out the Wronski Feint. . . .”
“Ron,” said Hermione, in an I-don’t-think-you’re-being-very-sensitive sortof voice, “Harry doesn’t want to play Quidditch right now. . . . He’s worried,
and he’s tired. . . . We all need to go to bed. . . .”
“Yeah, I want to play Quidditch,” said Harry suddenly. “Hang on, I’ll get
my Firebolt.” tting me one and I’ll
smuggle it in somehow.”
Harry was strongly reminded of Dudley.“Have 
you
 got your own broom?” the boy went on.
“No,” said Harry.
“Play Quidditch at all?”
“No,” Harry said again, wondering what on earth Quidditch could be.
“
I
 do — Father says it’s a crime if I’m not picked to play for my House,
and I must say, I agree. Know what House you’ll be in yet?”
“No,” said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute.
“Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know I’ll be
in or Quidditch team to re-form? How you took the case to
Dumbledore, who insisted that the team be allowed to play? Well, now, I
couldn’t have that. I contacted the Minister at once, and he quite agreed with
me that the High Inquisitor has to have the power to strip pupils of privileges,
or she — that is to say, I — would have less authority than common teachers!
And you see now, don’t you, Minerva, how right I was in attempting to stop
the Gryffindor team re-forming? 
Dreadful
 tempers . . . Anyway, I was re s just what we were discussing,” said Harry. “We don’t know.”
“Someone couldn’ have a grudge against the Gryffindor Quidditch team,
could they?” said Hagrid anxiously. “Firs’ Katie, now Ron . . .”
“I can’t see anyone trying to bump off a Quidditch team,” said George.
“Wood might’ve done the Slytherins if he could’ve got away with it,” said
Fred fairly.
“Well, I don’t think it’s Quidditch, but I think there’s a connection between
the attacks,” said Hermione quietly.
“How d’you work that out?” asked Fred.
“We nk-you’re-being-very-sensitive sortof voice, “Harry doesn’t want to play Quidditch right now. . . . He’s worried,
and he’s tired. . . . We all need to go to bed. . . .”
“Yeah, I want to play Quidditch,” said Harry suddenly. “Hang on, I’ll get
my Firebolt.”
Hermione left the room, muttering something that sounded very much like
“Boys.”
Neither Mr. Weasley nor Percy was at home much over the following week.
Both left the house each morning before the rest of the family got up, and
returned well after dinner e g up.
“Walking,” Ron mumbled. He was still wearing his Quidditch things.
“You look frozen,” said Hermione. “Come and sit down!”
Ron walked to the fireside and sank into the chair farthest from Harry’s, not
looking at him. The stolen Snitch zoomed over their heads.
“I’m sorry,” Ron mumbled, looking at his feet.
“What for?” said Harry.
“For thinking I can play Quidditch,” said Ron. “I’m going to resign first
thing tomorrow.”
“If you resign,” said Harry testily, “there’ll only be three players left on the
team ight
overtake Slytherin.”
The rest of the team landed next to George to complain, too.
“It’s not 
my
 fault,” said Wood. “We’ve just got to make sure we play a
clean game, so Snape hasn’t got an excuse to pick on us.”
Which was all very well, thought Harry, but he had another reason for not
wanting Snape near him while he was playing Quidditch. . . .
The rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of
practice, but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common room,
where he f he damage, but Harry swore to himself not to
meddle in things that weren’t his business from now on. He’d had it with
sneaking around and spying. He felt so ashamed of himself that he went to
Wood and offered to resign from the Quidditch team.
“Resign?”
 Wood thundered. “What good’ll that do? How are we going toget any points back if we can’t win at Quidditch?”
But even Quidditch had lost its fun. The rest of the team wouldn’t speak to
Harry during practice, and if they had to speak about him, they called h"

“That does look good,” said the ghost in the ruff sadly, watching Harry cut
up his steak.
“Can’t you — ?”
“I haven’t eaten for nearly five hundred years,” said the ghost. “I don’t

bottom of the stairs, where Nearly Headless Nick, ghost of Gryffindor Tower,
stood waiting for him.
“Harry! My dear boy!”Nick made to grasp Harry’s hands with both of his own: Harry’s felt as
though they had been thrust into icy water.
“Nick, you’ve got to help me. Who’s the ghost of Ravenclaw Tower?”
Nearly Headless Nick looked surprised and a little offended.
“The Gray Lady, of course; but if it is ghostly services you require — ?”
“It’s got to be her — d’you know where she is?”
“Let’s see. . .  the last word to the whole hall. He took off the
hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table. He was so relieved to
have been chosen and not put in Slytherin, he hardly noticed that he was
getting the loudest cheer yet. Percy the Prefect got up and shook his hand
vigorously, while the Weasley twins yelled, “We got Potter! We got Potter!”
Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff he’d seen earlier. The ghost
patted his arm, giving Harry the sudden, horrible feeling he’d just plunged it

“Dumbledore wouldn’t come back as a ghost,” said Harry. There was little
about Dumbledore he was sure of now, but he knew that much. “He would

He was gone from the hall, he was locked in the coils of a creature with red
eyes, so tightly bound that Harry did not know where his body ended and the
creature’s began. They were fused together, bound by pain, and there was no
escape —
And when the creature spoke, it used Harry’s mouth, so that in his agony he
felt his jaw move. . . .

CHAPTER  TWELVE
THE TRI out Karkaroff?”
“Karkaroff did not steer,” said a gruff voice. “He stayed in his cabin and let
us do the vork.”
Krum had come to say good-bye to Hermione.
“Could I have a vord?” he asked her.
“Oh . . . yes . . . all right,” said Hermione, looking slightly flustered, and
following Krum through the crowd and out of sight.
“You’d better hurry up!” Ron called loudly after her. “The carriages’ll be
here in a minute!”
He let Harry keep a watch for the carriages, however, and spent the next
few minutes craning his flustered, and

“You’d better hurry up!” Ron called loudly after her. “The carriages’ll be

He let Harry keep a watch for the carriages, however, and spent the next
few minutes craning his neck over the crowd to try and see what Krum and
Hermione might be up to. They returned quite soon. Ron stared at Hermione,
but her face was quite impassive.
“I liked Diggory,” said Krum abruptly to Harry. “He vos alvays polite to

creature on the bed had large, bat-like ears and bulging green eyes the
size of tennis balls. Harry knew instantly that this was what had been
watching him out of the garden hedge that morning.
As they stared at each other, Harry heard Dudley’s voice from the hall.
“May I take your coats, Mr. and Mrs. Mason?”
The creature slipped off the bed and bowed so low that the end of its long,
thin nose touched the carpet. Harry noticed that it was wearing what looked

“May I take your coats, Mr. and Mrs. Mason?”
The creature slipped off the bed and bowed so low that the end of its long,
thin nose touched the carpet. Harry noticed that it was wearing what looked
like an old pillowcase, with rips for arm- and leg-holes.
“Er — hello,” said Harry nervously.
“Harry Potter!” said the creature in a high-pitched voice Harry was sure
would carry down the stairs. “So long has Dobby wanted to meet you, sir . . .
Such an honor it is. . . .”
“Th-thank you,” sai uld come when you have to
make a choice between what is right and what is easy, remember what
happened to a boy who was good, and kind, and brave, because he strayed
across the path of Lord Voldemort. Remember Cedric Diggory.”
Harry’s trunk was packed; Hedwig was back in her cage on top of it. He, Ron,
and Hermione were waiting in the crowded entrance hall with the rest of the
fourth years for the carriages that would take them back to Hogsmeade
station. It was another beautiful summer’s day. He supposed th"

screech and was beating her wings wildly against the bars of her cage.“Dobby had to punish himself, sir,” said the elf, who had gone slightly
cross-eyed. “Dobby almost spoke ill of his family, sir. . . .”
“Your family?”
“The wizard family Dobby serves, sir. . . . Dobby is a house-elf — bound to
serve one house and one family forever. . . .”
“Do they know you’re here?” asked Harry curiously.
Dobby shuddered.
“Oh, no, sir, no . . . Dobby will have to punish himself most grievou  wishing we had a house-elf to do the ironing,” said
George. “But all we’ve got is a lousy old ghoul in the attic and gnomes all

best of everything, his family was rolling in wizard gold; he could just see
Malfoy strutting around a large manor house. Sending the family servant to

thoughtful, and sensitive boy.
“I don’t know whether the Malfoys own a house-elf. . . .” said Harry.
“Well, whoever owns him will be an old Wizarding family, and they’ll be
rich,” said Fred.
“Yeah, Mum’s always wishing we had a house-elf to do the ironing,” said
George. “But all we’ve got is a lousy old ghoul in the attic and gnomes all

magic out of school? I suppose you’ve forgotten the Hover Charm he used
three years ago —”
“That wasn’t me, it was a house-elf!” said Harry.
“YOU SEE?” roared Fudge, gesturing flamboyantly in Harry’s direction.
“A house-elf! In a Muggle house! I ask you —”
“The house-elf in question is currently in the employ of Hogwarts School,”
said Dumbledore. “I can summon him here in an instant to g ng around to
look at Harry, “Lucius Malfoy came back saying he’d never meant any of it.

Harry had heard these rumors about Malfoy’s family before, and they
didn’t surprise him at all. Malfoy made Dudley Dursley look like a kind,
thoughtful, and sensitive boy.

“What are you?” but thought it would sound too rude, so instead he said,“Who are you?”
“Dobby, sir. Just Dobby. Dobby the house-elf,” said the creature.
“Oh — really?” said Harry. “Er — I don’t want to be rude or anything, but

best of everything, his family was rolling in wizard gold; he could just see
Malfoy strutting around a large manor house. Sending the family servant to
stop Harry from going back to Hogwarts also sounded exactly like the sort of
thing Malfoy would do. Had Harry been stupid to take Dobby seriously?

Who is the Half-Blood Prince?,Severus Snape,"The Half-Blood Prince is a mysterious figure who is the author of a set of notes that Harry Potter finds in his potions textbook. The identity of the Half-Blood Prince is not explicitly revealed in the book, leaving it to the reader's interpretation.","n of his father had reminded him that there was something he
had been looking forward to asking Lupin.
“Have you ever heard of someone called the Half-Blood Prince?”
“The Half-Blood what?”
“Prince,” said Harry, watching him closely for signs of recognition.
“There are no Wizarding princes,” said Lupin, now smiling. “Is this a title
you’re thinking of adopting? I should have thought being ‘the Chosen One’
would be enough.”
“It’s nothing to do with me!” said Harry indignantly. “The Half-Blood

“Well, why not? Harry, there aren’t any real princes in the Wizarding
world! It’s either a nickname, a made-up title somebody’s given themselves,
or it could be their actual name, couldn’t it? No, listen! If, say, her father wasa wizard whose surname was Prince, and her mother was a Muggle, then that
would make her a ‘half-blood Prince’!”
“Yeah, very ingenious, Hermione . . .”
“But it would! Maybe she was proud of being half a Prince!”

“But it would! Maybe she was proud of being half a Prince!”
“Listen, Hermione, I can tell it’s not a girl. I can just tell.”
“The truth is that you don’t think a girl would have been clever enough,”
said Hermione angrily.
“How can I have hung round with you for five years and not think girls are
clever?” said Harry, stung by this. “It . “Can I borrow your quill for the
conclusion?”
Harry, who had found nothing useful in the Half-Blood Prince’s notes so
far, looked around; the three of them were now the only ones left in the
common room, Seamus having just gone up to bed cursing Snape and his
essay. The only sounds were the crackling of the fire and Ron scratching out
one last paragraph on dementors using Hermione’s quill. Harry had just
closed the Half-Blood Prince’s book, yawning, when —
Crack.
Hermione let out a little shriek; Ron spil lem’ in company. Many people were under the
impression that I owned a badly behaved rabbit.”
He accepted a glass of eggnog from Mr. Weasley with a word of thanks,
looking slightly more cheerful. Harry, meanwhile, felt a rush of excitement:
This last mention of his father had reminded him that there was something he
had been looking forward to asking Lupin.
“Have you ever heard of someone called the Half-Blood Prince?”
“The Half-Blood what?”
“Prince,” said Harry, watching him closely for signs of recognition as the instructions that had won him his
bottle of Felix Felicis, now safely hidden inside a pair of socks in his trunk
upstairs.

CHAPTER  TEN
THE HOUSE OF GAUNT
or the rest of the week’s Potions lessons Harry continued to follow the
Half-Blood Prince’s instructions wherever they deviated from Libatius
Borage’s, with the result that by their fourth lesson Slughorn was raving about
Harry’s abilities, saying that he had rarely taught anyone so talented. N rmione, meanwhile, was resolutely plowing on
with what she called the “official” instructions, but becoming increasingly
bad-tempered as they yielded poorer results than the Prince’s.
Harry wondered vaguely who the Half-Blood Prince had been. Although
the amount of homework they had been given prevented him from reading the
whole of his copy of 
Advanced Potion-Making,
 he had skimmed through it
sufficiently to see that there was barely a page on which the Prince had not
made additional notes, not all of th even saying the name again.
“What about him?” asked Harry heavily, slumping back in his chair.
“Well, it’s just that I was sort of right about the Half-Blood Prince
business,” she said tentatively.
“D’you have to rub it in, Hermione? How d’you think I feel about that
now?”
“No — no — Harry, I didn’t mean that!” she said hastily, looking around to
check that they were not being overheard. “It’s just that I was right about
Eileen Prince once owning the book. You see . . . she was Snape’s mother!”

Harry. “Are you sure? Well then, the Dark Lord must be informed at once!”
She dragged back her left sleeve: Harry saw the Dark Mark burned into the
flesh of her arm, and knew that she was about to touch it, to summon her
beloved master —
“I was about to call him!” said Lucius, and his hand actually closed upon
Bellatrix’s wrist, preventing her from touching the Mark. “

by Gryffindor or Ravenclaw. Four objects from the four founders would, I am
sure, have exerted a powerful pull over Voldemort’s imagination. I cannot
answer for whether he ever managed to find anything of Ravenclaw’s. I am
confident, however, that the only known relic of Gryffindor remains safe.”

“Yes,” said Dumbledore, smiling, “I would be prepared to bet — perhaps
not my other hand — but a couple of fingers, that they became Horcruxes

six, are more of a problem, but I will hazard a guess that, having secured

sure, have exerted a powerful pull over Vold self for what lay ahead.
Tired of walking in on Harry, Hermione, and Ron all over the school,Professor McGonagall had given them permission to use the empty
Transfiguration classroom at lunchtimes. Harry had soon mastered the
Impediment Curse, a spell to slow down and obstruct attackers; the Reductor
Curse, which would enable him to blast solid objects out of his way; and the
Four-Point Spell, a useful discovery of Hermione’s that would make his wand

what he did to Rowle and Dolohov?”
“What about the Mudblood, then?” growled Greyback. Harry was nearly
thrown off his feet as the Snatchers forced the prisoners to swivel around
again, so that the l ther looked beside himself with
excitement, Draco’s expression was full of reluctance, even fear.
“I don’t know,” he said, and he walked away toward the fireplace where his
mother stood watching.
“We had better be certain, Lucius,” Narcissa called to her husband in her
cold, clear voice. “Completely sure that it is Potter, before we summon the
Dark Lord . . . They say this is his” — she was looking closely at the
blackthorn wand — “but it does not resemble Ollivander’s description. . . . If

CHAPTER  TWENTY-ONE
THE UNKNOWABLE ROOM
arry wracked his brains over the next week as to how he was to
persuade Slughorn to hand over the true memory, b was still fighting his way across the
lake with the first years; Professor McGonagall was presumably supervisingthe drying of the entrance hall floor, but there was another empty chair too,
and Harry couldn’t think who else was missing.
“Where’s the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher?” said Hermione,
who was also looking up at the teachers.
They had never yet had a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher who had
lasted more than three terms. Harry’s favorite by far had been Professor
Lupin, who had res fense Against the Dark Arts teacher?” said Hermione,
who was also looking up at the teachers.
They had never yet had a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher who had
lasted more than three terms. Harry’s favorite by far had been Professor
Lupin, who had resigned last year. He looked up and down the staff table.
There was definitely no new face there.
“Maybe they couldn’t get anyone!” said Hermione, looking anxious.
Harry scanned the table more carefully. Tiny little Professor Flitwick, the
Charms teacher, wa ogether, turning to stare at Harry. “But
you said —”
“Professor Snape, meanwhile,” said Dumbledore, raising his voice so that it
carried over all the muttering, “will be taking over the position of Defense
Against the Dark Arts teacher.”
“No!” said Harry, so loudly that many heads turned in his direction. He didnot care; he was staring up at the staff table, incensed. How could Snape be
given the Defense Against the Dark Arts job after all this time? Hadn’t it been
widely known for years that Dumbledore did their Defense

harder than they are doing at pres —”“What does it matter?” said Malfoy. “Defense Against the Dark Arts — it’s
all just a joke, isn’t it, an act? Like any of us need protecting against the Dark
Arts —”
“It is an act that is crucial to success, Draco!” said Snape. “Where do you
think I would have been all these years, if I had not known how to act? Now
listen to me! You are being incautious, wandering around at night aid, “That’s an idea.”“What’s an idea?” said Harry.
“You,” said Ron. “Teaching us to do it.”
“But . . .”
Harry was grinning now, sure the pair of them were pulling his leg.
“But I’m not a teacher, I can’t —”
“Harry, you’re the best in the year at Defense Against the Dark Arts,” said
Hermione.
“Me?” said Harry, now grinning more broadly than ever. “No I’m not,
you’ve beaten me in every test —”
“Actually, I haven’t,” said Hermione coolly. “You beat me in our third year
— the only year we both sat the test and so loudly that many heads turned in his direction. He didnot care; he was staring up at the staff table, incensed. How could Snape be
given the Defense Against the Dark Arts job after all this time? Hadn’t it been
widely known for years that Dumbledore did not trust him to do it?
“But Harry, you said that Slughorn was going to be teaching Defense
Against the Dark Arts!” said Hermione.
“I thought he was!” said Harry, racking his brains to remember when
Dumbledore had told him this, but now that he came to th he teaches?” said Ron, frowning at Professor Lupin’s pallid
profile.
“That’s obvious,” whispered Hermione. “There’s only one vacancy, isn’t
there? Defense Against the Dark Arts.”
Harry, Ron, and Hermione had already had two Defense Against the Dark
Arts teachers, both of whom had lasted only one year. There were rumors that
the job was jinxed.
“Well, I hope he’s up to it,” said Ron doubtfully. “He looks like one good
hex would finish him off, doesn’t he? Anyway . . .” He turned to Harry.
“What were you goin"
What is the name of the three-headed dog that guards the Philosopher's Stone?,Fluffy,The three-headed dog that guards the Philosopher's Stone is named Fluffy.,". The Probes,
Harry knew, detected spells of concealment and hidden magical objects.
Knowing that he had only seconds, Harry pointed Draco’s wand at each of the
guards in turn and murmured, 
“Confundo”
 twice. Unnoticed by Travers, who
was looking through the bronze doors at the inner hall, each of the guards
gave a little start as the spells hit them.
Hermione’s long black hair rippled behind her as she climbed the steps.
“One moment, madam,” said the guard, raising his Probe.
“But you’ve just done that!”   knew you’d seen me coming to look at what was guarding
the Stone.”
“
You
 let the troll in?”
“Certainly. I have a special gift with trolls — you must have seen what I
did to the one in the chamber back there? Unfortunately, while everyone else
was running around looking for it, Snape, who already suspected me, went
straight to the third floor to head me off — and not only did my troll fail to
beat you to death, that three-headed dog didn’t even manage to bite Snape’s
leg off properly.
“Now, wait quietly, P ht into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a dog thatfilled the whole space between ceiling and floor. It had three heads. Three
pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching and quivering in their
direction; three drooling mouths, saliva hanging in slippery ropes from
yellowish fangs.
It was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and Harry knew that
the only reason they weren’t already dead was that their sudden appearance
had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over that, there wa a nightmare — this was too much, on top of everything
that had happened so far.
They weren’t in a room, as he had supposed. They were in a corridor. The
forbidden corridor on the third floor. And now they knew why it was
forbidden.
They were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a dog thatfilled the whole space between ceiling and floor. It had three heads. Three
pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching and quivering in their
direction; three drooling mouths, saliva hanging in slipper are you okay?”
“Where’s the dog?”
“Not a dog,” Ron moaned. His teeth were gritted with pain. “Harry, it’s a
trap —”
“What —”
“He’s the dog . . . he’s an Animagus. . . .”
Ron was staring over Harry’s shoulder. Harry wheeled around. With a snap,
the man in the shadows closed the door behind them.
A mass of filthy, matted hair hung to his elbows. If eyes hadn’t been
shining out of the deep, dark sockets, he might have been a corpse. The waxy
skin was stretched so tightly over the bones of his face, it looked l  around looking for it, Snape, who already suspected me, went
straight to the third floor to head me off — and not only did my troll fail to
beat you to death, that three-headed dog didn’t even manage to bite Snape’s
leg off properly.
“Now, wait quietly, Potter. I need to examine this interesting mirror.”
It was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell. It
was the Mirror of Erised.
“This mirror is the key to finding the Stone,” Quirrell murmured, tapping
his way around the frame. “Tru ts paws and fell to its knees,
then it slumped to the ground, fast asleep.
“Keep playing,” Ron warned Harry as they slipped out of the Cloak and
crept toward the trapdoor. They could feel the dog’s hot, smelly breath as they
approached the giant heads.
“I think we’ll be able to pull the door open,” said Ron, peering over the
dog’s back. “Want to go first, Hermione?”
“No, I don’t!”“All right.” Ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dog’s legs.
He bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor, which  g your broomstick, muttering, he wouldn’t take his eyes off you.”
“Rubbish,” said Hagrid, who hadn’t heard a word of what had gone on next
to him in the stands. “Why would Snape do somethin’ like that?”
Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another, wondering what to tell
him. Harry decided on the truth.
“I found out something about him,” he told Hagrid. “He tried to get past
that three-headed dog on Halloween. It bit him. We think he was trying to
steal whatever it’s guarding.”
Hagrid dropped the teapot.
"
What creature is Aragog?,Acromantula,"Aragog is a Acromantula, a type of giant spider.","spects to Aragog too,” said Harry. “He’s gone to change into
something more suitable, I think . . . and he said he’d bring some bottles so
we can drink to Aragog’s memory. . . .”
“Did he?” said Hagrid, looking both astonished and touched. “Tha’s —
tha’s righ’ nice of him, that is, an’ not turnin’ yeh in either. I’ve never really
had a lot ter do with Horace Slughorn before. . . . Comin’ ter see old Aragog
off, though, eh? Well . . . he’d’ve liked that, Aragog would. . . .”
Harry thought privately that what  pes shifted all around him.
“The thing that lives in the castle,” said Aragog, “is an ancient creature we
spiders fear above all others. Well do I remember how I pleaded with Hagrid
to let me go, when I sensed the beast moving about the school.”
“What is it?” said Harry urgently.
More loud clicking, more rustling; the spiders seemed to be closing in.
“We do not speak of it!” said Aragog fiercely. “We do not name it! I never
even told Hagrid the name of that dread creature, though he asked me, many
times.”
H ain
beyond imagining, pain past endurance —
He was gone from the hall, he was locked in the coils of a creature with red
eyes, so tightly bound that Harry did not know where his body ended and the
creature’s began. They were fused together, bound by pain, and there was no
escape —
And when the creature spoke, it used Harry’s mouth, so that in his agony he
felt his jaw move. . . .
“Kill me now, Dumbledore . . .”
Blinded and dying, every part of him screaming for release, Harry felt the
creature use him again gh’ nice of him, that is, an’ not turnin’ yeh in either. I’ve never really
had a lot ter do with Horace Slughorn before. . . . Comin’ ter see old Aragog

Harry thought privately that what Aragog would have liked most about
Slughorn was the ample amount of edible flesh he provided, but he merely
moved to the rear window of Hagrid’s hut, where he saw the rather horrible
sight of the enormous dead spider lying on its back outside, its legs cur 
“But then . . . Do you know what 
did
 kill that girl?” said Harry. “Because
whatever it is, it’s back and attacking people again —”
His words were drowned by a loud outbreak of clicking and the rustling of
many long legs shifting angrily; large black shapes shifted all around him.
“The thing that lives in the castle,” said Aragog, “is an ancient creature we
spiders fear above all others. Well do I remember how I pleaded with Hagrid
to let me go, when I sensed the beast moving about the school.”
“What is i arry didn’t want to press the subject, not with the spiders pressing closer

his domed web, but his fellow spiders continued to inch slowly toward Harry

“We’ll just go, then,” Harry called desperately to Aragog, hearing leaves
rustling behind him.
“Go?” said Aragog slowly. “I think not. . . .”
“But — but —”
“My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid, on my command. But I
cannot deny them fresh meat, when it wanders so will t?” said Harry urgently.
More loud clicking, more rustling; the spiders seemed to be closing in.
“We do not speak of it!” said Aragog fiercely. “We do not name it! I never

“Is it Hagrid?” said Aragog, moving closer, his eight milky eyes wandering
vaguely.
“Strangers,” clicked the spider who had brought Ron.

Who does Harry marry?,Ginny Weasley,"According to the context, Harry is going to marry Ginny Weasley.","at he really is going to marry

beside the open window of the Gryffindor common room, looking out over
the twilit grounds.
“She’s not that bad,” said Harry. “Ugly, though,” he added hastily, as Ginny
raised her eyebrows, and she let out a reluctant giggle.
“Well, I suppose if Mum can stand it, I can.”
“Anyone else we know died?” Ron asked Hermione, who was perusing the
Evening Prophet.
Hermione winced at the forced toughness in his v did not quite see how it happened, both women were
crying and hugging each other. Completely bewildered, wondering whether
the world had gone mad, he turned around: Ron looked as stunned as he felt
and Ginny and Hermione were exchanging startled looks.
“You see!” said a strained voice. Tonks was glaring at Lupin. “She still
wants to marry him, even though he’s been bitten! She doesn’t care!”
“It’s different,” said Lupin, barely moving his lips and looking suddenly
tense. “Bill will not be a full werewolf. T at he now had a great
liking for very rare steaks.

Bill’s pillows, “because ze British overcook their meat, I ’ave always said

fast as they could. Hermione looked after them curiously, until the man with

had been pinned upon the Room of Requirement’s wall and handed it to
Fudge.
“The moment I saw Potter’s name on the list, I knew what we were dealing
with,” she said softly.

“Yeah, but that’s another thing, how did they get premises?” said Ron,
hitting his teacup so hard with his wand that its legs collapsed again and it lay
twitching before him. “It’s a bit dodgy, isn’t it? They’ll need loads of

what they’ve been up to, to get their hands on that sort of gold . . .”
“Well, yes, that occurre

“Your mum said the shop’s going well,” said Harry. “Said Fred and George

“That’s an understatement,” said Ron. “They’re raking in the Galleons! I
can’t wait to see the place, we haven’t been to Diagon Alley yet, because
Mum says Dad’s got to be there for extra security and he’s been really busy at
work, but it sounds excellent.”
“And what about Percy?” asked Harry; the third-eldest Weasley brother had
fallen out with the  eon.
“In Diagon Alley,” said Dumbledore. “I have your list of books and schoolequipment with me. I can help you find everything —”
“You’re coming with me?” asked Riddle, looking up.
“Certainly, if you —”
“I don’t need you,” said Riddle. “I’m used to doing things for myself, I go

Harry thought that Dumbledore would insist upon accompanying Riddle,
but once again he was surprised. Dumbledore h , or Hermione
Granger this time.
Three boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle one at once: It was
the pale boy from Madam Malkin’s robe shop. He was looking at Harry with
a lot more interest than he’d shown back in Diagon Alley.
“Is it true?” he said. “They’re saying all down the train that Harry Potter’s
in this compartment. So it’s you, is it?”
“Yes,” said Harry. He was looking at the other boys. Both of them were
thickset and looked extremely mean. Standing on either side of the pale boy,

The sooner he got out of here, the better. Nose still stinging where it had hit
the hearth, Harry made his way swiftly and silently toward the door, but
before he’d got halfway toward it, two people appeared on the other side of
the glass — and one of them was the very last person Harry wanted to meet
when he was lost, covered in soot, and wearing broken glasses: Draco Malfoy.
Harry looked quickly around and spotted a large bla cribing famous games he’d been to with his
brothers and the broomstick he’d like to get if he had the money. He was just
taking Harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door
slid open yet again, but it wasn’t Neville the toadless boy, or Hermione

“How did you — ?”
“Harry, please. You’re talking to the man who raised Fred and George.”

“Yeah . . . I — er . . . thanks,” said Harry weakly.
“What is this thing?” said Moody, drawing the Marauder’s Map out of his
pocket and unfolding it.
“Map of Hogwarts,” said Harry, hoping Moody was going to pull him out
of the staircase soon; his leg was really hurting him.
“Merlin’s beard,” Moody whispered, staring at the map, his magical eye
going haywire. “This . . . this is some map, Potter!”
“Yeah, it’s . . . quite useful,” Harry said. His eyes were starting to water
from the pain. “Er — Professor   So I waited and watched. I used the map I had taken from Harry

where, sunk in the step to above his knee, he couldn’t reach it.

open, and began wailing loudly in the corridor below. Harry pulled out hiswand and struggled to touch the Marauder’s Map, to wipe it blank, but it was

Harry felt sick; his heart was hammering very fast —
“PEEVES!” Filch roared gleefully. “You’ve been stealing!”
He ripped back the tapestry below, and Harry saw his horrible, pouchy face
and bulging, pale eyes st rry, setting off, bent-backed, after Crookshanks.“Where does this tunnel come out?” Hermione asked breathlessly from
behind him.
“I don’t know. . . . It’s marked on the Marauder’s Map but Fred and George

toward the remainder of the Beauxbatons party. “Disappointed” was a bit of

Dear Sirius,
You told me to keep you posted on what’s happening at Hogwarts,
so here goes — 
I don’t know if you’ve heard, but the Triwizard
Tournament’s happening this year and on Saturday night I got
picked as a fourth champion. I don’t know who put my name in the
Goblet of Fire, because I didn’t. The other Hogwarts champion is
Cedric Diggory, from Hufflepuff.
He paused at this point, thinking. He had an urge to say something about
the large weight of anxiety that seemed to have settled inside his chest ance of the sign in the entrance hall had a marked effect upon
the inhabitants of the castle. During the following week, there seemed to be
only one topic of conversation, no matter where Harry went: the Triwizard
Tournament. Rumors were flying from student to student like highly
contagious germs: who was going to try for Hogwarts champion, what the
tournament would involve, how the students from Beauxbatons and
Durmstrang differed from themselves.
Harry noticed too that the castle seemed to be undergoing a said Ron.
“Oh . . .” The girl who had spoken turned her back on him, and as they
walked on they distinctly heard her say, “’Ogwarts.”
“Beauxbatons,” muttered Hermione.
“Sorry?” said Harry.
“They must go to Beauxbatons,” said Hermione. “You know . . .

An Appraisal of
Magical Education in Europe.

“Oh . . . yeah . . . right,” said Harry.
“Fred and George can’t have gone that far,” said Ron, pulling out his wand,
lighting it like Hermione’s, and squinting dn’t reach
her wand? Harry took the right fork with a feeling of increasing unease . . .
but at the same time, he couldn’t help thinking, 
One champion down . . .
The Cup was somewhere close by, and it sounded as though Fleur was no
longer in the running. He’d got this far, hadn’t he? What if he actually
managed to win? Fleetingly, and for the first time since he’d found himself
champion, he saw again that image of himself, raising the Triwizard Cup in

another attempt. We have worked hard over the summer to ensure that this

will take place at Halloween. An impartial judge will decide which students

Predictably, Malfoy arrived at Hagrid’s cabin with his familiar sneer firmly
in place.

“Stop saying the name!” said Ron in a terrified whisper, as if he thought

Harry wasn’t listening.

“Will you stop saying the name!”
 Ron hissed.
“So all I’ve  gain.
“Well,” said Lupin, frowning slightly, “I assumed that if the boggart faced
you, it would assume the shape of Lord Voldemort.”
Harry stared. Not only was this the last answer he’d expected, but Lupin
had said Voldemort’s name. The only person Harry had ever heard say the
name aloud (apart from himself) was Professor Dumbledore.
“Clearly, I was wrong,” said Lupin, still frowning at Harry. “But I didn’t

There was a little silence. Lily had picked up a fallen twig and twirled it in
the air, and Harry knew that she was imagining sparks trailing from it. Then
she dropped the twig, leaned in toward the boy, and said, “It 
is
 real, isn’t it?
It’s not a joke? Petunia says you’re lying to me. Petunia says there isn’t a

“It’s real for us,” said Snape. “Not for her. But we’ll get the letter, you and
me.”
“Really?” whispered Lily.
“Definitely,” said Snape, and even with his poorly cut hair and his odd
clothes, he struck an oddly impressive figure sprawled in front of her, brimful
of confidence in his destiny.
“And will it really come by owl?” Lily whispered.
“Normally,” s name, everyone in our world knows —”
“Who?”
“Well — I don’ like sayin’ the name if I can help it. No one does.”
“Why not?”
“Gulpin’ gargoyles, Harry, people are still scared. Blimey, this is difficult.
See, there was this wizard who went . . . bad. As bad as you could go. Worse.
Worse than worse. His name was . . .”
Hagrid gulped, but no words came out.
“Could you write it down?” Harry suggested.
“Nah — can’t spell it. All right — 
Voldemort.
” Hagrid shuddered. “Don’
make me say it again. Anyway, this —  h the picture
belonged; it was a rather dull story about interschool competitions.
“Her name was Eileen Prince. 
Prince,
 Harry.”
They looked at each other, and Harry realized what Hermione was trying to
say. He burst out laughing.
“No way.”
“What?”
“You think 
she
 was the Half-Blood . . . ? Oh, come on.”
“Well, why not? Harry, there aren’t any real princes in the Wizarding
world! It’s either a nickname, a made-up title somebody’s given themselves,
or it could be their actual name, couldn’t it? No, listen!"

You mean that you did magic without meaning to; you reacted instinctively.”
“No,” said Harry. “The bike was falling, I couldn’t have told you where
Voldemort was, but my wand spun in my hand and found him and shot a spell
at him, and it wasn’t even a spell I recognized. I’ve never made gold flames
appear before.”
“Often,” said Mr. Weasley, “when you’re in a pressured situation you can
produce magic you never dreamed of. Small children often find, before
they’re trai a spell

appear before.”
“Often,” said Mr. Weasley, “when you’re in a pressured situation you can
produce magic you never dreamed of. Small children often find, before
they’re trained —”
“It wasn’t like that,” said Harry through gritted teeth. His scar was burning:
He felt angry and frustrated; he hated the idea that they were all imagining
him to have power to match Voldemort’s.
No one said anything. He knew that they did not belie of Umbridge, who was
watching coolly from near the doors into the entrance hall.
“Oh bravo!” cried Professor Tofty, who was examining Harry again, whenHarry demonstrated a perfect boggart banishing spell. “Very good indeed!
Well, I think that’s all, Potter . . . unless . . .”
He leaned forward a little.
“I heard, from my dear friend Tiberius Ogden, that you can produce a
Patronus? For a bonus point . . . ?”
Harry raised his wand, looked directly at Umbridge, and imagined her
being sacked.
“Expecto Patronum! lt a creeping chill behind him that could mean only
one thing. There was more than one.
“DUDLEY, KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT! WHATEVER YOU DO,
KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT! Wand!” Harry muttered frantically, his hands
flying over the ground like spiders. “Where’s — wand — come on —
Lumos!

He said the spell automatically, desperate for light to help him in his search
— and to his disbelieving relief, light flared inches from his right hand — the
wand-tip had ignited. Harry snatched it up, scrambled to his feet, and turne ed, 
“Stupefy!”
The great blond Death Eater was hit in the face by a jet of red light: He
slumped sideways, unconscious. His companion, unable to see who had cast
the spell, fired another at Ron: Shining black ropes flew from his wand-tip
and bound Ron head to foot — the waitress screamed and ran for the door —
Harry sent another Stunning Spell at the Death Eater with the twisted face
who had tied up Ron, but the spell missed, rebounded on the window, and hit
the waitress, who collapsed in front of the door or.
“Let’s not stay long,” Ron said quietly.
The Healer pointed her wand at the door of the Janus Thickey ward and
muttered 
“Alohomora.” 
The door swung open and she led the way inside,
keeping a firm grasp on Gilderoy’s arm until she had settled him into an
armchair beside his bed.
“This is our long-term resident ward,” she informed Harry, Ron, Hermione,
and Ginny in a low voice. “For permanent spell damage, you know. Of
course, with intensive remedial potions and charms and a bit of luck, we can
produce  — come on —
Lumos!
”
He said the spell automatically, desperate for light to help him in his search
— and to his disbelieving relief, light flared inches from his right hand — the
wand-tip had ignited. Harry snatched it up, scrambled to his feet, and turned
around.
His stomach turned over.
A towering, hooded figure was gliding smoothly toward him, hovering over
the ground, no feet or face visible beneath its robes, sucking on the night as it
came.Stumbling backward, Harry raised his wand.
“Expecto Patronum! y no hand but his —”
“— an’ dementors won’t kill him! The Dark Lord wants Potter’s life, not
his soul. He’ll be easier to kill if he’s been Kissed first!”
There were noises of agreement. Dread filled Harry: To repel dementors
they would have to produce Patronuses, which would give them away
immediately.
“We’re going to have to try to Disapparate, Harry!” Hermione whispered.
Even as she said it, he felt the unnatural cold begin to steal over the street.

backed out of number four’s drive.
It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something
peculiar — a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn’t realize what
he had seen — then he jerked his head around to look again. There was a
tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn’t a map in

Attracted no doubt by Malfoy’s shout, Argus Filch came
shouldering his way through the crowd. Then he saw Mrs. Norris and fell
back, clutching his face in horror.
“My cat! My cat! What’s happened to Mrs. Norris?” he shrieked.
And drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on
the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a
statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didn’t
so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two
owls swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved

at all.
A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so
suddenly and silently you’d have thought he’d just popped out of the ground.
The cat’s tail twitched and its eyes narrowed.Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was tall, thin,
and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both
long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long rob rs of his name rearranged

“You see?” he whispered. “It was a name I was already using at Hogwarts,
to my most intimate friends only, of course. You think I was going to use my
filthy Muggle father’s name forever? I, in whose veins runs the blood of
Salazar Slytherin himself, through my mother’s side? I, keep the name of a
foul, common Muggle, who abandoned me even before I was born, just
because he found out his wife was a witch? No, Harry — I fashioned myself a

Attracted no doubt by Malfoy’s shout, Argus Filch came

And his popping eyes fell on Harry.
“You!”
 he screeched. “
You!
 You’ve murdered my cat! You’ve killed her!
I’ll kill you! I’ll —”
“Argus!”
Dumbledore had arrived on the scene, followed by a number of other
teachers. In seconds, he had swept past Harry, Ron,  his head around to look again. There was a
tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn’t a map in
sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the
light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley
drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It
was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive — no, 
looking
 at the sign;
cats couldn’t read maps 
or
 signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and lbus Dumbledore.
Albus Dumbledore didn’t seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street
where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He was busy
rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But he did seem to realize he
was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still
staring at him from the other end of the street. For some reason, the sight of
the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and muttered, “I should have
known.”
He found what he was looking for in "
What magical plant does Harry use to breathe underwater in the Triwizard Tournament?,Gillyweed,Harry uses the Gillywater plant to breathe underwater in the Triwizard Tournament.,"without their noticing.
Hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on
her. Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off
them, but the more they strained against it, the tighter and faster the plant
wound around them.
“Stop moving!” Hermione ordered them. “I know what this is — it’s
Devil’s Snare!”
“Oh, I’m so glad we know what it’s called, that’s a great help,” snarled
Ron, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck.
“Shut up, I’m h!”
She leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. She had to struggle
because the moment she had landed, the plant had started to twist snakelike
tendrils around her ankles. As for Harry and Ron, their legs had already been
bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing.

Harry stared around the bathroom, thinking . . . if the voices could only be

“Er,” said Harry, yet again.
“Do you think that the trauma in your past might have made you keen to

tempted to enter the Triwizard Tournament because —”
“I didn’t enter,”
 said Harry, starting to feel irritated.
“Can you remember your parents at all?” said Rita Skeeter, talking over
him.
“No,” said Harry.
“How do you think they’d feel if they knew you were competing in the

“He’d want you to tell him,”
 said Hermione sternly. “He’s going to find out
anyway —”
“How?”
“Harry, this isn’t going to be kept quiet,” said Hermione, very seriously.

“You has to eat this, sir!” squeaked the elf, and he put his hand in the

green rat tails. “Right before you go into the lake, sir — gillyweed!”

“Hagrid, he killed . . .”
“Killed?” said Hagrid loudly, staring down at Harry. “Snape killed?

“Dumbledore,” said Harry. “Snape killed . . . Dumbledore.”
Hagrid simply looked at him, the little of his face that could be seen
completely blank, uncomprehending.
“Dumbledore wha’, Harry?”
“He’s dead. Snape killed him. . . .”
“Don’ say that,” said Hagrid roughly. “Snape kill Dumbledore — don’ be

“He is simply Stunned, Winky,” said Dumbledore. “Step aside, please.
Severus, you have the potion?”
Snape handed Dumbledore a small glass bottle of completely clear liquid:
the Veritaserum with which he had threatened Harry in class. Dumbledore got
up, bent over the man on the floor, and pulled him into a sitting position
against the wall beneath the Foe-Glass, in which the reflections of
Dumbledore, Snape, and McGonagall were still glaring down upon them all.
Win on the floor.
Filthy, disheveled, Winky peered around Snape’s legs. Her mouth opened
wide and she let out a piercing shriek.
“Master Barty, Master Barty, what is you doing here?”She flung herself forward onto the young man’s chest.
“You is killed him! You is killed him! You is killed Master’s son!”
“He is simply Stunned, Winky,” said Dumbledore. “Step aside, please.

“Noooo!”

“You killed your father,” Dumbledore said, in the same soft voice. “Whatdid you do with the body?”
“Carried it into the forest. Covered it with the Invisibility Cloak. I had the
map with me. I watched Potter run into the castle. He met Snape. Dumbledore
joined them. I watched Potter bringing Dumbledore out of the castle. I wal several deaths!”
“But he cannot now give testimony, Cornelius,” said Dumbledore. He was
staring hard at Fudge, as though seeing him plainly for the first time. “He
cannot give evidence about why he killed those people.”
“Why he killed them? Well, that’s no mystery, is it?” blustered Fudge. “He
was a raving lunatic! From what Minerva and Severus have told me, he seems
to have thought he was doing it all on You-Know-Who’s instructions!”
“Lord Voldemort 
was

WANTED FOR QUESTIONING ABOUT THE DEATH OF ALBUS
DUMBLEDORE
Ron and Hermione gave roars of outrage, but Harry said nothing. He
pushed the newspaper away; he did not want to read any more: He knew what
it would say. Nobody but those who had been on top of the tower when
Dumbledore died knew who had really killed him and, as Rita Skeeter had
already told the Wizarding world, Harry had been seen running from the place
moments after Dumbledore had fallen.
“I’m sorry, Harry,” f Tom Riddle for a very long time.“Now,” said Dumbledore, “if you don’t mind, Harry, I want to pause once
more to draw your attention to certain points of our story. Voldemort had
committed another murder; whether it was his first since he killed the Riddles,
I do not know, but I think it was. This time, as you will have seen, he killed
not for revenge, but for gain. He wanted the two fabulous trophies that poor,
besotted, old woman showed him. Just as he had once robbed the other
children at his orphanage,"

“So, the first question we must ask ourselves is, what 
is

Hermione put up her hand.
“It’s a shape-shifter,” she said. “It can take the shape of whatever it thinks
will frighten us most.”
“Couldn’t have put it better myself,” said Professor Lupin, and Hermioneglowed. “So the boggart sitting in the darkness within has not yet assumed a

when Lord Voldemort is near you, and when he is feeling a particularly strong

“But . . . why?”
“Because you and he are connected by the curse that failed,” said
Dumbledore. “That is no ordinary scar.”
“So you think . . . that dream . . . did it really happen?”
“It is possible,” said Dumbledore. “I would say — probable. Harry — did

“No,” said Harry. “Just the back of his chair. But — there wouldn’t have

Harry shook his head and covered his eyes with his hands, pressing down
upon them with his palms. Little stars erupted in them. He felt Ron sit down
on the bench beside him and knew Ron was staring at him.
“Is this what it was about last time?” said Ron in a hushed voice. “When
your scar hurt in Umbridge’s office? You-Know-Who was angry?”
Harry shook his head.
“What is it, then?”
Harry was thinking himself back. He had been looking into Umbridge’s
face. . . . His scar had hurt . . .   with brilliant green eyes and jet-black hair that was
always untidy. He wore round glasses, and on his forehead was a thin,
lightning-shaped scar.
It was this scar that made Harry so particularly unusual, even for a wizard.
This scar was the only hint of Harry’s very mysterious past, of the reason he
had been left on the Dursleys’ doorstep eleven years before.
At the age of one year old, Harry had somehow survived a curse from the
greatest Dark sorcerer of all time, Lord Voldemort, whose name most witches
 th behind him told him they were
Hermione’s.
“What?” she whispered.
“Dumbledore never told you that the reason you bear that scar was hidden
in the bowels of the Department of Mysteries?” said Malfoy sneeringly.
“I — what?” said Harry, and for a moment he quite forgot his plan. “What
about my scar?”
“What?” 
whispered Hermione more urgently behind him.
“Can this be?” said Malfoy, sounding maliciously delighted; some of the
Death Eaters were laughing again, and under cover of their laughter, Harry
hissed to "

Ron made a sudden movement: Harry reacted, but before either wand was
clear of its owner’s pocket, Hermione had raised her own.
“Protego!”
 she cried, and an invis with me. Her parents have forbidden her to do anything that
might upset Umbridge, you see — her mum works for the Ministry.”
“What about your parents?” asked Harry.
“Well, they’ve forbidden me to get on the wrong side of Umbridge too,”
said Cho, drawing herself up proudly. “But if they think I’m not going to fight
You-Know-Who after what happened to Cedric —”
She broke off, looking rather confused, and an awkward silence fell
between them; Terry Boot’s wand went whizzing past Harry’s ear and hit
Alicia Spin ut with a
noise of contempt he turned on his heel, vaulted into bed, and pulled the
hangings shut with such violence that they were ripped from the bed and fell
in a dusty pile to the floor. Ron glared at Seamus, then looked at Dean and
Neville.
“Anyone else’s parents got a problem with Harry?” he said aggressively.
“My parents are Muggles, mate,” said Dean, shrugging. “They don’t know
nothing about no deaths at Hogwarts, because I’m not stupid enough to tell
them.”
“You don’t know my mother, she’ll weasel  ape
him not once, but four times so far — something that neither your parents, nor
Neville’s parents, ever achieved.”
“Why did he do it, then?” said Harry, who felt numb and cold. “Why did he
try and kill me as a baby? He should have waited to see whether Neville or I
looked more dangerous when we were older and tried to kill whoever it was
then —”
“That might, indeed, have been the more practical course,” said
Dumbledore, “except that Voldemort’s information about the prophecy was

Dudley’s hands jerked upward to cover his mouth. With his parents’ and
Harry’s eyes upon him, he slowly lowered them again and asked, “There
are . . . more of them?”
“More?” laughed Harry. “More than the two that attacked us, you mean?
Of course there are, there are hundreds, maybe thousands by this time, seeing
as they feed off fear and despair —”
“All right, all right,” blustered Vernon Dursley. “You’ve made your point

“I hope so,” said Harry, “because once I’m seventeen, all of them — Dea ” could hear the name of the most evil wizard of all time without the
slightest tremor.
“Lord — hang on,” said Uncle Vernon, his face screwed up, a look of
dawning comprehension in his piggy eyes. “I’ve heard that name . . . that was
the one who . . .”
“Murdered my parents, yes,” Harry said.
“But he’s gone,” said Uncle Vernon impatiently, without the slightest signthat the murder of Harry’s parents might be a painful topic to anybody. “That
giant bloke said so. He’s gone.”
“He’s back,” said Harry heavily.

This last part was not true; in fact, Harry had seen his father use the spell

excursion into the Pensieve. Now, however, a wonderful possibility occurred
to him. Could the Half-Blood Prince possibly be — ?
“Maybe your dad did use it, Harry,” said Hermione, “but he’s not the only
one. We’ve seen a whole bunch of people use me with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to
jump. Then there were doors that wouldn’t open unless you asked politely, or
tickled them in exactly the right place, and doors that weren’t really doors at
all, but solid walls just pretending. It was also very hard to remember where
anything was, because it all seemed to move around a lot. The people in the
portraits kept going to visit each other, and Harry was sure the coats of armor
could walk.The ghosts didn’t help, either. It was always   making a note of something that had been used against him!”
“I don’t believe this,” said Hermione. “You’re actually defending —”
“I’m not defending what I did!” said Harry quickly. “I wish I hadn’t done
it, and not just because I’ve got about a dozen detentions. You know I
wouldn’t’ve used a spell like that, not even on Malfoy, but you can’t blame

making notes for himself, wasn’t he, not for anyone else. . . .”

homemade mince pies.
Har staring. Harry wished they
wouldn’t, because he was trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes.
There were a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts: wide,
sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere different on a
Friday; some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to
jump. Then there were doors that wouldn’t open unless you asked politely, or
tickled them in exactly the right place, and doors that weren’t really doors at
all, but solid walls just pretendin mione were on their feet, all three of them having used a
different hex. Nor were they the only ones to have done so.
“Thought we’d see what those three were up to,” said Fred matter-of-factly,
stepping onto Goyle and into the compartment. He had his wand out, and so
did George, who was careful to tread on Malfoy as he followed Fred inside.
“Interesting effect,” said George, looking down at Crabbe. “Who used the
Furnunculus Curse?”
“Me,” said Harry.
“Odd,” said George lightly. “I used Jelly-Legs. Looks as t"

Ron gave an involuntary shudder.
“Years back, there were a lot of witches and wizards being controlled by
the Imperius Curse,” said Moody, and Harry knew he was talking about the
days in which Voldemort had been all-powerful. “Some job for the Ministry,
trying to sort out who was being forced to act, and who was acting of their
own free will.
“The Imperius Curse can be fought, and I’ll be teaching you how, but it
takes real strength of character, and not everyone’s got it. Better a the Imperius Curse lift. Once he’d got his
voice back, he’d explain what he’d been doing, wouldn’t he? They would
have known he’d been sent to steal the weapon. Of course, it would have been
easy for Lucius Malfoy to put the curse on him. Never out of the Ministry, is
he?”
“He was even hanging around that day I had my hearing,” said Harry. “In
the — hang on . . .” he said slowly. “He was in the Department of Mysteries
corridor that day! Your dad said he was probably trying to sneak down and
find out what ha  a raid on his
Clapham home . . .’”
“Stan Shunpike, a Death Eater?” said Harry, remembering the spotty youth
he had first met three years before. “No way!”
“He might have been put under the Imperius Curse,” said Ron reasonably.
“You never can tell.”
“It doesn’t look like it,” said Hermione, who was still reading. “It says here
he was arrested after he was overheard talking about the Death Eaters’ secret
plans in a pub.” She looked up with a troubled expression on her face. “If he
was under the Imperius Curs  to be able to help you with
this, Harry!” said Hermione, more loudly. “There’s only one way to force
someone to do what you want, and that’s the Imperius Curse, which is illegal
—”
“Yeah, I know that, thanks,” said Harry, not looking up from the book.
“That’s why I’m looking for something different. Dumbledore says
Veritaserum won’t do it, but there might be something else, a potion or a
spell. . . .”
“You’re going about it the wrong way,” said Hermione. “Only you can get

Mungo’s, his brain had gone all funny and he couldn’t talk. But remember
what the Healer told us? He was recovering. And they couldn’t risk him
getting better, could they? I mean, the shock of whatever happened when he
touched that weapon probably made the Imperius Curse lift. Once he’d got his
voice back, he’d explain what he’d been doing, wouldn’t he? They would
have known he’d been sent to steal the weapon. Of course, it would have been
easy for Lucius Malfoy to put the curse on him. Never out of the  ate step. He
had had much more difficulty with the curse than Harry, though Moodyassured him the effects would wear off by lunchtime. “Talk about
paranoid . . .” Ron glanced nervously over his shoulder to check that Moody
was definitely out of earshot and went on. “No wonder they were glad to get
shot of him at the Ministry. Did you hear him telling Seamus what he did to
that witch who shouted ‘Boo’ behind him on April Fools’ Day? And when are
we supposed to read up on resisting the Imperius Curse with ever an you should have in that maze tonight, of
course,” said Moody. “I was patrolling around it, able to see through the outer
hedges, able to curse many obstacles out of your way. I Stunned Fleur
Delacour as she passed. I put the Imperius Curse on Krum, so that he would
finish Diggory and leave your path to the Cup clear.”
Harry stared at Moody. He just didn’t see how this could be. . . .

Death Eaters . . . It made no sense . . . no se he, he’s got his own body, he wouldn’t
need to share someone else’s. He could have her under the Imperius Curse, I
suppose . . .”
Harry watched Fred, George, and Lee Jordan juggling empty butterbeerbottles for a moment. Then Hermione said, “But last year your scar hurt when
nobody was touching you, and didn’t Dumbledore say it had to do with what
You-Know-Who was feeling at the time? I mean, maybe this hasn’t got

who was trying to read it upside down.
Harry looked at his watch and hurriedly put the old copy of 
Advanced
Potion-Making
 back into his bag.
“It’s five to eight, I’d better go, I’ll be late for Dumbledore.”
“Ooooh!” gasped Hermione, looking up at once. “Good luck! We’ll wait
up, we want to hear what he teaches you!”
“Hope it goes okay,” said Ron, and the pair of them watched Harry leave
through the portrait hole.
Harry proceeded through rts, except now it’s just the Dark Arts. We’re supposed to practice the
Cruciatus Curse on people who’ve earned detentions —”
“What?”
Harry, Ron, and Hermione’s united voices echoed up and down the
passage.
“Yeah,” said Neville. “That’s how I got this one,” he pointed at a
particularly deep gash in his cheek, “I refused to do it. Some people are into
it, though; Crabbe and Goyle love it. First time they’ve ever been top in
anything, I expect.
“Alecto, Amycus’s sister, teaches Muggle Studies, which is compul very important!” said Hermione, shocked.
“Not the way Lockhart teaches it,” said Ron. “I haven’t learned anything
from him except not to set pixies loose.”
Neville Longbottom had been sent letters from all the witches and wizards
in his family, all giving him different advice on what to choose. Confused and
worried, he sat reading the subject lists with his tongue poking out, asking
people whether they thought Arithmancy sounded more difficult than Study
of Ancient Runes. Dean Thomas, who, like Harry, had g  later looking slightly crestfallen.
“So, Potter, Potter . . .” said Professor McGonagall, consulting her notes as
she turned to Harry. “Charms, Defense Against the Dark Arts, Herbology,
Transfiguration . . . all fine. I must say, I was pleased with your
Transfiguration mark, Potter, very pleased. Now, why haven’t you applied to
continue with Potions? I thought it was your ambition to become an Auror?”
“It was, but you told me I had to get an ‘Outstanding’ in my O.W.L.,
Professor.”
“And so you did when Prof e. The other teachers are all supposed to refer
us to the Carrows if we do anything wrong. They don’t, though, if they can
avoid it. You can tell they all hate them as much as we do.
“Amycus, the bloke, he teaches what used to be Defense Against the Dark
Arts, except now it’s just the Dark Arts. We’re supposed to practice the
Cruciatus Curse on people who’ve earned detentions —”
“What?”
Harry, Ron, and Hermione’s united voices echoed up and down the
passage.
“Yeah,” said Neville. “That’s how I got this one, Percy.
“N-nothing.”
The pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder to shake off was the
feeling Harry had gotten from the teacher’s look — a feeling that he didn’t
like Harry at all.
“Who’s that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?” he asked Percy.
“Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder he’s looking so
nervous, that’s Professor Snape. He teaches Potions, but he doesn’t want to —
everyone knows he’s after Quirrell’s job. Knows an awful lot about the Dark
Arts, Snape.”
Harry watched Snape fo ut will be delighted to see you
back with an ‘Outstanding’ O.W.L. And you qualify for Defense Against the
Dark Arts with ‘Exceeds Expectations.’ But the problem is Transfiguration.
I’m sorry, Longbottom, but an ‘Acceptable’ really isn’t good enough to
continue to N.E.W.T. level. I just don’t think you’d be able to cope with the
coursework.”
Neville hung his head. Professor McGonagall peered at him through her
square spectacles.
“Why do you want to continue with Transfiguration, anyway? I’ve never
had the im  rounded off the lesson by setting them their largest amount of Charmshomework ever.
It was the same, if not worse, in Transfiguration.
“You cannot pass an O.W.L.,” said Professor McGonagall grimly, “without
serious application, practice, and study. I see no reason why everybody in this
class should not achieve an O.W.L. in Transfiguration as long as they put in
the work.” Neville made a sad little disbelieving noise. “Yes, you too,

“Yeah, that is weird,” said Harry, frowning. “I heard him telling Crabbe it
wasn’t Crabbe’s business what he was doing . . . so what’s he telling all
these . . . all these . . .”
Harry’s voice tailed away; he was staring at the fire.
“God, I’ve been stupid,” he said quietly. “It’s obvious, isn’t it? There was a
great vat of it down in the dungeon. . . . He could’ve nicked some any time
during that lesson. . . .”
“Nicked what?” said Ron.

Winky was shaking her head, trembling.

trouble!”

Dumbledore looked down on the Moody in the trunk. “The imposter has been
cutting it off all year, see where it is uneven? But I think, in w did you escape from Azkaban?”
Crouch took a deep, shuddering breath, then began to speak in a flat,
expressionless voice.
“My mother saved me. She knew she was dying. She persuaded my father
to rescue me as a last favor to her. He loved her as he had never loved me. He

Winky was shaking her hea that
Malfoy was staying, which struck them as very suspicious. The holidays
would be the perfect time to use the Polyjuice Potion and try to worm a
confession out of him.
Unfortunately, the potion was only half finished. They still needed the
bicorn horn and the boomslang skin, and the only place they were going to get
them was from Snape’s private stores. Harry privately felt he’d rather face
Slytherin’s legendary monster than let Snape catch him robbing his office.
“What we need,” said Hermione briskly as  a month or so, you feel like explaining, you will let us know, won’t
you?” said Ron irritably.
“All right,” said Hermione coldly. “What we’d need to do is to get inside
the Slytherin common room and ask Malfoy a few questions without him
realizing it’s us.”
“But that’s impossible,” Harry said as Ron laughed.
“No, it’s not,” said Hermione. “All we’d need would be some Polyjuice
Potion.”
“What’s that?” said Ron and Harry together.
“Snape mentioned it in class a few weeks ago —”
“D’you think we’ve got nothing at her.
“It’s Veritaserum, a colorless, odorless potion that forces the drinker to tell
the truth,” said Hermione.
“Very good, very good!” said Slughorn happily. “Now,” he continued,
pointing at the cauldron nearest the Ravenclaw table, “this one here is pretty
well known. . . . Featured in a few Ministry leaflets lately too . . . Who can —
?”
Hermione’s hand was fastest once more.
“It’s Polyjuice Potion, sir,” she said.
Harry too had recognized the slow-bubbling, mudlike substance in the
second cauldron, b"

the snake hiding somewhere? Did it just come out and kill her and attackyou?”
“No,” he said. “
She
 was the snake . . . or the snake was her . . . all along.”
“W-what?”
He closed his eyes. He could still smell Bathilda’s house on him: It made
the whole thing horribly vivid.
“Bathilda must’ve been dead a while. The snake was . . . was inside her.
You-Know-Who put it there in Godric’s Hollow, to wait. You were right. He
knew I’d go back.”
“The snake was
 inside 
her?”
He opened hi ot know how I got there.”
Harry hardly dared believe her, yet his heart was lightening almost in spite
of himself.
“That dream I had about your dad and the snake, though —”
“Harry, you’ve had these dreams before,” Hermione said. “You had flashes
of what Voldemort was up to last year.”
“This was different,” said Harry, shaking his head. “I was inside that snake.
It was like I 
was
 the snake. . . . What if Voldemort somehow transported me
to London — ?”
“One day,” said Hermione, sounding thoroughly exasperat serpent, which relinquished its hold
upon Voldemort at once and turned, hissing furiously, to face Dumbledore.
Voldemort vanished. The snake reared from the floor, ready to strike —
There was a burst of flame in midair above Dumbledore just as Voldemort
reappeared, standing on the plinth in the middle of the pool where so recently
the five statues had stood.
“Look out!” 
Harry yelled.
But even as he shouted, one more jet of green light had flown at
Dumbledore from Voldemort’s wand and the snake had struck — stand her. Once
we were up in the room, the snake sent a message to You-Know-Who, I heard
it happen inside my head, I felt him get excited, he said to keep me there . . .

He remembered the snake coming out of Bathilda’s neck: Hermione did not
need to know the details.
“. . . she changed, changed into the snake, and attacked.”
He looked down at the puncture marks.
“It wasn’t supposed to kill me, just keep me there till You-Know-Who
came.”
If he had only managed to kill the snake, it would hav rs of his name rearranged
themselves:
I AM LORD VOLDEMORT
“You see?” he whispered. “It was a name I was already using at Hogwarts,
to my most intimate friends only, of course. You think I was going to use my
filthy Muggle father’s name forever? I, in whose veins runs the blood of
Salazar Slytherin himself, through my mother’s side? I, keep the name of a
foul, common Muggle, who abandoned me even before I was born, just
because he found out his wife was a witch? No, Harry — I fashioned myself a
new name, a n e getting
to the bottom of this business. He had moved forward in his chair so that,
without realizing it, he was perched on the very edge, tense as though poised
for flight.
“How come I saw through the snake’s eyes if it’s Voldemort’s thoughts I’m
sharing?”
“Do not say the Dark Lord’s name!” 
spat Snape.
There was a nasty silence. They glared at each other across the Pensieve.
“Professor Dumbledore says his name,” said Harry quietly.
“Dumbledore is an extremely powerful wizard,” Snape muttered. “While
he 
 t’s my fault, it’s all my fault,
Hermione, I’m sorry.”
“It’s not your fault. I wanted to go too; I really thought Dumbledore might
have left the sword there for you.”
“Yeah, well . . . we got that wrong, didn’t we?”
“What happened, Harry? What happened when she took you upstairs? Was
the snake hiding somewhere? Did it just come out and kill her and attackyou?”
“No,” he said. “
She
 was the snake . . . or the snake was her . . . all along.”
“W-what?”
He closed his eyes. He could still smell Bathilda’s house  hes and booms of the battle filled
the air, Harry hesitated. Voldemort wanted him to do this, wanted him to
come . . . Was he leading Ron and Hermione into a trap?
But then the reality seemed to close upon him, cruel and plain: The only
way forward was to kill the snake, and the snake was where Voldemort was,
and Voldemort was at the end of this tunnel. . . .
“Harry, we’re coming, just get in there!” said Ron, pushing him forward.
Harry wriggled into the earthy passage hidden in the tree’s roots. It was a

“And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor on the
right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very
painful death.”
Harry laughed, but he was one of the few who did.
“He’s not serious?” he mu voice, “I’ll see you at the feast. Have a good time.”
He accompanied them to the entrance hall, where Filch, the caretaker, was
standing inside the front doors, checking off names against a long list, peering
suspiciously into every face, and making sure that no one was sneaking out
who shouldn’t be going.
“Staying here, Potter?” shouted Malfoy, who was standing in line with
Crabbe and Goyle. “Scared of passing the dementors?”
Harry ignored him and made his solitary way up the marble staircase,
through the   excursion carefully, because he had been caught out of
bed and out-of-bounds by Filch the caretaker in the middle of the night once
before, and had no desire to repeat the experience. The Invisibility Cloak
would, of course, be essential, and as an added precaution, Harry thought he
would take the Marauder’s Map, which, next to the Cloak, was the most
useful aid to rule-breaking Harry owned. The map showed the whole of

What does the Mirror of Erised show?,The deepest desire of one's heart,"According to the text, the Mirror of Erised shows the deepest, most desperate desire of a person's heart.

“It — well — it shows me my family —”
“And it showed your friend Ron himself as Head Boy.”
“How did you know — ?”
“I don’t need a cloak to become invisible,” said Dumbledore gently. “Now,
can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?”
Harry shook his head.
“Let me explain. The happiest man on earth would be able to use the
Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it and see
himself exactly as he is. Does that help?”
Harry thought. Then he said slo  see that he was smiling.
“So,” said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with Harry,
“you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of
Erised.”
“I didn’t know it was called that, sir.”
“But I expect you’ve realized by now what it does?”
“It — well — it shows me my family —”

“How did you know — ?”
“I don’t need a cloak to become invisible,” said Dumbledore gently. “Now,

It was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell. It
was the Mirror of Erised.
“This mirror is the key to finding the Stone,” Quirrell murmured, tapping
his way around the frame. “Trust Dumbledore to come up with something like
this . . . but he’s in London . . . I’ll be far away by the time he gets back. . . .”
All Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and stop him
from concentrating on the mirror.
“I saw you and Sna e. He remembered seeing his dead parents in
the Mirror of Erised four years ago. He was going to be able to talk to Sirius
again, right now, he knew it —
He looked around to make sure there was nobody else there; the dormitory
was quite empty. He looked back at the mirror, raised it in front of his face
with trembling hands, and said, loudly and clearly, “Sirius.”
His breath misted the surface of the glass. He held the mirror even closer,
excitement flooding through him, but the eyes blinking back at him th  around looking for it, Snape, who already suspected me, went

It was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell. It

his way around the frame. “Tru is is a two-way mirror. I’ve got the other. If you need to speak to me,

Erised again, and for the rest of the Christmas holidays the Invisibility
Cloak stayed folded at the bottom of his trunk. Harry wished he could forget
what he’d seen in the mirror as easily, but he couldn’t. He started having
nightmares. Over and over again he dreamed about his parents disappearing

“Oh, I’m so glad we know what it’s called, that’s a great help,” snarled
Ron, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck.
“Shut up, I’m h!”
She leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. She had to struggle
because the moment she had landed, the plant had started to twist snakelike
tendrils around her ankles. As for Harry and Ron, their legs had already been
bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing.

The distant music stopped. There was a loud bark from the dog, but
Hermione had already jumped. She landed on Harry’s other side.

“Lucky!”

He sat up and felt around, his eyes not used to the gloom. It felt as though he
was sitting on some sort of plant.

She leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. She had to struggle
because the moment she had landed, the plant had started to twist snakelike
tendrils around her ankles. As for Harry and Ron, their legs had already been
bound tightly in long creepers  ppeared over the top of her upside-down

gave the plant a sharp prod with the tip of his quill.
Liquid squirted from every boil on the plant, thick, stinking, dark-green jets
of it; they hit the ceiling, the windows, and spattered Luna Lovegood’s
magazine. Ginny, who had flung her arms up in front of her face just in time,

“All righ’, Grawpy?” said Hagrid in a would-be cheery voice, backing
away with the long bough raised, ready to poke Grawp again. “Had a nice
sleep, eh?”
Harry and Hermione retreated as far as they could while still keeping the
giant within their sights. Grawp knelt between two trees he had not yet
uprooted. They looked up into his startlingly huge face, which resembled a
gray full moon swimming in the gloom of the clearing. It was as"

The giant chuckled darkly.
“Yer great puddin’ of a son don’ need fattenin’ anymore, Dursley, don’

He passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry he had never tasted
anything so wonderful, but he still couldn’t take his eyes off the giant. Finally,
as nobody seemed about to explain anything, he said, “I’m sorry, but I still
don’t really know who you are.”
The giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand.

were under seventeen from entering the tournament.
“Who’s this impartial judge who’s going to decide who the champions
are?” said Harry.
“Dunno,” said Fred, “but it’s them we’ll have to fool. I reckon a couple of
drops of Aging Potion might do it, George. . . .”
“Dumbledore knows you’re not of age, though,” said Ron.“Yeah, but he’s not the one who decides who the champion is, is he?” said
Fred shrewdly. “Sounds to me like once this judge knows who w ione patted Hagrid’s shoulder, looking at a complete loss for anything
to say. Harry knew how she felt. He had known Hagrid to present a vicious
baby dragon with a teddy bear, seen him croon over giant scorpions with
suckers and stingers, attempt to reason with his brutal giant of a half-brother,

gigantic talking spider, Aragog, who dwelled deep in the Forbidden Forest

box. Harry opened it with trembling fingers. Inside was a large, sticky
chocolate cake with

Harry looked up at the giant. He meant to say thank you, but the words got
lost on the way to his mouth, and what he said instead was, “Who are you?”
The giant chuckled.
“True, I haven’t introduced meself. Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and
Grounds at Hogwarts.”He held out an enormous hand and shook Harry’s whole arm.
“What about that te  life?” said Harry loudly.
A few people looked around. Rita Skeeter’s eyes widened behind her
jeweled spectacles as she saw who had spoken.
“Harry!” she said, beaming. “How lovely! Why don’t you come and join

“I wouldn’t come near you with a ten-foot broomstick,” said Harry
furiously. “What did you do that to Hagrid for, eh?”
Rita Skeeter raised her heavily penciled eyebrows.
“Our readers have a right to the truth, Harry. I am merely doing my —”

seemed to be moving half as fast as a regular clock; perhaps Snape had
bewitched it to go extra slowly? He could not have been here for only half an
hour . . . an hour . . . an hour and a half. . . .
Harry’s stomach started rumbling when the clock showed half past twelve.
Snape, who had not spoken at all since setting Harry his task, finally looked
up at ten past one.
“I think that will do,” he said coldly. “Mark the pl did
believe these things when he was seventeen, but the whole of the rest of his
life was devoted to fighting the Dark Arts! Dumbledore was the one who

Muggle-born rights, who fought You-Know-Who from the start, and who died
trying to bring him down!”
Rita’s book lay on the ground between them, so that the face of Albus
Dumbledore smiled dolefully at both.

remembering how it had come to his aid when he had thought all hope was
lost, when he noticed a patch of silvery light, dancing and shimmering on the
glass case. He looked around for the source of the light and saw a sliver of
silver-white shining brightly from within a black cabinet beh and robes, who lined up with the other first years to
be sorted. He was placed in Slytherin House almost the moment that the
Sorting Hat touched his head,” continued Dumbledore, waving his blackened
hand toward the shelf over his head where the Sorting Hat sat, ancient and
unmoving. “How soon Riddle learned that the famous founder of the House
could talk to snakes, I do not know — perhaps that very evening. The
knowledge can only have excited him and increased his sense of self-
importance.
“However, if he  was in Dumbledore’s office,
knowing he would shortly be telling him about the dream. Harry looked up at
the walls behind the desk. The patched and ragged Sorting Hat was standing
on a shelf. A glass case next to it held a magnificent silver sword with large
rubies set into the hilt, which Harry recognized as the one he himself had
pulled out of the Sorting Hat in his second year. The sword had once belonged
to Godric Gryffindor, founder of Harry’s House. He was gazing at it,
remembering how it had come to h  you are here, your House will be something like
your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your
House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free time in your House

“The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and
Slytherin. Each House has its own noble history and each has produced
outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs
will earn your House points, while any rule-breaking will lose House points.
At the end of the ” inquired
Ron. He was tugging at the chain of the Horcrux around his neck: Harry was
visited by a desire to seize it and throttle him.
“You told us that You-Know-Who asked Dumbledore to give him a job
after he left,” said Hermione.
“That’s right,” said Harry.
“And Dumbledore thought he only wanted to come back to try and find
something, probably another founder’s object, to make into another
Horcrux?”
“Yeah,” said Harry.
“But he didn’t get the job, did he?” said Hermione. “So he never got the

“However, if he was frightening or impressing fellow Slytherins with
displays of Parseltongue in their common room, no hint of it reached the staff.
He showed no sign of outward arrogance or aggression at all. As an unusually
talented and very good-looking orphan, he natu  Harry again. “I was awake half the night thinking it all over, and I believe
it’s a plot to get the house.”
“The house?” repeated Harry. “What house?”
“
This 
house!” shrieked Uncle Vernon, the vein in his forehead starting to
pulse. “
Our
 house! House prices are skyrocketing around here! You want us
out of the way and then you’re going to do a bit of hocus-pocus and before weknow it the deeds will be in your name and —”
“Are you out of your mind?” demanded Harry. “A plot to get this house?

The Keeper of the Keys born girl who, like
Harry, is one of the top students in the school.
From the moment the article had appeared, Harry had had to endure people
— Slytherins, mainly — quoting it at him as he passed and making sneering
comments.
“Want a hanky, Potter, in case you start crying in Transfiguration?”
“Since when have you been one of the top students in the school, Potter?
Or is this a school you and Longbottom have set up together?”
“Hey — Harry!”“Yeah, that’s right!” Harry found himself shouting as he wheeled aro rs of his name rearranged
themselves:

“You see?” he whispered. “It was a name I was already using at Hogwarts,
to my most intimate friends only, of course. You think I was going to use my
filthy Muggle father’s name forever? I, in whose veins runs the blood of
Salazar Slytherin himself, through my mother’s side? I, keep the name of a
foul, common Muggle, who abandoned me even before I was born, just
because he found out his wife was a witch? No, Harry — I fashioned myself a
new name, a n  So I waited and watched. I used the map I had taken from Harry
Potter. The map that had almost ruined everything.”
“Map?” said Dumbledore quickly. “What map is this?”
“Potter’s map of Hogwarts. Potter saw me on it. Potter saw me stealing
more ingredients for the Polyjuice Potion from Snape’s office one night. He
thought I was my father. We have the same first name. I took the map from
Potter that night. I told him my father hated Dark wizards. Potter believed my
father was after Snape.
“For a week I waited ting from the egg in Filch’s arms to the
map in Moody’s hand, and Harry could tell he was putting two and two
together, as only Snape could. . . .
“Potter,” he said quietly.
“What’s that?” said Moody calmly, folding up the map and pocketing it.
“Potter!” Snape snarled, and he actually turned his head and stared right at
the place where Harry was, as though he could suddenly see him. “That egg is
Potter’s egg. That piece of parchment belongs to Potter. I have seen it before,
I recognize it! Potter is here! P ldemort,” said Riddle softly, “is my past, present, and future, Harry
Potter. . . .”
He pulled Harry’s wand from his pocket and began to trace it through the
air, writing three shimmering words:
TOM MARVOLO RIDDLE
Then he waved the wand once, and the letters of his name rearranged
themselves:
I AM LORD VOLDEMORT
