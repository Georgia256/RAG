Who is Harry Potter's best friend?,Ron Weasley,"According to the context, Harry Potter's best friend is Hermione Granger, who is described as one of his closest friends and a top student at Hogwarts.","” into
long, sickly sentences: She had interviewed other people about him too.
Harry has at last found love at Hogwarts. His close friend, Colin
Creevey, says that Harry is rarely seen out of the company of one
Hermione Granger, a stunningly pretty Muggle-born girl who, like
Harry, is one of the top students in the school.
From the moment the article had appeared, Harry had had to endure people
— Slytherins, mainly — quoting it at him as he passed and making sneering
comments.
“Want a hanky, Potter, in case ere you’re going, Potter!”
“Sorry, Professor —”
“I’ve just been looking for you in the Gryffindor common room. Well, here
it is, we’ve done everything we could think of, and there doesn’t seem to be
anything wrong with it at all. You’ve got a very good friend somewhere,Potter. . . .”
Harry’s jaw dropped. She was holding out his Firebolt, and it looked as
magnificent as ever.
“I can have it back?” Harry said weakly. “Seriously?”
“Seriously,” said Professor McGonagall, and she was actually smiling. “I

nor do I believe that he has ever wanted one.
“And lastly — I hope you are not too sleepy to pay attention to this, Harry
— the young Tom Riddle liked to collect trophies. You saw the box of stolen

What house is Harry Potter sorted into?,Gryffindor,"According to the text, Harry Potter is sorted into Gryffindor House.","f, Ravenclaw, and
Slytherin. Each House has its own noble history and each has produced
outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs
will earn your House points, while any rule-breaking will lose House points.
At the end of the year, the House with the most points is awarded the House
Cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever House
becomes yours.
“The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest
of the school. I suggest you al  year, the House with the most points is awarded the House
Cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever House
becomes yours.
“The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest
of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can
while you are waiting.”
Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville’s cloak, which was fastened
under his left ear, and on Ron’s smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to
flatten his hair.
“I shall return when we are r 
about nervously.
“Welcome to Hogwarts,” said Professor McGonagall. “The start-of-term
banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall,
you will be sorted into your Houses. The Sorting is a very importantceremony because, while you are here, your House will be something like
your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your
House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free time in your House

What is the name of Harry Potter's owl?,Hedwig,"According to the text, Harry Potter's owl is named Hedwig.","rry Potter’s, incidentally, who fought the Death Eaters
alongside him at the Ministry in June and —”
But the rest of this story was obscured by the large birdcage standing on
top of it. Inside it was a magnificent snowy owl. Her amber eyes surveyed the
room imperiously, her head swiveling occasionally to gaze at her snoring
master. Once or twice she clicked her beak impatiently, but Harry was too
deeply asleep to hear her.
A large trunk stood in the very middle of the room. Its lid was open; it
looked expec ng, jewel-bright eyes. Harry now carried a
large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep with her head under her
wing. He couldn’t stop stammering his thanks, sounding just like Professor
Quirrell.
“Don’ mention it,” said Hagrid gruffly. “Don’ expect you’ve had a lotta
presents from them Dursleys. Just Ollivanders left now — only place fer
wands, Ollivanders, and yeh gotta have the best wand.”
A magic wand . . . this was what Harry had been really looking forward to.
The last shop was narrow and s He
brought it carefully inside. The owl dropped its letter onto Harry’s seat and
began zooming around their compartment, apparently very pleased with itself
for accomplishing its task. Hedwig clicked her beak with a sort of dignified
disapproval. Crookshanks sat up in his seat, following the owl with his great
yellow eyes. Ron, noticing this, snatched the owl safely out of harm’s way.
Harry picked up the letter. It was addressed to him. He ripped open the
letter, and shouted, “It’s from Sirius!”

“Dean Thomas.”
“Well, Mr. Thomas?”
“Well, it’s like Harry said, isn’t it?”  lay and returned with Harry’s wand, which he thrust
roughly into Harry’s hand without looking at him. Then Wormtail resumed his
place in the circle of watching Death Eaters.
“You have been taught how to duel, Harry Potter?” said Voldemort softly,
his red eyes glinting through the darkness.
At these words Harry remembered, as though from a former life, the
dueling club at Hogwarts he had attended briefly two years ago. . . . All he
had learned there was the Disarming Spell,

 Harry yelled. The spell hit the skrewt’s armor again and
ricocheted off; Harry staggered back a few paces and fell over.
“IMPEDIMENTA!”
The skrewt was inches from him when it froze — he had managed to hit it
on its fleshy, shell-less underside. Panting, Harry pushed himself away from it
and ran, hard, in the opposite direction — the Impediment Curse was not
permanent; the skrewt would be regaining the use of its legs at any moment.
He took a left path and hit a dead end, a right, and hit another; forcin"

steaming between the wooden desks, on which stood brass scales and jars of

What is the name of the Weasley's house?,The Burrow,"According to the passage, the Weasley's house is not explicitly mentioned. However, it is mentioned that Mr. Weasley is working at a place, and later it is implied that he is working on the second floor, which is likely referring to a Muggle artifact shop.

casually against the barrier, chatting unconcernedly, and slid sideways
through it . . . and as they did so, platform nine and three-quarters
materialized in front of them.
The Hogwarts Express, a gleaming scarlet steam engine, was already there,
clouds of steam billowing from it, through which the many Hogwarts students
and parents on the platform appeared like dark ghosts. Pigwidgeon became
noisier than ever in response to the hooting of many owls through the mist.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione se  the journey passed pleasantly enough; Harry wished it could
have gone on all summer, in fact, and that he would never arrive at King’s
Cross . . . but as he had learned the hard way that year, time will not slow

What position does Harry play on his Quidditch team?,Seeker,"According to the text, Harry is a Seeker on the Gryffindor Quidditch team.","look like he’ll be fit for next
week’s match.”
It took Harry a few moments to realize what McLaggen was talking about.
“Oh . . . right . . . Quidditch,” he said, putting his wand back into the belt of
his jeans and running a hand wearily through his hair. “Yeah . . . he might not
make it.”
“Well, then, I’ll be playing Keeper, won’t I?” said McLaggen.
“Yeah,” said Harry. “Yeah, I suppose so. . . .”
He could not think of an argument against it; after all, McLaggen had
certainly performed second-best in the tr ditch, the most popular sport in the magical world — highly
dangerous, very exciting, and played on broomsticks. Harry happened to be a
very good Quidditch player; he had been the youngest person in a century to
be picked for one of the Hogwarts House teams. One of Harry’s most prized
possessions was his Nimbus Two Thousand racing broom.
Harry put the leather case aside and picked up his last parcel. He
recognized the untidy scrawl on the brown paper at once: This was from
Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper. H rs windows defrosting broomsticks on the Quidditch field, bundled up
in a long moleskin overcoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous beaverskin

The Quidditch season had begun. On Saturday, Harry would be playing in

Gryffindor won, they would move up into second place in the House
Championship.

stopped talking about him a split second before. He had more important
things to worry about, however: He was looking over the students’ heads to
the staff table that ran along the top wall of the Hall.
“He’s not there.”
Ron and Hermione scanned the staff table too, though there was no real
need; Hagrid’s size made him instantly obvious in any the Slytherins, the Ravenclaws,
and the Hufflepuffs, and sat down with the rest of the Gryffindors at the farside of the Hall, next to Nearly Headless Nick, the Gryffindor ghost. Pearly
white and semitransparent, Nick was dressed tonight in his usual doublet, but
with a particularly large ruff, which served the dual purpose of looking extra-
festive, and insuring that his head didn’t wobble too much on his partially
severed neck.
“Good evening,” he said, beaming at them.
“Says who?” said Harry, taking off h s or
siblings. . . .
Harry caught sight of a pearly white figure drifting across the entrance hall
below and yelled as loudly as he could over the clamor.
“Nick! NICK! I need to talk to you!”
He forced his way back through the tide of students, finally reaching the
bottom of the stairs, where Nearly Headless Nick, ghost of Gryffindor Tower,
stood waiting for him.

“Did sir just call me Dobby?” squeaked the elf curiously from between its

like some kind of enchantment. He wondered whether he might be able to
blast it out of the way.

The spell shot straight through the mist, leaving it intact. He supposed he
should have known better; the Reductor Curse was for solid objects. What
would happen if he walked through the mist? Was it worth chancing it, or
should he double back?
He was still hesitating when a scream shattered the silence.
“Fleur?” Harry yelled.
There was silence. "

Harry, Ron, and Hermione had already had two Defense Against the Dark
Arts teachers, both of whom had lasted only one year. There were rumors that
the job was jinxed.

They had never yet had a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher who had

“Of course, my Lord,” said Lucius Malf serpent, which relinquished its hold
upon Voldemort at once and turned, hissing furiously, to face Dumbledore.
Voldemort vanished. The snake reared from the floor, ready to strike —
There was a burst of flame in midair above Dumbledore just as Voldemort

the five statues had stood.
“Look out!” 
Harry yelled.
But even as he shouted, one more jet of green light had flown at
Dumbledore from Voldemort’s wand and the snake had struck — promptly. “Please continue.”
