Who is Harry Potter's best friend?,Ron Weasley,"According to the given context, Harry Potter's best friends are Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley.","
sniggered, but Slughorn showed no dismay; on the contrary, he beamed and
looked from Hermione to Harry, who was sitting next to her.
“Oho! 
‘One of my best friends is Muggle-born, and she’s the best in our
year!’
 I’m assuming this is the very friend of whom you spoke, Harry?”
“Yes, sir,” said Harry.
“Well, well, take twenty well-earned points for Gryffindor, Miss Granger,”
said Slughorn genially.
Malfoy looked rather as he had done the time Hermione had punched him
in the face. Hermione turned to Harry with a radiant expression and
whispered, “Did you really tell him I’m the best in the year? Oh, Harry!”
“Well, what’s so impressive about that?” whispered Ron, who for somereason looked annoyed. “You 
are
 the best in the year — I’d’ve told him so if
he’d asked me!”
Hermione smiled but made a “shhing” gesture, so that they could hear what
Slughorn was saying. Ron looked slightly disgruntled.
“Amortentia doesn’t really create 
love,
 of course. It is impossible to
manufacture or imitate love. No, this will sim . Again, your readers will have to buy my book for the
whole story, but there is no question that Dumbledore took an unnatural
interest in Potter from the word go. Whether that was really in the boy’s
best interests — well, we’ll see. It’s certainly an open secret that Potter
has had a most troubled adolescence.”
I ask whether Skeeter is still in touch with Harry Potter, whom she so
famously interviewed last year: a breakthrough piece in which Potter
spoke exclusively of his conviction that You-Know-Who had returned.
“Oh, yes, we’ve developed a close bond,” says Skeeter. “Poor Potter
has few real friends, and we met at one of the most testing moments of
his life — the Triwizard Tournament. I am probably one of the only
people alive who can say that they know the real Harry Potter.”
Which leads us neatly to the many rumors still circulating about
Dumbledore’s final hours. Does Skeeter believe that Potter was there
when Dumbledore died?
“Well, I don’t want to say too much — it’s all in the book — but
eyewitness tion of the mouthpiece. “WHO
ARE YOU?”
“RON — WEASLEY!” Ron bellowed back, as though he and Uncle
Vernon were speaking from opposite ends of a football field. “I’M — A —
FRIEND — OF — HARRY’S — FROM — SCHOOL —”
Uncle Vernon’s small eyes swiveled around to Harry, who was rooted to the
spot.
“THERE IS NO HARRY POTTER HERE!” he roared, now holding the
receiver at arm’s length, as though frightened it might explode. “I DON’T
KNOW WHAT SCHOOL YOU’RE TALKING ABOUT! NEVER
CONTACT ME AGAIN! DON’T YOU COME NEAR MY FAMILY!”
And he threw the receiver back onto the telephone as if dropping a
poisonous spider.The fight that had followed had been one of the worst ever.
“HOW DARE YOU GIVE THIS NUMBER TO PEOPLE LIKE —
PEOPLE LIKE 
YOU
!”
 
Uncle Vernon had roared, spraying Harry with spit.
Ron obviously realized that he’d gotten Harry into trouble, because he
hadn’t called again. Harry’s other best friend from Hogwarts, Hermione
Granger, hadn’t been in touch either. Harry suspected that Ron had warned
Hermione not to call, w “Ah, speak not the
name, sir! Speak not the name!”
“Sorry,” said Harry quickly. “I know lots of people don’t like it. My friend
Ron —”
He stopped again. Thinking about Ron was painful, too.
Dobby leaned toward Harry, his eyes wide as headlights.
“Dobby heard tell,” he said hoarsely, “that Harry Potter met the Dark Lord
for a second time, just weeks ago . . . that Harry Potter escaped 
yet again.
”
Harry nodded and Dobby’s eyes suddenly shone with tears.
“Ah, sir,” he gasped, dabbing his face with a corner of the grubby
pillowcase he was wearing. “Harry Potter is valiant and bold! He has braved
so many dangers already! But Dobby has come to protect Harry Potter, to
warn him, even if he 
does
 have to shut his ears in the oven door later. . . .
Harry Potter must not go back to Hogwarts.
”
There was a silence broken only by the chink of knives and forks from
downstairs and the distant rumble of Uncle Vernon’s voice.
“W-what?” Harry stammered. “But I’ve got to go back — term starts on

CHAPTER  ONE
THE BOY WHO LIVED
r. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say
that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much caped to one of
the giant communities still existing in foreign mountain ranges. If
his antics during Care of Magical Creatures lessons are any guide,
however, Fridwulfa’s son appears to have inherited her brutal
nature.
In a bizarre twist, Hagrid is reputed to have developed a close
friendship with the boy who brought around You-Know-Who’s fall
from power — thereby driving Hagrid’s own mother, like the rest of
You-Know-Who’s supporters, into hiding. Perhaps Harry Potter is
unaware of the unpleasant truth about his large friend — but Albus
Dumbledore surely has a duty to ensure that Harry Potter, along
with his fellow students, is warned about the dangers of associating
with part-giants.
Harry finished reading and looked up at Ron, whose mouth was hanging
open.
“How did she find out?” he whispered.
But that wasn’t what was bothering Harry.
“What d’you mean, ‘we all hate Hagrid’?” Harry spat at Malfoy. “What’s
this rubbish about 
him
”
 — 
he pointed at Crabbe — “getting a bad bite off a
flobberworm? They have arry as Dobby pulled on Harry’s
sock with shaking hands. “You told me all this had nothing to do with He-
Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, remember? Well —”
“It was a clue, sir,” said Dobby, his eyes widening, as though this was
obvious. “Was giving you a clue. The Dark Lord, before he changed his
name, could be freely named, you see?”
“Right,” said Harry weakly. “Well, I’d better go. There’s a feast, and my
friend Hermione should be awake by now. . . .”
Dobby threw his arms around Harry’s middle and hugged him.
“Harry Potter is greater by far than Dobby knew!” he sobbed. “Farewell,
Harry Potter!”
And with a final loud crack, Dobby disappeared.
Harry had been to several Hogwarts feasts, but never one quite like this.
Everybody was in their pajamas, and the celebration lasted all night. Harry
didn’t know whether the best bit was Hermione running toward him,
screaming “You solved it! You solved it!” or Justin hurrying over from the
Hufflepuff table to wring his hand and apologize endlessly for suspecting
him, or Hagrid t oduced him to the wizards on
either side of him.
“Harry Potter, you know,” he told the Bulgarian minister loudly, who was
wearing splendid robes of black velvet trimmed with gold and didn’t seem to
understand a word of English. “
Harry Potter
 . . . oh come on now, you know
who he is . . . the boy who survived You-Know-Who . . . you 
do
 know who he
is —”
The Bulgarian wizard suddenly spotted Harry’s scar and started gabbling
loudly and excitedly, pointing at it.
“Knew we’d get there in the end,” said Fudge wearily to Harry. “I’m no
great shakes at languages; I need Barty Crouch for this sort of thing. Ah, I see
his house-elf’s saving him a seat. . . . Good job too, these Bulgarian blighters
have been trying to cadge all the best places . . . ah, and here’s Lucius!”
Harry, Ron, and Hermione turned quickly. Edging along the second row to
three still-empty seats right behind Mr. Weasley were none other than Dobby
the house-elf’s former owners: Lucius Malfoy; his son, Draco; and a woman

What house is Harry Potter sorted into?,Gryffindor,"According to the passage, Harry Potter is sorted into Gryffindor House.","rom a doorway to the right — the
rest of the school must already be here — but Professor McGonagall showed
the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in,
standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering
about nervously.
“Welcome to Hogwarts,” said Professor McGonagall. “The start-of-term
banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall,
you will be sorted into your Houses. The Sorting is a very importantceremony because, while you are here, your House will be something like
your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your
House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free time in your House
common room.
“The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and
Slytherin. Each House has its own noble history and each has produced
outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs
will earn your House points, while any rule-breaking will lose House points.
At the end of the ter,” said Winky
firmly, from behind her hands. “House-elves does what they is told. I is not
liking heights at all, Harry Potter” — she glanced toward the edge of the box
and gulped — “but my master sends me to the Top Box and I comes, sir.”
“Why’s he sent you up here, if he knows you don’t like heights?” said
Harry, frowning.
“Master — master wants me to save him a seat, Harry Potter. He is very
busy,” said Winky, tilting her head toward the empty space beside her.
“Winky is wishing she is back in master’s tent, Harry Potter, but Winky does
what she is told. Winky is a good house-elf.”
She gave the edge of the box another frightened look and hid her eyes
completely again. Harry turned back to the others.
“So that’s a house-elf?” Ron muttered. “Weird things, aren’t they?”
“Dobby was weirder,” said Harry fervently.
Ron pulled out his Omnioculars and started testing them, staring down into
the crowd on the other side of the stadium.
“Wild!” he said, twiddling the replay knob on the side. “I can make that old
b pened behind Harry. A woman spoke, and the
sound of the voice wound Harry’s fear to an even higher pitch.
“What is this? What’s happened, Cissy?”
Bellatrix Lestrange walked slowly around the prisoners, and stopped on
Harry’s right, staring at Hermione through her heavily lidded eyes.
“But surely,” she said quietly, “this is the Mudblood girl? This is Granger?”
“Yes, yes, it’s Granger!” cried Lucius. “And beside her, we think, Potter!
Potter and his friends, caught at last!”
“Potter?” shrieked Bellatrix, and she backed away, the better to take in
Harry. “Are you sure? Well then, the Dark Lord must be informed at once!”
She dragged back her left sleeve: Harry saw the Dark Mark burned into the
flesh of her arm, and knew that she was about to touch it, to summon her
beloved master —
“I was about to call him!” said Lucius, and his hand actually closed upon
Bellatrix’s wrist, preventing her from touching the Mark. “

authori  long line
of scared-looking first years filing into the Hall. Ginny was among them,
easily visible because of her vivid Weasley hair. Meanwhile, Professor
McGonagall, a bespectacled witch with her hair in a tight bun, was placing
the famous Hogwarts Sorting Hat on a stool before the newcomers.
Every year, this aged old hat, patched, frayed, and dirty, sorted new
students into the four Hogwarts Houses (Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw,
and Slytherin). Harry well remembered putting it on, exactly one year ago,and waiting, petrified, for its decision as it muttered aloud in his ear. For a
few horrible seconds he had feared that the hat was going to put him in
Slytherin, the House that had turned out more Dark witches and wizards than
any other — but he had ended up in Gryffindor, along with Ron, Hermione,
and the rest of the Weasleys. Last term, Harry and Ron had helped Gryffindor
win the House Championship, beating Slytherin for the first time in seven
years.
A very small, mousy-haired boy had been called for e wizard with a shock of white hair, was carrying an ancient hat and a
four-legged stool out of the hall.
“Oh,” said Hermione softly, “we’ve missed the Sorting!”
New students at Hogwarts were sorted into Houses by trying on the Sorting
Hat, which shouted out the House they were best suited to (Gryffindor,
Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, or Slytherin). Professor McGonagall strode off toward
her empty seat at the staff table, and Harry and Hermione set off in the other
direction, as quietly as possible, toward the Gryffindor table. People looked
around at them as they passed along the back of the hall, and a few of them
pointed at Harry. Had the story of his collapsing in front of the dementor
traveled that fast?He and Hermione sat down on either side of Ron, who had saved them
seats.
“What was all that about?” he muttered to Harry.
Harry started to explain in a whisper, but at that moment the headmaster
stood up to speak, and he broke off.
Professor Dumbledore, though very old, always gave an impression of
great energy shook his hand
vigorously, while the Weasley twins yelled, “We got Potter! We got Potter!”
Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff he’d seen earlier. The ghost
patted his arm, giving Harry the sudden, horrible feeling he’d just plunged it
into a bucket of ice-cold water.He could see the High Table properly now. At the end nearest him sat
Hagrid, who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up. Harry grinned back.
And there, in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair, sat Albus
Dumbledore. Harry recognized him at once from the card he’d gotten out of
the Chocolate Frog on the train. Dumbledore’s silver hair was the only thing
in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts. Harry spotted Professor
Quirrell, too, the nervous young man from the Leaky Cauldron. He was
looking very peculiar in a large purple turban.
And now there were only four people left to be sorted. “Thomas, Dean,” a
black boy even taller than Ron, joined Harry at the Gryffindor table. “Turpin,
Lisa,” became a Ravenclaw  . Again, your readers will have to buy my book for the
whole story, but there is no question that Dumbledore took an unnatural
interest in Potter from the word go. Whether that was really in the boy’s
best interests — well, we’ll see. It’s certainly an open secret that Potter

Dumbledore’s final hours. Does Skeeter believe that Potter was there
when Dumbledore died?
“Well, I don’t want to say too much — it’s all in the book — but
eyewitness rry looked up at his uncle and felt a mixture of exasperation and
amusement. Vernon Dursley had been changing his mind every twenty-four
hours for the past four weeks, packing and unpacking and repacking the car
with every change of heart. Harry’s favorite moment had been the one when
Uncle Vernon, unaware that Dudley had added his dumbbells to his case since
the last time it had been unpacked, had attempted to hoist it back into the boot
and collapsed with roars of pain and much swearing.
“According to you,” Vernon Dursley said now, resuming his pacing up and
down the living room, “we — Petunia, Dudley, and I — are in danger. From
— from —”
“Some of ‘my lot,’ right,” said Harry.
“Well, I don’t believe it,” repeated Uncle Vernon, coming to a halt in front
of Harry again. “I was awake half the night thinking it all over, and I believe
it’s a plot to get the house.”
“The house?” repeated Harry. “What house?”
“
This 
house!” shrieked Uncle Vernon, the vein in his forehead starting to
pulse. “

What is the name of Harry Potter's owl?,Hedwig,The name of Harry Potter's owl is Hedwig.,"er his shoulder. “What’s thatthing outside your window?”
Harry turned to look outside. Something very small and gray was bobbing
in and out of sight beyond the glass. He stood up for a better look and saw
that it was a tiny owl, carrying a letter that was much too big for it. The owl
was so small, in fact, that it kept tumbling over in the air, buffeted this way
and that in the train’s slipstream. Harry quickly pulled down the window,
stretched out his arm, and caught it. It felt like a very fluffy Snitch. He
brought it carefully inside. The owl dropped its letter onto Harry’s seat and
began zooming around their compartment, apparently very pleased with itself
for accomplishing its task. Hedwig clicked her beak with a sort of dignified
disapproval. Crookshanks sat up in his seat, following the owl with his great
yellow eyes. Ron, noticing this, snatched the owl safely out of harm’s way.
Harry picked up the letter. It was addressed to him. He ripped open the
letter, and shouted, “It’s from Sirius!”
“What?” sai d Ron and Hermione excitedly. “Read it aloud!”
Dear Harry,
I hope this finds you before you reach your aunt and uncle. I don’t
know whether they’re used to owl post.
Buckbeak and I are in hiding. I won’t tell you where, in case this falls
into the wrong hands. I have some doubt about the owl’s reliability, but
he is the best I could find, and he did seem eager for the job.
I believe the dementors are still searching for me, but they haven’t a
hope of finding me here. I am planning to allow some Muggles to
glimpse me soon, a long way from Hogwarts, so that the security on the
castle will be lifted.
There is something I never got around to telling you during our brief
meeting. It was I who sent you the Firebolt —
“Ha!” said Hermione triumphantly. “See! I 
told
 you it was from him!”
“Yes, but he hadn’t jinxed it, had he?” said Ron. “Ouch!”
The tiny owl, now hooting happily in his hand, had nibbled one of hisfingers in what it seemed to think was an affectionate way.
Crookshanks took the order to the Owl Office  denly a loud tapping noise.
And there’s Aunt Petunia knocking on the door,
 Harry thought, his heart
sinking. But he still didn’t open his eyes. It had been such a good dream.
Tap. Tap. Tap.
“All right,” Harry mumbled, “I’m getting up.”
He sat up and Hagrid’s heavy coat fell off him. The hut was full of sunlight,
the storm was over, Hagrid himself was asleep on the collapsed sofa, and
there was an owl rapping its claw on the window, a newspaper held in its
beak.
Harry scrambled to his feet, so happy he felt as though a large balloon was
swelling inside him. He went straight to the window and jerked it open. The
owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of Hagrid, who didn’t
wake up. The owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to attack Hagrid’scoat.
“Don’t do that.”
Harry tried to wave the owl out of the way, but it snapped its beak fiercely
at him and carried on savaging the coat.
“Hagrid!” said Harry loudly. “There’s an owl —”
“Pay him,” Hagrid grunted into the sofa.
“What?”
“He wants payin’ fer d rs of his name rearranged
themselves:
I AM LORD VOLDEMORT
“You see?” he whispered. “It was a name I was already using at Hogwarts,
to my most intimate friends only, of course. You think I was going to use my
filthy Muggle father’s name forever? I, in whose veins runs the blood of
Salazar Slytherin himself, through my mother’s side? I, keep the name of a
foul, common Muggle, who abandoned me even before I was born, just
because he found out his wife was a witch? No, Harry — I fashioned myself a
new name, a name I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak,when I had become the greatest sorcerer in the world!”
Harry’s brain seemed to have jammed. He stared numbly at Riddle, at the
orphaned boy who had grown up to murder Harry’s own parents, and so many
others. . . . At last he forced himself to speak.
“You’re not,” he said, his quiet voice full of hatred.
“Not what?” snapped Riddle.
“Not the greatest sorcerer in the world,” said Harry, breathing fast. “Sorry
to disappoint you and all that, but the grea “Ah, speak not the
name, sir! Speak not the name!”
“Sorry,” said Harry quickly. “I know lots of people don’t like it. My friend
Ron —”
He stopped again. Thinking about Ron was painful, too.
Dobby leaned toward Harry, his eyes wide as headlights.
“Dobby heard tell,” he said hoarsely, “that Harry Potter met the Dark Lord
for a second time, just weeks ago . . . that Harry Potter escaped 
yet again.
”
Harry nodded and Dobby’s eyes suddenly shone with tears.
“Ah, sir,” he gasped, dabbing his face with a corner of the grubby
pillowcase he was wearing. “Harry Potter is valiant and bold! He has braved
so many dangers already! But Dobby has come to protect Harry Potter, to
warn him, even if he 
does
 have to shut his ears in the oven door later. . . .
Harry Potter must not go back to Hogwarts.
”
There was a silence broken only by the chink of knives and forks from
downstairs and the distant rumble of Uncle Vernon’s voice.
“W-what?” Harry stammered. “But I’ve got to go back — term starts on
September first. It’s all th We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a listof all necessary books and equipment.
Term begins on September 1. We await your owl by no later than July
31.
Yours sincerely,
Minerva McGonagall,
Deputy Headmistress
Questions exploded inside Harry’s head like fireworks and he couldn’t decide
which to ask first. After a few minutes he stammered, “What does it mean,
they await my owl?”
“Gallopin’ Gorgons, that reminds me,” said Hagrid, clapping a hand to his
forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse, and from yet another
pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl — a real, live, rather ruffled-
looking owl — a long quill, and a roll of parchment. With his tongue between
his teeth he scribbled a note that Harry could read upside down:
Dear Professor Dumbledore,
Given Harry his letter.
Taking him to buy his things tomorrow.
Weather’s horrible. Hope you’re well.
Hagrid
Hagrid rolled up the note, gave it to the owl, which k at Sirius’s letter.
“Hang on, there’s a P.S. . . .”
I thought your friend Ron might like to keep this owl, as it’s my fault
he no longer has a rat.
Ron’s eyes widened. The minute owl was still hooting excitedly.
“Keep him?” he said uncertainly. He looked closely at the owl for a
moment; then, to Harry’s and Hermione’s great surprise, he held him out for
Crookshanks to sniff.
“What d’you reckon?” Ron asked the cat. “Definitely an owl?”Crookshanks purred.
“That’s good enough for me,” said Ron happily. “He’s mine.”
Harry read and reread the letter from Sirius all the way back into King’s
Cross station. It was still clutched tightly in his hand as he, Ron, and
Hermione stepped back through the barrier of platform nine and three-
quarters. Harry spotted Uncle Vernon at once. He was standing a good
distance from Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, eyeing them suspiciously, and when
Mrs. Weasley hugged Harry in greeting, his worst suspicions about them
seemed confirmed.
“I’ll call about the World Cup!” Ron yelled after Harry as ised if he doesn’t
win,” said Moody. “In the meantime . . . constant vigilance, Potter. Constant
vigilance.” He took another long draw from his hip flask, and his magical eye
swiveled onto the window. The topmost sail of the Durmstrang ship was
visible through it.
“You two,” counseled Moody, his normal eye on Ron and Hermione, “you
stick close to Potter, all right? I’m keeping an eye on things, but all thesame . . . you can never have too many eyes out.”
Sirius sent their owl back the very next morning. It fluttered down beside
Harry at the same moment that a tawny owl landed in front of Hermione,
clutching a copy of the 
Daily Prophet
 in its beak. She took the newspaper,
scanned the first few pages, said, “Ha! She hasn’t got wind of Crouch!” then
joined Ron and Harry in reading what Sirius had to say on the mysterious
events of the night before last.
Harry — what do you think you are playing at, walking off into the
forest with Viktor Krum? I want you to swear, by return owl, that
you are not going to go wa"
Who is the headmaster of Hogwarts?,Albus Dumbledore,"According to the text, the headmaster of Hogwarts is Dumbledore, who has been suspended by the governors.","he had just been appointed Head Boy. Harry didn’t realize what he was so
pleased about until the Potions lesson about two weeks after Dumbledore and
Hagrid had left, when, sitting right behind Malfoy, Harry overheard him
gloating to Crabbe and Goyle.
“I always thought Father might be the one who got rid of Dumbledore,” he
said, not troubling to keep his voice down. “I told you he thinks
Dumbledore’s the worst headmaster the school’s ever had. Maybe we’ll get a
decent headmaster now. Someone who won’t 
want
 the Chamber of Secrets
closed. McGonagall won’t last long, she’s only filling in. . . .”
Snape swept past Harry, making no comment about Hermione’s empty seat
and cauldron.
“Sir,” said Malfoy loudly. “Sir, why don’t 
you 
apply for the headmaster’s
job?”
“Now, now, Malfoy,” said Snape, though he couldn’t suppress a thin-lipped
smile. “Professor Dumbledore has only been suspended by the governors. I
daresay he’ll be back with us soon enough.”
“Yeah, right,” said Malfoy, smirking. “I expect you’d have Father  the Hogwarts Express to come
tomorrow if necessary —”
“What about Dumbledore’s funeral?” said Harry, speaking at last.
“Well . . .” said Professor McGonagall, losing a little of her briskness as her
voice shook. “I — I know that it was Dumbledore’s wish to be laid to rest
here, at Hogwarts —”
“Then that’s what’ll happen, isn’t it?” said Harry fiercely.
“If the Ministry thinks it appropriate,” said Professor McGonagall. “No
other headmaster or headmistress has ever been —”
“No other headmaster or headmistress ever gave more to this school,”
growled Hagrid.
“Hogwarts should be Dumbledore’s final resting place,” said Professor
Flitwick.
“Absolutely,” said Professor Sprout.
“And in that case,” said Harry, “you shouldn’t send the students home until
the funeral’s over. They’ll want to say —”
The last word caught in his throat, but Professor Sprout completed the
sentence for him.
“Good-bye.”
“Well said,” squeaked Professor Flitwick. “Well said indeed! Our students
should pay tribute, it is fitting. We can arrange  werewolf Remus Lupin, half-giant Rubeus Hagrid, and delusional
ex-Auror ‘Mad-Eye’ Moody.
“Rumors abound, of course, that Albus Dumbledore, once Supreme
Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards and Chief Warlock
of the Wizengamot, is no longer up to the task of managing the prestigious
school of Hogwarts.
“‘I think the appointment of the Inquisitor is a first step toward ensuring
that Hogwarts has a headmaster in whom we can all repose confidence,’ said
a Ministry insider last night.
“Wizengamot elders Griselda Marchbanks and Tiberius Ogden have
resigned in protest at the introduction of the post of Inquisitor to Hogwarts.
“‘Hogwarts is a school, not an outpost of Cornelius Fudge’s office,’ said
Madam Marchbanks. ‘This is a further disgusting attempt to discredit Albus
Dumbledore.’ (For a full account of Madam Marchbanks’ alleged links to
subversive goblin groups, turn to page 17.)”
Hermione finished reading and looked across the table at the other two.
“So now we know how we ended up with Umbridg thoughts, and he did not slow down until he
reached the stone gargoyle guarding the headmaster’s office.
“Password?”
“Dumbledore!” said Harry without thinking, because it was he whom he
yearned to see, and to his surprise the gargoyle slid aside, revealing the spiral
staircase behind.
But when Harry burst into the circular office he found a change. Theportraits that hung all around the walls were empty. Not a single headmaster
or headmistress remained to see him; all, it seemed, had flitted away, charging
through the paintings that lined the castle, so that they could have a clear view
of what was going on.
Harry glanced hopelessly at Dumbledore’s deserted frame, which hung
directly behind the headmaster’s chair, then turned his back on it. The stone
Pensieve lay in the cabinet where it had always been: Harry heaved it onto the
desk and poured Snape’s memories into the wide basin with its runic
markings around the edge. To escape into someone else’s head would be a
blessed relief. . . . Nothing that even Snap you please, Master Harry, and hands washed before dinner,”
croaked Kreacher, seizing the Invisibility Cloak and slouching off to hang iton a hook on the wall, beside a number of old-fashioned robes that had been
freshly laundered.
“What’s happened?” Ron asked apprehensively. He and Hermione had
been poring over a sheaf of scribbled notes and hand-drawn maps that littered
the end of the long kitchen table, but now they watched Harry as he strode
toward them and threw down the newspaper on top of their scattered
parchment.
A large picture of a familiar, hook-nosed, black-haired man stared up at
them all, beneath a headline that read:
SEVERUS SNAPE CONFIRMED AS HOGWARTS HEADMASTER
“No!” said Ron and Hermione loudly.
Hermione was quickest; she snatched up the newspaper and began to read
the accompanying story out loud.
“‘Severus Snape, long-standing Potions master at Hogwarts School of
Witchcraft and Wizardry, was today appointed headmaster in the most
important of several staffing changes at the ancient school.  Order of
Dismissal signed by myself and the Minister of Magic. Under the terms of
Educational Decree Number Twenty-three, the High Inquisitor of Hogwarts
has the power to inspect, place upon probation, and sack any teacher she —
that is to say, I — feel is not performing up to the standard required by the
Ministry of Magic. I have decided that Professor Trelawney is not up to
scratch. I have dismissed her.”
To Harry’s very great surprise, Dumbledore continued to smile. He looked
down at Professor Trelawney, who was still sobbing and choking on her
trunk, and said, “You are quite right, of course, Professor Umbridge. As High
Inquisitor you have every right to dismiss my teachers. You do not, however,
have the authority to send them away from the castle. I am afraid,” he went
on, with a courteous little bow, “that the power to do that still resides with the
headmaster, and it is my wish that Professor Trelawney continue to live at
Hogwarts.”
At this, Professor Trelawney gave a wild little laugh in which a hiccu appened at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and
Wizardry.”
“That’s where I am now,” Harry wrote quickly. “I’m at Hogwarts, and
horrible stuff’s been happening. Do you know anything about the Chamber of
Secrets?”
His heart was hammering. Riddle’s reply came quickly, his writingbecoming untidier, as though he was hurrying to tell all he knew.
“Of course I know about the Chamber of Secrets. In my day, they told us it
was a legend, that it did not exist. But this was a lie. In my fifth year, the
Chamber was opened and the monster attacked several students, finally
killing one. I caught the person who’d opened the Chamber and he was
expelled. But the headmaster, Professor Dippet, ashamed that such a thing
had happened at Hogwarts, forbade me to tell the truth. A story was given out
that the girl had died in a freak accident. They gave me a nice, shiny,
engraved trophy for my trouble and warned me to keep my mouth shut. But I
knew it could happen again. The monster lived on, and the one who had the
power to release it arge animals, they were
able to keep a werewolf in check. I doubt whether any Hogwarts students ever
found out more about the Hogwarts grounds and Hogsmeade than we did. . . .
And that’s how we came to write the Marauder’s Map, and sign it with our
nicknames. Sirius is Padfoot. Peter is Wormtail. James was Prongs.”
“What sort of animal — ?” Harry began, but Hermione cut him off.
“That was still really dangerous! Running around in the dark with a
werewolf! What if you’d given the others the slip, and bitten somebody?”
“A thought that still haunts me,” said Lupin heavily. “And there were near
misses, many of them. We laughed about them afterwards. We were young,
thoughtless — carried away with our own cleverness.
“I sometimes felt guilty about betraying Dumbledore’s trust, of course . . .
he had admitted me to Hogwarts when no other headmaster would have done
so, and he had no idea I was breaking the rules he had set down for my own
and others’ safety. He never knew I had led three fellow students into
becoming"
What spell is used to disarm an opponent?,Expelliarmus,The spell used to disarm an opponent is Expelliarmus.," Slytherin girl who
reminded Harry of a picture he’d seen in 
Holidays with Hags.
 She was large
and square and her heavy jaw jutted aggressively. Hermione gave her a weak
smile that she did not return.
“Face your partners!” called Lockhart, back on the platform. “And bow!”
Harry and Malfoy barely inclined their heads, not taking their eyes off each
other.
“Wands at the ready!” shouted Lockhart. “When I count to three, cast your
charms to Disarm your opponents — 
only
 to disarm them — we don’t want
any accidents — one . . . two . . . three —”
Harry swung his wand high, but Malfoy had already started on “two”: His
spell hit Harry so hard he felt as though he’d been hit over the head with a
saucepan. He stumbled, but everything still seemed to be working, and
wasting no more time, Harry pointed his wand straight at Malfoy and shouted,
“Rictusempra!”A jet of silver light hit Malfoy in the stomach and he doubled up, wheezing.
“I said Disarm only!”
 Lockhart shouted in alarm over the heads of the
battling crowd,   briefly how the Death Eaters pursuing them had seemed to
recognize him as the true Harry, how they had abandoned the chase, how they
must have summoned Voldemort, who had appeared just before he and
Hagrid had reached the sanctuary of Tonks’s parents.
“They recognized you? But how? What had you done?”
“I . . .” Harry tried to remember; the whole journey seemed like a blur of
panic and confusion. “I saw Stan Shunpike. . . . You know, the bloke who was
the conductor on the Knight Bus? And I tried to Disarm him instead of —
well, he doesn’t know what he’s doing, does he? He must be Imperiused!”
Lupin looked aghast.
“Harry, the time for Disarming is past! These people are trying to capture
and kill you! At least Stun if you aren’t prepared to kill!”
“We were hundreds of feet up! Stan’s not himself, and if I Stunned him and
he’d fallen, he’d have died the same as if I’d used Avada Kedavra!
Expelliarmus saved me from Voldemort two years ago,” Harry added
defiantly. Lupin was reminding him of the sneering Hufflepuf , from which Harry retrieved it with a Summoning Charm.
Glancing around he thought he had been right to suggest that they practice the
basics first; there was a lot of shoddy spellwork going on; many people were
not succeeding in disarming their opponents at all, but merely causing them to
jump backward a few paces or wince as the feeble spell whooshed over them.“Expelliarmus!” 
said Neville, and Harry, caught unawares, felt his wand
fly out of his hand.
“I DID IT!” said Neville gleefully. “I’ve never done it before — I DID IT!”
“Good one!” said Harry encouragingly, deciding not to point out that in a
real duel situation Neville’s opponent was unlikely to be staring in the
opposite direction with his wand held loosely at his side. “Listen, Neville, can
you take it in turns to practice with Ron and Hermione for a couple of minutes
so I can walk around and see how the rest are doing?”
Harry moved off into the middle of the room. Something very odd was
happening to Zacharias Smith; every time he opened his mouth f Zacharias
Smith, who had jeered at Harry for wanting to teach Dumbledore’s Army how
to Disarm.
“Yes, Harry,” said Lupin with painful restraint, “and a great number of
Death Eaters witnessed that happening! Forgive me, but it was a very unusual
move then, under imminent threat of death. Repeating it tonight in front of
Death Eaters who either witnessed or heard about the first occasion was close
to suicidal!”
“So you think I should have killed Stan Shunpike?” said Harry angrily.
“Of course not,” said Lupin, “but the Death Eaters — frankly, most people!
— would have expected you to attack back! Expelliarmus is a useful spell,
Harry, but the Death Eaters seem to think it is your signature move, and I urgeyou not to let it become so!”
Lupin was making Harry feel idiotic, and yet there was still a grain of
defiance inside him.
“I won’t blast people out of my way just because they’re there,” said Harry.
“That’s Voldemort’s job.”
Lupin’s retort was lost: Finally succeeding in squeezing through the door,
Hagrid sta amusing was
Hermione, who maintained a rigidly disapproving expression throughout and
refused to talk at all if Harry had used the 
Muffliato
 spell on anyone in the
vicinity.
Sitting up in bed, Harry turned the book sideways so as to examine more
closely the scribbled instructions for a spell that seemed to have caused the
Prince some trouble. There were many crossings-out and alterations, but
finally, crammed into a corner of the page, the scribble:
Levicorpus (nvbl)
While the wind and sleet pounded relentlessly on the windows, and Neville
snored loudly, Harry stared at the letters in brackets. 
Nvbl . . . 
that had to
mean “nonverbal.” Harry rather doubted he would be able to bring off this
particular spell; he was still having difficulty with nonverbal spells,
something Snape had been quick to comment on in every D.A.D.A. class. On
the other hand, the Prince had proved a much more effective teacher than
Snape so far.
Pointing his wand at nothing in particular, he gave it an upward flick and
said 
Levicorp  to disarm
Anthony Goldstein, his own wand would fly out of his hand, yet Anthony did
not seem to be making a sound. Harry did not have to look far for the solution
of the mystery, however; Fred and George were several feet from Smith and
taking it in turns to point their wands at his back.
“Sorry, Harry,” said George hastily, when Harry caught his eye. “Couldn’t
resist . . .”
Harry walked around the other pairs, trying to correct those who were
doing the spell wrong. Ginny was teamed with Michael Corner; she was
doing very well, whereas Michael was either very bad or unwilling to jinx her.
Ernie Macmillan was flourishing his wand unnecessarily, giving his partner
time to get in under his guard; the Creevey brothers were enthusiastic but
erratic and mainly responsible for all the books leaping off the shelves around
them. Luna Lovegood was similarly patchy, occasionally sending Justin
Finch-Fletchley’s wand spinning out of his hand, at other times merely
causing his hair to stand on end.
“Okay, stop!” Harry s ntions. You know I
wouldn’t’ve used a spell like that, not even on Malfoy, but you can’t blame
the Prince, he hadn’t written ‘try this out, it’s really good’ — he was just
making notes for himself, wasn’t he, not for anyone else. . . .”
“Are you telling me,” said Hermione, “that you’re going to go back — ?”
“And get the book? Yeah, I am,” said Harry forcefully. “Listen, without the
Prince I’d never have won the Felix Felicis. I’d never have known how to
save Ron from poisoning, I’d never have —”
“— got a reputation for Potions brilliance you don’t deserve,” said
Hermione nastily.
“Give it a rest, Hermione!” said Ginny, and Harry was so amazed, so
grateful, he looked up. “By the sound of it, Malfoy was trying to use an
Unforgivable Curse, you should be glad Harry had something good up his
sleeve!”
“Well, of course I’m glad Harry wasn’t cursed!” said Hermione, clearly
stung. “But you can’t call that Sectumsempra spell good, Ginny, look where
it’s landed him! And I’d have thought, seeing what this has done to yo mmense strength
and the toughened skin he had inherited from his giantess mother seemed to
be protecting him. Snape and Malfoy, however, were still running; they would
soon be beyond the gates, able to Disapparate —
Harry tore past Hagrid and his opponent, took aim at Snape’s back, and
yelled, 
“Stupefy!”
He missed; the jet of red light soared past Snape’s head; Snape shouted,
“Run, Draco!”
 and turned. Twenty yards apart, he and Harry looked at each
other before raising their wands simultaneously.
“Cruc —”
But Snape parried the curse, knocking Harry backward off his feet before
he could complete it; Harry rolled over and scrambled back up again as the
huge Death Eater behind him yelled, 
“Incendio!”
 Harry heard an explosive
bang and a dancing orange light spilled over all of them: Hagrid’s house was
on fire.
“Fang’s in there, yer evil — !” Hagrid bellowed.
“Cruc —” 
yelled Harry for the second time, aiming for the figure ahead
illuminated in the dancing firelight, but Snape blocked the spell again. Harry

Madam Pomfrey would’ve done.”
“It looks as if it’s died,” said Hermione, with a nauseated expression. “But
there are some injuries you can’t cure . . . old curses . . . and there are poisons
without antidotes. . . .”
“. . . and Mr. Filch, our caretaker, has asked me to say that there is a blanket
ban on any joke items bought at the shop called Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes.
“Those wishing to play for their House Quidditch teams should give their
names to their Heads of House as usual. We are also looking for new
Quidditch commentators, who should do likewise.
“We are pleased to welcome a new member of staff this year. Professor
Slughorn” — Slughorn stood up, his bald head gleaming in the candlelight,
his big waistcoated belly casting the table below into shadow — “is a former
colleague of mine who has agreed to resume his old post of Potions master.”
“Potions?”
“Potions?”
The word echoed all over the Hall as people wondered whether they had
heard right.
“Potions?” said Ron and Hermione t “Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder he’s looking so
nervous, that’s Professor Snape. He teaches Potions, but he doesn’t want to —
everyone knows he’s after Quirrell’s job. Knows an awful lot about the Dark
Arts, Snape.”
Harry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn’t look at him again.
At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to his
feet again. The hall fell silent.
“Ahem — just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I
have a few start-of-term notices to give you.
“First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all
pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember that aswell.”
Dumbledore’s twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley twins.
“I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that
no magic should be used between classes in the corridors.
“Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone
interested in playing for their House teams should contact Mad inny,” said Ron, whose ears were now reddening.
“
You’re
 just worried I’m going to mess up your chances of being Head Boy
—”
“Five points from Gryffindor!” Percy said tersely, fingering his prefect
badge. “And I hope it teaches you a lesson! No more 
detective work,
 or I’ll
write to Mum!”
And he strode off, the back of his neck as red as Ron’s ears.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione chose seats as far as possible from Percy in the
common room that night. Ron was still in a very bad temper and kept blotting
his Charms homework. When he reached absently for his wand to remove the
smudges, it ignited the parchment. Fuming almost as much as his homework,
Ron slammed 
The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 2
 shut. To Harry’s surprise,
Hermione followed suit.
“Who can it be, though?” she said in a quiet voice, as though continuing a
conversation they had just been having. “Who’d 
want
 to frighten all the
Squibs and Muggle-borns out of Hogwarts?”
“Let’s think,” said Ron in mock puzzlement. “Who do we know who thinks
Muggle-b ille laughed gleefully.
“What did you do with the dragon?”
“Released it into the wild,” said Ron. “Hermione was all for keeping it as a
pet —”
“Don’t exaggerate, Ron —”
“But what have you been doing? People have been saying you’ve just been
on the run, Harry, but I don’t think so. I think you’ve been up to something.”
“You’re right,” said Harry, “but tell us about Hogwarts, Neville, we haven’theard anything.”
“It’s been . . . well, it’s not really like Hogwarts anymore,” said Neville, the
smile fading from his face as he spoke. “Do you know about the Carrows?”
“Those two Death Eaters who teach here?”
“They do more than teach,” said Neville. “They’re in charge of all
discipline. They like punishment, the Carrows.”
“Like Umbridge?”
“Nah, they make her look tame. The other teachers are all supposed to refer
us to the Carrows if we do anything wrong. They don’t, though, if they can
avoid it. You can tell they all hate them as much as we do.
“Amycus, the bloke, he teaches what used to be Defense Against the Dark
A em concerned with potion-making. Here
and there were directions for what looked like spells that the Prince had made
up himself.
“Or herself,” said Hermione irritably, overhearing Harry pointing some of
these out to Ron in the common room on Saturday evening. “It might have
been a girl. I think the handwriting looks more like a girl’s than a boy’s.”“The Half-Blood 
Prince,
 he was called,” Harry said. “How many girls have
been Princes?”
Hermione seemed to have no answer to this. She merely scowled and
twitched her essay on 
The Principles of Rematerialization
 away from Ron,
who was trying to read it upside down.
Harry looked at his watch and hurriedly put the old copy of 
Advanced
Potion-Making
 back into his bag.
“It’s five to eight, I’d better go, I’ll be late for Dumbledore.”
“Ooooh!” gasped Hermione, looking up at once. “Good luck! We’ll wait
up, we want to hear what he teaches you!”
“Hope it goes okay,” said Ron, and the pair of them watched Harry leave
through the portrait hole.
Harry proceeded through p of tea with me around three? I want to hear all about your
first week. Send us an answer back with Hedwig.
HagridHarry borrowed Ron’s quill, scribbled 
Yes, please, see you later
 on the back
of the note, and sent Hedwig off again.
It was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to, because the
Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so
far.
At the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the idea that Professor Snape
disliked him. By the end of the first Potions lesson, he knew he’d been wrong.
Snape didn’t dislike Harry — he 
hated
 him.
Potions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons. It was colder here
than up in the main castle, and would have been quite creepy enough without
the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls.
Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and like
Flitwick, he paused at Harry’s name.
“Ah, yes,” he said softly, “Harry Potter. Our new — 
celebrity
.”
Draco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and credulously
at Hermione. “No Quidditch practice and extra Potions?”
Harry slumped down into a chair, dragged his Potions essay reluctantly
from his bag, and set to work.
It was very hard to concentrate; even though he knew that Sirius was not
due in the fire until much later he could not help glancing into the flames
every few minutes just in case. There was also an incredible amount of noise
in the room: Fred and George appeared finally to have perfected one type of
Skiving Snackbox, which they were taking turns to demonstrate to a cheering
and whooping crowd.
First, Fred would take a bite out of the orange end of a chew, at which he
would vomit spectacularly into a bucket they had placed in front of them.
Then he would force down the purple end of the chew, at which the vomiting
would immediately cease. Lee Jordan, who was assisting the demonstration,
was lazily vanishing the vomit at regular intervals with the same Vanishing
Spell Snape kept using on Harry’s potions.
What with the regular sounds of retchin  how come these girls
are able to bring love potions into school?”
“Fred and George send them disguised as perfumes and cough potions,”
said Hermione. “It’s part of their Owl Order Service.”
“You know a lot about it.”
Hermione gave him the kind of nasty look she had just given his copy of
Advanced Potion-Making.
“It was all on the back of the bottles they showed Ginny and me in the
summer,” she said coldly. “I don’t go around putting potions in people’s
drinks . . . or pretending to, either, which is just as bad. . . .”
“Yeah, well, never mind that,” said Harry quickly. “The point is, Filch is
being fooled, isn’t he? These girls are getting stuff into the school disguised
as something else! So why couldn’t Malfoy have brought the necklace into
the school — ?”
“Oh, Harry . . . not that again . . .”
“Come on, why not?” demanded Harry.
“Look,” sighed Hermione, “Secrecy Sensors detect jinxes, curses, and
concealment charms, don’t they? They’re used to find Dark Magic and Dark
objects. They’d have picked up a powe"
What is the name of the Weasley's house?,The Burrow,"According to the context, the Weasley's house is not explicitly mentioned by name. However, it is implied that Mr. Weasley is referring to a secret he wants to share with Harry, which is likely related to the Weasley family.","rs of his name rearranged
themselves:
I AM LORD VOLDEMORT
“You see?” he whispered. “It was a name I was already using at Hogwarts,
to my most intimate friends only, of course. You think I was going to use my
filthy Muggle father’s name forever? I, in whose veins runs the blood of
Salazar Slytherin himself, through my mother’s side? I, keep the name of a
foul, common Muggle, who abandoned me even before I was born, just
because he found out his wife was a witch? No, Harry — I fashioned myself a
new name, a name I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak,when I had become the greatest sorcerer in the world!”
Harry’s brain seemed to have jammed. He stared numbly at Riddle, at the
orphaned boy who had grown up to murder Harry’s own parents, and so many
others. . . . At last he forced himself to speak.
“You’re not,” he said, his quiet voice full of hatred.
“Not what?” snapped Riddle.
“Not the greatest sorcerer in the world,” said Harry, breathing fast. “Sorry
to disappoint you and all that, but the grea  are, dear. . . .”
“Harry,” said Mr. Weasley quietly, “come over here a moment.”
He jerked his head toward a pillar, and Harry followed him behind it,
leaving the others crowded around Mrs. Weasley.“There’s something I’ve got to tell you before you leave —” said Mr.
Weasley, in a tense voice.
“It’s all right, Mr. Weasley,” said Harry. “I already know.”
“You know? How could you know?”
“I — er — I heard you and Mrs. Weasley talking last night. I couldn’t help
hearing,” Harry added quickly. “Sorry —”
“That’s not the way I’d have chosen for you to find out,” said Mr. Weasley,
looking anxious.
“No — honestly, it’s okay. This way, you haven’t broken your word to
Fudge and I know what’s going on.”
“Harry, you must be very scared —”
“I’m not,” said Harry sincerely. 
“Really,”
 he added, because Mr. Weasley
was looking disbelieving. “I’m not trying to be a hero, but seriously, Sirius
Black can’t be worse than Voldemort, can he?”
Mr. Weasley flinched at the sound of the name but overlooked it.
“Harry, I knew you were,  rom a doorway to the right — the
rest of the school must already be here — but Professor McGonagall showed
the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in,
standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering
about nervously.
“Welcome to Hogwarts,” said Professor McGonagall. “The start-of-term
banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall,
you will be sorted into your Houses. The Sorting is a very importantceremony because, while you are here, your House will be something like
your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your
House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free time in your House
common room.
“The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and
Slytherin. Each House has its own noble history and each has produced
outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs
will earn your House points, while any rule-breaking will lose House points.
At the end of the till
unable to account for the disappearance of one of its witches, the
Ministry was plunged into fresh embarrassment yesterday by the
antics of Arnold Weasley, of the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts
Office.”
Malfoy looked up.
“Imagine them not even getting his name right, Weasley. It’s almost as
though he’s a complete nonentity, isn’t it?” he crowed.
Everyone in the entrance hall was listening now. Malfoy straightened the
paper with a flourish and read on:
Arnold Weasley, who was charged with possession of a flying car
two years ago, was yesterday involved in a tussle with several
Muggle law-keepers (“policemen”) over a number of highly
aggressive dustbins. Mr. Weasley appears to have rushed to the aid
of “Mad-Eye” Moody, the aged ex-Auror who retired from the
Ministry when no longer able to tell the difference between a
handshake and attempted murder. Unsurprisingly, Mr. Weasley
found, upon arrival at Mr. Moody’s heavily guarded house, that Mr.Moody had once again raised a false alarm. Mr. Weasley was forced
to  than he 
needs to know,
 Molly,
” 
said Sirius.
“But as he was the one who saw Voldemort come back” (again, there was a
collective shudder around the table at the name), “he has more right than most
to —”
“He’s not a member of the Order of the Phoenix!” said Mrs. Weasley. “He’s
only fifteen and —”
“— and he’s dealt with as much as most in the Order,” said Sirius, “and
more than some —”
“No one’s denying what he’s done!” said Mrs. Weasley, her voice rising,
her fists trembling on the arms of her chair. “But he’s still —”
“He’s not a child!” said Sirius impatiently.
“He’s not an adult either!” said Mrs. Weasley, the color rising in her
cheeks. “He’s not 
James, 
Sirius!”
“I’m perfectly clear who he is, thanks, Molly,” said Sirius coldly.
“I’m not sure you are!” said Mrs. Weasley. “Sometimes, the way you talk
about him, it’s as though you think you’ve got your best friend back!”
“What’s wrong with that?” said Harry.
“What’s wrong, Harry, is that you are 
not
 your father, however much you
might look like him!” s  Slytherins all sing:
Weasley is our King.
 
Weasley was born in a bin,
He always lets the Quaffle in,
Weasley will make sure we win,
Weasley is our King.
 
“— and Alicia passes back to Angelina!” Lee shouted, and as Harry
swerved, his insides boiling at what he had just heard, he knew Lee was
trying to drown out the sound of the singing. “Come on now, Angelina —
looks like she’s got just the Keeper to beat! — SHE SHOOTS — SHE —
aaaah . . .”
Bletchley, the Slytherin Keeper, had saved the goal; he threw the Quaffle to
Warrington who sped off with it, zigzagging in between Alicia and Katie; the
singing from below grew louder and louder as he drew nearer and nearer Ron—
 
Weasley is our King,
Weasley is our King,
He always lets the Quaffle in,
Weasley is our King.
 
Harry could not help himself: Abandoning his search for the Snitch, he
turned his Firebolt toward Ron, a lone figure at the far end of the pitch,
hovering before the three goal hoops while the massive Warrington pelted
toward him . . .
“— and it’s Wa tly Mr. Weasley
was holding tight to it on the other side, because the door remained firmly
shut.
“Molly! I’ve got to ask you your question first!”
“Arthur, really, this is just silly. . . .”
“What do you like me to call you when we’re alone together?”
Even by the dim light of the lantern Harry could tell that Mrs. Weasley had
turned bright red; he himself felt suddenly warm around the ears and neck,
and hastily gulped soup, clattering his spoon as loudly as he could against the
bowl.
“Mollywobbles,” whispered a mortified Mrs. Weasley into the crack at the
edge of the door.“Correct,” said Mr. Weasley. “Now you can let me in.”
Mrs. Weasley opened the door to reveal her husband, a thin, balding, red-
haired wizard wearing horn-rimmed spectacles and a long and dusty traveling
cloak.
“I still don’t see why we have to go through that every time you come
home,” said Mrs. Weasley, still pink in the face as she helped her husband out
of his cloak. “I mean, a Death Eater might have forced the answer out of you
before  d everybody is, but every now and
then something really nasty turns up. The other day Arthur confiscated a box
of cursed Sneakoscopes that were almost certainly planted by a Death Eater.
So you see, it’s a very important job, and I tell him it’s just silly to miss
dealing with spark plugs and toasters and all the rest of that Muggle rubbish.”
Mrs. Weasley ended her speech with a stern look, as if it had been Harry
suggesting that it was natural to miss spark plugs.
“Is Mr. Weasley still at work?” Harry asked.
“Yes, he is. As a matter of fact, he’s a tiny bit late. . . . He said he’d be back
around midnight. . . .”
She turned to look at a large clock that was perched awkwardly on top of a
pile of sheets in the washing basket at the end of the table. Harry recognized it
at once: It had nine hands, each inscribed with the name of a family member,
and usually hung on the Weasleys’ sitting room wall, though its current
position suggested that Mrs. Weasley had taken to carrying it around the
house with her. Every s"

“Harry, come 
on
!”
Harry turned — Ron was hurriedly scooping up his miniature Krum — the
three of them started across the clearing — but before they had taken a few
hurried steps, a series of popping noises announced the arrival of twenty
wizards, appearing from thin air, surrounding them.
Harry whirled around, and in an instant, he registered one fact: Each of
these wizards had his wand out, and every wand was pointing right at himself,
Ron, and Hermione.
Without pausing to think, he yelled, “DUCK!”
He seized the other two and pulled them down onto the ground.
“STUPEFY!”
 roared twenty voices — there was a blinding series of
flashes and Harry felt the hair on his head ripple as though a powerful wind
had swept the clearing. Raising his head a fraction of an inch he saw jets of
fiery red light flying over them from the wizards’ wands, crossing one
another, bouncing off tree trunks, rebounding into the darkness —
“Stop!” yelled a voice he recognized. “STOP! 
That’s my son!
” at were they after, do you think?”
“Information on the Order, if it was Snape.”
“But you’d think he’d already have all he needed, I mean, he was 
in 
the
Order, wasn’t he?”
“Well then,” said Harry, keen to discuss his theory, “what about
information on Dumbledore? The second page of this letter, for instance. You
know this Bathilda my mum mentions, you know who she is?”
“Who?”
“Bathilda Bagshot, the author of —”
“
A History of Magic,
” said Hermione, looking interested. “So your parents
knew her? She was an incredible magical historian.”
“And she’s still alive,” said Harry, “and she lives in Godric’s Hollow, Ron’s
Auntie Muriel was talking about her at the wedding. She knew Dumbledore’s
family too. Be pretty interesting to talk to, wouldn’t she?”
There was a little too much understanding in the smile Hermione gave him
for Harry’s liking. He took back the letter and the photograph and tucked
them inside the pouch around his neck, so as not to have to look at her and
give himself away.
“I understand why you’d l . Again, your readers will have to buy my book for the
whole story, but there is no question that Dumbledore took an unnatural
interest in Potter from the word go. Whether that was really in the boy’s
best interests — well, we’ll see. It’s certainly an open secret that Potter
has had a most troubled adolescence.”
I ask whether Skeeter is still in touch with Harry Potter, whom she so
famously interviewed last year: a breakthrough piece in which Potter
spoke exclusively of his conviction that You-Know-Who had returned.
“Oh, yes, we’ve developed a close bond,” says Skeeter. “Poor Potter
has few real friends, and we met at one of the most testing moments of
his life — the Triwizard Tournament. I am probably one of the only
people alive who can say that they know the real Harry Potter.”
Which leads us neatly to the many rumors still circulating about
Dumbledore’s final hours. Does Skeeter believe that Potter was there
when Dumbledore died?
“Well, I don’t want to say too much — it’s all in the book — but
eyewitness f them. “Trying to pretend it hasn’t happened?”
“Get out,” said Harry.He had not been this close to Malfoy since he had watched him muttering
to Crabbe and Goyle during Dumbledore’s speech about Cedric. He could feel
a kind of ringing in his ears. His hand gripped his wand under his robes.
“You’ve picked the losing side, Potter! I warned you! I told you you ought
to choose your company more carefully, remember? When we met on the
train, first day at Hogwarts? I told you not to hang around with riffraff like
this!” He jerked his head at Ron and Hermione. “Too late now, Potter! They’ll
be the first to go, now the Dark Lord’s back! Mudbloods and Muggle-lovers
first! Well — second — Diggory was the f —”
It was as though someone had exploded a box of fireworks within the
compartment. Blinded by the blaze of the spells that had blasted from every
direction, deafened by a series of bangs, Harry blinked and looked down at
the floor.
Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle were all lying unconscious in the doorway. He,
Ron, and Her ut was not at all surprised that the locket was not
there. He gave the office one last sweeping look, and his heart skipped a beat.
Dumbledore was staring at him from a small rectangular mirror, propped up
on a bookcase beside the desk.
Harry crossed the room at a run and snatched it up, but realized the moment
he touched it that it was not a mirror at all. Dumbledore was smiling wistfully
out of the front cover of a glossy book. Harry had not immediately noticed the
curly green writing across his hat — 
The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore
— nor the slightly smaller writing across his chest: “by Rita Skeeter,
bestselling author of 
Armando Dippet: Master or Moron?
”
Harry opened the book at random and saw a full-page photograph of two
teenage boys, both laughing immoderately with their arms around each
other’s shoulders. Dumbledore, now with elbow-length hair, had grown a tiny
wispy beard that recalled the one on Krum’s chin that had so annoyed Ron.
The boy who roared in silent amusement beside Dumbledore h ewolf attacks.”
The bell rang and Lockhart got to his feet.“Homework — compose a poem about my defeat of the Wagga Wagga
Werewolf! Signed copies of 
Magical Me
 to the author of the best one!”
The class began to leave. Harry returned to the back of the room, where
Ron and Hermione were waiting.
“Ready?” Harry muttered.
“Wait till everyone’s gone,” said Hermione nervously. “All right . . .”
She approached Lockhart’s desk, a piece of paper clutched tightly in her
hand, Harry and Ron right behind her.
“Er — Professor Lockhart?” Hermione stammered. “I wanted to — to get
this book out of the library. Just for background reading.” She held out the
piece of paper, her hand shaking slightly. “But the thing is, it’s in the
Restricted Section of the library, so I need a teacher to sign for it — I’m sure
it would help me understand what you say in 
Gadding with Ghouls
 about
slow-acting venoms —”
“Ah, 
Gadding with Ghouls
!” said Lockhart, taking the note from Hermione
and smiling widely at her. “Possibly my very favori one while he travels.”
“We are at an advantage there, my Lord,” said Yaxley, who seemed
determined to receive some portion of approval. “We now have several people
planted within the Department of Magical Transport. If Potter Apparates or
uses the Floo Network, we shall know immediately.”
“He will not do either,” said Snape. “The Order is eschewing any form of
transport that is controlled or regulated by the Ministry; they mistrust
everything to do with the place.”
“All the better,” said Voldemort. “He will have to move in the open. Easier
to take, by far.”
Again, Voldemort looked up at the slowly revolving body as he went on, “I
shall attend to the boy in person. There have been too many mistakes where
Harry Potter is concerned. Some of them have been my own. That Potter lives
is due more to my errors than to his triumphs.”
The company around the table watched Voldemort apprehensively, each of
them, by his or her expression, afraid that they might be blamed for Harry
Potter’s continued existence. Voldemort, "
What platform do students use to board the Hogwarts Express?,Platform 9 3/4,The students use Platform 9 3/4 to board the Hogwarts Express.,"ough onto
platform nine and three quarters, where the Hogwarts Express stood belching
sooty steam over a platform packed with departing students and their families.Harry inhaled the familiar smell and felt his spirits soar. . . . He was really
going back. . . .
“I hope the others make it in time,” said Mrs. Weasley anxiously, staring
behind her at the wrought-iron arch spanning the platform, through which
new arrivals would come.
“Nice dog, Harry!” called a tall boy with dreadlocks.
“Thanks, Lee,” said Harry, grinning, as Sirius wagged his tail frantically.
“Oh good,” said Mrs. Weasley, sounding relieved, “here’s Alastor with the
luggage, look . . .”
A porter’s cap pulled low over his mismatched eyes, Moody came limping
through the archway pushing a cart full of their trunks.
“All okay,” he muttered to Mrs. Weasley and Tonks. “Don’t think we were
followed . . .”
Seconds later, Mr. Weasley emerged onto the platform with Ron and
Hermione. They had almost unloaded Moody’s luggage cart when Fred,
George, and Ginn  ten. The only tricky part was doing this in an
unobtrusive way, so as to avoid attracting Muggle attention. They did it in
groups today; Harry, Ron, and Hermione (the most conspicuous, since they
were accompanied by Pigwidgeon and Crookshanks) went first; they leaned
casually against the barrier, chatting unconcernedly, and slid sideways
through it . . . and as they did so, platform nine and three-quarters
materialized in front of them.
The Hogwarts Express, a gleaming scarlet steam engine, was already there,
clouds of steam billowing from it, through which the many Hogwarts students
and parents on the platform appeared like dark ghosts. Pigwidgeon became
noisier than ever in response to the hooting of many owls through the mist.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione set off to find seats, and were soon stowing their
luggage in a compartment halfway along the train. They then hopped back
down onto the platform to say good-bye to Mrs. Weasley, Bill, and Charlie.
“I might be seeing you all sooner than you think,” said Char 
It didn’t come . . . he kept on running . . . he opened his eyes.
A scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people.
A sign overhead said Hogwarts Express, eleven o’clock. Harry looked behind
him and saw a wrought-iron archway where the barrier had been, with the
words 
Platform Nine and Three-Quarters
 on it. He had done it.
Smoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd,while cats of every color wound here and there between their legs. Owls
hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and the
scraping of heavy trunks.
The first few carriages were already packed with students, some hanging
out of the window to talk to their families, some fighting over seats. Harry
pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seat. He passed a
round-faced boy who was saying, “Gran, I’ve lost my toad again.”
“Oh, 
Neville,
” he heard the old woman sigh.
A boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd.
“Give us a look, Lee, go on.”
The boy up for his abysmal Potions
one. They had hoped that Goyle, who was almost as stupid as he was mean,
might be thrown out, but he had passed, too. It was a shame, but as Ron said,
you couldn’t have everything in life.
And suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their trunks were packed,
Neville’s toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets; notes were handed
out to all students, warning them not to use magic over the holidays (“I
always hope they’ll forget to give us these,” said Fred Weasley sadly); Hagrid
was there to take them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across the lake;
they were boarding the Hogwarts Express; talking and laughing as the
countryside became greener and tidier; eating Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor
Beans as they sped past Muggle towns; pulling off their wizard robes and
putting on jackets and coats; pulling into platform nine and three-quarters at
King’s Cross station.
It took quite a while for them all to get off the platform. A wizened old
guard was up by the ticket barrier, lett jeans because he didn’t want
to walk into the station in his wizard’s robes — he’d change on the train. He
checked his Hogwarts list yet again to make sure he had everything he
needed, saw that Hedwig was shut safely in her cage, and then paced the
room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up. Two hours later, Harry’s huge, heavy
trunk had been loaded into the Dursleys’ car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley
into sitting next to Harry, and they had set off.
They reached King’s Cross at half past ten. Uncle Vernon dumped Harry’s
trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him. Harry thought this
was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, facing the platforms
with a nasty grin on his face.
“Well, there you are, boy. Platform nine — platform ten. Your platform
should be somewhere in the middle, but they don’t seem to have built it yet,
do they?”
He was quite right, of course. There was a big plastic number nine over one
platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it, and in the
middle, eys,
unloaded their trunks, touched their hats in salute to Mr. Weasley, and drove
away, somehow managing to jump to the head of an unmoving line at the
traffic lights.Mr. Weasley kept close to Harry’s elbow all the way into the station.
“Right then,” he said, glancing around them. “Let’s do this in pairs, as there
are so many of us. I’ll go through first with Harry.”
Mr. Weasley strolled toward the barrier between platforms nine and ten,
pushing Harry’s trolley and apparently very interested in the InterCity 125
that had just arrived at platform nine. With a meaningful look at Harry, he
leaned casually against the barrier. Harry imitated him.
In a moment, they had fallen sideways through the solid metal onto
platform nine and three-quarters and looked up to see the Hogwarts Express, a
scarlet steam engine, puffing smoke over a platform packed with witches and
wizards seeing their children onto the train.
Percy and Ginny suddenly appeared behind Harry. They were panting and
had apparently taken the barrier at to a run.
A moment later, he had vanished.
“You’ll write to me, won’t you?” Albus asked his parents immediately,
capitalizing on the momentary absence of his brother.
“Every day, if you want us to,” said Ginny.
“Not 
every 
day,” said Albus quickly. “James says most people only get
letters from home about once a month.”
“We wrote to James three times a week last year,” said Ginny.
“And you don’t want to believe everything he tells you about Hogwarts,”
Harry put in. “He likes a laugh, your brother.”
Side by side, they pushed the second trolley forward, gathering speed. As
they reached the barrier, Albus winced, but no collision came. Instead, the
family emerged onto platform nine and three-quarters, which was obscured by
thick white steam that was pouring from the scarlet Hogwarts Express.
Indistinct figures were swarming through the mist, into which James had
already disappeared.
“Where are they?” asked Albus anxiously, peering at the hazy forms they
passed as they made their way down the platform.
“We’ll fin not offended,” said Harry quickly. “Just tell us what to do.”
“Well, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and Hermione, you go there
instead of that castle.”
“What about you?”
“I’m going to be a knight,” said Ron.
The chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these words a
knight, a bishop, and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces and
walked off the board, leaving three empty squares that Harry, Ron, and
Hermione took.
“White always plays first in chess,” said Ron, peering across the board.
“Yes . . . look . . .”
A white pawn had moved forward two squares.
Ron started to direct the black pieces. They moved silently wherever he
sent them. Harry’s knees were trembling. What if they lost?
“Harry — move diagonally four squares to the right.”
Their first real shock came when their other knight was taken. The white
queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board, where he lay
quite still, facedown.
“Had to let that happen,” said Ron, looking shaken. “Leaves you free to
take tha"
What is the name of Harry's godfather?,Sirius Black,The name of Harry's godfather is Sirius Black.," Harry bid him
and Hermione good-bye, then wheeled the trolley bearing his trunk and
Hedwig’s cage toward Uncle Vernon, who greeted him in his usual fashion.
“What’s that?” he snarled, staring at the envelope Harry was still clutching
in his hand. “If it’s another form for me to sign, you’ve got another —”
“It’s not,” said Harry cheerfully. “It’s a letter from my godfather.”
“Godfather?” spluttered Uncle Vernon. “You haven’t got a godfather!”
“Yes, I have,” said Harry brightly. “He was my mum and dad’s best friend.
He’s a convicted murderer, but he’s broken out of Wizard prison and he’s on
the run. He likes to keep in touch with me, though . . . keep up with my
news . . . check if I’m happy. . . .”
And, grinning broadly at the look of horror on Uncle Vernon’s face, Harry
set off toward the station exit, Hedwig rattling along in front of him, for what
looked like a much better summer than the last.

Interior illus rs of his name rearranged
themselves:
I AM LORD VOLDEMORT
“You see?” he whispered. “It was a name I was already using at Hogwarts,
to my most intimate friends only, of course. You think I was going to use my
filthy Muggle father’s name forever? I, in whose veins runs the blood of
Salazar Slytherin himself, through my mother’s side? I, keep the name of a
foul, common Muggle, who abandoned me even before I was born, just
because he found out his wife was a witch? No, Harry — I fashioned myself a
new name, a name I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak,when I had become the greatest sorcerer in the world!”
Harry’s brain seemed to have jammed. He stared numbly at Riddle, at the
orphaned boy who had grown up to murder Harry’s own parents, and so many
others. . . . At last he forced himself to speak.
“You’re not,” he said, his quiet voice full of hatred.
“Not what?” snapped Riddle.
“Not the greatest sorcerer in the world,” said Harry, breathing fast. “Sorry
to disappoint you and all that, but the grea for me. I used your
name but told them to take the gold from Gringotts vault number seven
hundred and eleven — my own. Please consider it as thirteen birthdays’
worth of presents from your godfather.
I would also like to apologize for the fright I think I gave you that
night last year when you left your uncle’s house. I had only hoped to get
a glimpse of you before starting my journey north, but I think the sight of
me alarmed you.
I am enclosing something else for you, which I think will make your
next year at Hogwarts more enjoyable.
If ever you need me, send word. Your owl will find me.
I’ll write again soon.
Sirius
Harry looked eagerly inside the envelope. There was another piece of
parchment in there. He read it through quickly and felt suddenly as warm and
contented as though he’d swallowed a bottle of hot butterbeer in one gulp.
I, Sirius Black, Harry Potter’s godfather, hereby give him permission to
visit Hogsmeade on weekends.
“That’ll be good enough for Dumbledore!” said Harry happily. He looked
bac s so raw and fresh inside, he could not
muster any great sense of fear. It was sunny and the grounds around him were
full of laughing people, and even though he felt as distant from them as
though he belonged to a different race, it was still very hard to believe as he
sat here that his life must include, or end in, murder. . . .
He sat there for a long time, gazing out at the water, trying not to think
about his godfather or to remember that it was directly across from here, on
the opposite bank, that Sirius had collapsed trying to fend off a hundred
dementors. . . .
The sun had fallen before he realized that he was cold. He got up and
returned to the castle, wiping his face on his sleeve as he went.
Ron and Hermione left the hospital wing completely cured three days before
the end of term. Hermione showed signs of wanting to talk about Sirius, but
Ron tended to make hushing noises every time she mentioned his name.
Harry was not sure whether or not he wanted to talk about his godfather yet;
his wishes varie  he owned.”
Over on the sofa, Uncle Vernon’s head turned, but Harry did not look at
him, nor could he think of anything to say except, “Oh. Right.”
“This is, in the main, fairly straightforward,” Dumbledore went on. “You
add a reasonable amount of gold to your account at Gringotts, and you inherit
all of Sirius’s personal possessions. The slightly problematic part of the
legacy —”
“His godfather’s dead?” said Uncle Vernon loudly from the sofa.
Dumbledore and Harry both turned to look at him. The glass of mead was
now knocking quite insistently on the side of Vernon’s head; he attempted to
beat it away. “He’s dead? His godfather?”
“Yes,” said Dumbledore. He did not ask Harry why he had not confided in
the Dursleys. “Our problem,” he continued to Harry, as if there had been no
interruption, “is that Sirius also left you number twelve, Grimmauld Place.”
“He’s been left a house?” said Uncle Vernon greedily, his small eyes
narrowing, but nobody answered him.
“You can keep using it as headquarters,” said Harry. “I  an old badge that

 and 
POTTER STINKS,
a cracked and worn-out Sneakoscope, and a gold locket inside which a note
signed R.A.B. had been hidden, he finally discovered the sharp edge that had
done the damage. He recognized it at once. It was a two-inch-long fragment
of the enchanted mirror that his dead godfather, Sirius, had given him. Harry
laid it aside and felt cautiously around the trunk for the rest, but nothing more
remained of his godfather’s last gift except powdered glass, which clung to
the deepest layer of debris like glittering grit.
Harry sat up and examined the jagged piece on which he had cut himself,
seeing nothing but his own bright green eye reflected back at him. Then he
placed the fragment on top of that morning’s 
Daily Prophet, 
which lay unread
on the bed, and attempted to stem the sudden upsurge of bitter memories, the
stabs of regret and of longing the discovery of the broken mirror had
occasioned, by attacking the rest of the rubbish  e getting
to the bottom of this business. He had moved forward in his chair so that,
without realizing it, he was perched on the very edge, tense as though poised
for flight.
“How come I saw through the snake’s eyes if it’s Voldemort’s thoughts I’m
sharing?”
“Do not say the Dark Lord’s name!” 
spat Snape.
There was a nasty silence. They glared at each other across the Pensieve.
“Professor Dumbledore says his name,” said Harry quietly.
“Dumbledore is an extremely powerful wizard,” Snape muttered. “While
he 
may feel secure enough to use the name . . . the rest of us . . .” He rubbed
his left forearm, apparently unconsciously, on the spot where Harry knew the
Dark Mark was burned into his skin.
“I just wanted to know,” Harry began again, forcing his voice back to
politeness, “why —”
“You seem to have visited the snake’s mind because that was where the
Dark Lord was at that particular moment,” snarled Snape. “He was possessingthe snake at the time and so you dreamed you were inside it too . . .”
“And Vol — he —  ius; it had been painful enough to hear Uncle
Vernon say “His godfather’s dead?” and even worse to hear Sirius’s name
thrown out casually by Slughorn.
“It was cruel,” said Dumbledore softly, “that you and Sirius had such a
short time together. A brutal ending to what should have been a long and
happy relationship.”
Harry nodded, his eyes fixed resolutely on the spider now climbing
Dumbledore’s hat. He could tell that Dumbledore understood, that he might
even suspect that until his letter arrived, Harry had spent nearly all his time at
the Dursleys’ lying on his bed, refusing meals, and staring at the misted
window, full of the chill emptiness that he had come to associate with
dementors.“It’s just hard,” Harry said finally, in a low voice, “to realize he won’t write
to me again.”
His eyes burned suddenly and he blinked. He felt stupid for admitting it,
but the fact that he had had someone outside Hogwarts who cared what
happened to him, almost like a parent, had been one of the best things about

DUMBLEDORE’S GIANT MISTAKE
Albus Dumbledore, eccentric headmaster of Hogwarts School of
Witchcraft and Wizardry, has never been afraid to make
controversial staff appointments, 
writes Rita Skeeter, Special
Correspondent.
 In September of this year, he hired Alastor “Mad-
Eye” Moody, the notoriously jinx-happy ex-Auror, to teach Defense
Against the Dark Arts, a decision that caused many raised eyebrows
at the Ministry of Magic, given Moody’s well-known habit of
attacking anybody who makes a sudden movement in his presence.
Mad-Eye Moody, however, looks responsible and kindly when set
beside the part-human Dumbledore employs to teach Care ofMagical Creatures.
Rubeus Hagrid, who admits to being expelled from Hogwarts in
his third year, has enjoyed the position of gamekeeper at the school
ever since, a job secured for him by Dumbledore. Last year,
ho ather says it’s a crime if I’m not picked to play for my House,
and I must say, I agree. Know what House you’ll be in yet?”
“No,” said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute.
“Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know I’ll be
in Slytherin, all our family have been — imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think
I’d leave, wouldn’t you?”
“Mmm,” said Harry, wishing he could say something a bit more interesting.
“I say, look at that man!” said the boy suddenly, nodding toward the front
window. Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two
large ice creams to show he couldn’t come in.
“That’s Hagrid,” said Harry, pleased to know something the boy didn’t.
“He works at Hogwarts.”
“Oh,” said the boy, “I’ve heard of him. He’s a sort of servant, isn’t he?”
“He’s the gamekeeper,” said Harry. He was liking the boy less and less
every second.
“Yes, exactly. I heard he’s a sort of 
savage
 — lives in a hut on the school
grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic,  h for Dumbledore, it ought
to be good enough for the Ministry, though now he came to think of it, he was
not sure the Ministry knew about his Cloak.
“Here you are, then,” said the driver, a surprisingly short while later,
speaking for the first time as he slowed in Charing Cross Road and stopped
outside the Leaky Cauldron. “I’m to wait for you, any idea how long you’ll
be?”
“A couple of hours, I expect,” said Mr. Weasley. “Ah, good, he’s here!”
Harry imitated Mr. Weasley and peered through the window; his heart
leapt. There were no Aurors waiting outside the inn, but instead the gigantic,
black-bearded form of Rubeus Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper, wearing a
long beaverskin coat, beaming at the sight of Harry’s face and oblivious to the
startled stares of passing Muggles.“Harry!” he boomed, sweeping Harry into a bone-crushing hug the moment
Harry had stepped out of the car. “Buckbeak — Witherwings, I mean — yeh
should see him, Harry, he’s so happy ter be back in the open air —”
“Glad he’s pleased,” said Harr s me mum . . . well,
anyway. ’Course, I never was great shakes at magic, really . . . but at least he
never saw me expelled. Died, see, in me second year. . . .
“Dumbledore was the one who stuck up for me after Dad went. Got me the
gamekeeper job . . . trusts people, he does. Gives ’em second chances . . .
tha’s what sets him apar’ from other Heads, see. He’ll accept anyone at
Hogwarts, s’long as they’ve got the talent. Knows people can turn out okay

understand that. There’s some who’d always hold it against yeh . . . there’s
some who’d even pretend they just had big bones rather than stand up an’ say

ter say, ‘there’s some who’ll hold it against you, but they’re not worth
botherin’ with.’ An’ he was right. I’ve bin an idiot. I’m not botherin’ with 
her
no more, I promise yeh that. Big bones . . . I’ll give her big bones.”Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked   be like . . . proper creatures
like unicorns, not monsters. . . .”
“What about Hagrid?” Harry said angrily as they went up the steps.
“What about him?” said Parvati in a hard voice. “He can still be
gamekeeper, can’t he?”
Parvati had been very cool toward Harry since the ball. He supposed that
he ought to have paid her a bit more attention, but she seemed to have had a
good time all the same. She was certainly telling anybody who would listen
that she had made arrangements to meet the boy from Beauxbatons in
Hogsmeade on the next weekend trip.
“That was a really good lesson,” said Hermione as they entered the Great
Hall. “I didn’t know half the things Professor Grubbly-Plank told us about uni
—”
“Look at this!” Harry snarled, and he shoved the 
Daily Prophet
 article
under Hermione’s nose.
Hermione’s mouth fell open as she read. Her reaction was exactly the same
as Ron’s.
“How did that horrible Skeeter woman find out? You don’t think Hagrid
told
 her?”
“No,” said Harry, leading the way over to the Gryffindor , and Pettigrew had vanished except Harry, Ron, Hermione,
and Professor Dumbledore. As the end of term approached, Harry heard many
different theories about what had really happened, but none of them came
close to the truth.
Malfoy was furious about Buckbeak. He was convinced that Hagrid had
found a way of smuggling the hippogriff to safety, and seemed outraged that
he and his father had been outwitted by a gamekeeper. Percy Weasley,
meanwhile, had much to say on the subject of Sirius’s escape.
“If I manage to get into the Ministry, I’ll have a lot of proposals to make
about Magical Law Enforcement!” he told the only person who would listen
— his girlfriend, Penelope.
Though the weather was perfect, though the atmosphere was so cheerful,
though he knew they had achieved the near impossible in helping Sirius to
freedom, Harry had never approached the end of a school year in worse
spirits.
He certainly wasn’t the only one who was sorry to see Professor Lupin go.
The whole of Harry’s Defense Against the Dark Art st
Christmas he’d ever had. Ron and his brothers were staying, too, because Mr.
and Mrs. Weasley were going to Romania to visit Charlie.
When they left the dungeons at the end of Potions, they found a large fir
tree blocking the corridor ahead. Two enormous feet sticking out at the
bottom and a loud puffing sound told them that Hagrid was behind it.
“Hi, Hagrid, want any help?” Ron asked, sticking his head through the
branches.
“Nah, I’m all right, thanks, Ron.”
“Would you mind moving out of the way?” came Malfoy’s cold drawl from
behind them. “Are you trying to earn some extra money, Weasley? Hoping to
be gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts, I suppose — that hut of
Hagrid’s must seem like a palace compared to what your family’s used to.”
Ron dived at Malfoy just as Snape came up the stairs.
“WEASLEY!”
Ron let go of the front of Malfoy’s robes.
“He was provoked, Professor Snape,” said Hagrid, sticking his huge hairy
face out from behind the tree. “Malfoy was insultin’ his family.”
“Be that as it may, "
What position does Harry play on his Quidditch team?,Seeker,"According to the context, Harry plays the position of Seeker on the Gryffindor Quidditch team.","you’ll understand
why I don’t think it’s a good idea for you to be practicing Quidditch in the
evenings. Out on the field with only your team members, it’s very exposed,
Potter —”
“We’ve got our first match on Saturday!” said Harry, outraged. “I’ve got to
train, Professor!”
Professor McGonagall considered him intently. Harry knew she was deeply
interested in the Gryffindor team’s prospects; it had been she, after all, who’d
suggested him as Seeker in the first place. He waited, holding his breath.
“Hmm . . .” Professor McGonagall stood up and stared out of the windowat the Quidditch field, just visible through the rain. “Well . . . goodness
knows, I’d like to see us win the Cup at last . . . but all the same, Potter . . . I’d
be happier if a teacher were present. I’ll ask Madam Hooch to oversee your
training sessions.”
The weather worsened steadily as the first Quidditch match drew nearer.
Undaunted, the Gryffindor team was training harder than ever under the eye
of Madam Hooch. Then, at their final training  king for
any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor!”
George Weasley really did fall off his broom at these words.
“
Snape’s
 refereeing?” he spluttered through a mouthful of mud. “When’s he
ever refereed a Quidditch match? He’s not going to be fair if we might
overtake Slytherin.”
The rest of the team landed next to George to complain, too.
“It’s not 
my
 fault,” said Wood. “We’ve just got to make sure we play a
clean game, so Snape hasn’t got an excuse to pick on us.”
Which was all very well, thought Harry, but he had another reason for not
wanting Snape near him while he was playing Quidditch. . . .
The rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of
practice, but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common room,
where he found Ron and Hermione playing chess. Chess was the only thing
Hermione ever lost at, something Harry and Ron thought was very good for
her.
“Don’t talk to me for a moment,” said Ron when Harry sat down next to
him, “I need to concen —” He caught sight of H r
just sent it. . . . Ah yes . . .”
She had pulled out a piece of parchment that she now unfurled, clearing her
throat fussily before starting to read what it said.
“
Hem, hem . . . 
‘Educational Decree Number Twenty-five . . .’”
“Not another one!” exclaimed Professor McGonagall violently.
“Well, yes,” said Umbridge, still smiling. “As a matter of fact, Minerva, it
was you who made me see that we 
needed 
a further amendment. . . . You
remember how you overrode me, when I was unwilling to allow the
Gryffindor Quidditch team to re-form? How you took the case to
Dumbledore, who insisted that the team be allowed to play? Well, now, I
couldn’t have that. I contacted the Minister at once, and he quite agreed with
me that the High Inquisitor has to have the power to strip pupils of privileges,
or she — that is to say, I — would have less authority than common teachers!
And you see now, don’t you, Minerva, how right I was in attempting to stop
the Gryffindor team re-forming? 
Dreadful
 tempers . . . Anyway, I was re uidditch match against
Hufflepuff, for many of them wanted to see Zacharias Smith, who played
Chaser on the Hufflepuff team, punished soundly for his commentary during
the opening match against Slytherin.
Harry, however, had never been less interested in Quidditch; he was rapidly
becoming obsessed with Draco Malfoy. Still checking the Marauder’s Map
whenever he got a chance, he sometimes made detours to wherever Malfoy
happened to be, but had not yet detected him doing anything out of the
ordinary. And still there were those inexplicable times when Malfoy simply
vanished from the map. . . .
But Harry did not get a lot of time to consider the problem, what with
Quidditch practice, homework, and the fact that he was now being dogged
wherever he went by Cormac McLaggen and Lavender Brown.
He could not decide which of them was more annoying. McLaggen kept up
a constant stream of hints that he would make a better permanent Keeper for
the team than Ron, and that now that Harry was seeing him play regularly he
would ture, so I’d recommend Divination. People say Muggle
Studies is a soft option, but I personally think wizards should have a thorough
understanding of the non-magical community, particularly if they’re thinking
of working in close contact with them — look at my father, he has to deal
with Muggle business all the time. My brother Charlie was always more of an
outdoor type, so he went for Care of Magical Creatures. Play to your
strengths, Harry.”
But the only thing Harry felt he was really good at was Quidditch. In the
end, he chose the same new subjects as Ron, feeling that if he was lousy at
them, at least he’d have someone friendly to help him.Gryffindor’s next Quidditch match would be against Hufflepuff. Wood was
insisting on team practices every night after dinner, so that Harry barely had
time for anything but Quidditch and homework. However, the training
sessions were getting better, or at least drier, and the evening before
Saturday’s match he went up to his dormitory to drop off his broomstick
feeling G , gesturing him
to the ground. The whole team splashed down into the mud.
“I called for time-out!” Wood roared at his team. “Come on, under here —”
They huddled at the edge of the field under a large umbrella; Harry took off
his glasses and wiped them hurriedly on his robes.
“What’s the score?”
“We’re fifty points up,” said Wood, “but unless we get the Snitch soon,
we’ll be playing into the night.”
“I’ve got no chance with these on,” Harry said exasperatedly, waving his
glasses.
At that very moment, Hermione appeared at his shoulder; she was holding
her cloak over her head and was, inexplicably, beaming.
“I’ve had an idea, Harry! Give me your glasses, quick!”
He handed them to her, and as the team watched in amazement, Hermione
tapped them with her wand and said, 
“Impervius!”
“There!” she said, handing them back to Harry. “They’ll repel water!”
Wood looked as though he could have kissed her.
“Brilliant!” he called hoarsely after her as she disappeared into the crowd.
“Okay, team, let’s go for it!”Hermione’s  r heads.
“I’m sorry,” Ron mumbled, looking at his feet.
“What for?” said Harry.
“For thinking I can play Quidditch,” said Ron. “I’m going to resign first
thing tomorrow.”
“If you resign,” said Harry testily, “there’ll only be three players left on the
team.” And when Ron looked puzzled, he said, “I’ve been given a lifetime
ban. So’ve Fred and George.”“What?” Ron yelped.
Hermione told him the full story; Harry could not bear to tell it again.
When she had finished, Ron looked more anguished than ever.
“This is all my fault —”
“You didn’t 
make
 me punch Malfoy,” said Harry angrily.
“— if I wasn’t so lousy at Quidditch —”
“— it’s got nothing to do with that —”
“— it was that song that wound me up —”
“— it would’ve wound anyone up —”
Hermione got up and walked to the window, away from the argument,
watching the snow swirling down against the pane.
“Look, drop it, will you!” Harry burst out. “It’s bad enough without you
blaming yourself for everything!”
Ron said nothing but sat gazing miserably at the damp hem of Harry fiercely, seizing
Ron by the front of his robes. “You can save anything when you’re on form,
it’s a mental problem you’ve got!”
“You calling me mental?”
“Yeah, maybe I am!”
They glared at each other for a moment, then Ron shook his head wearily.
“I know you haven’t got any time to find another Keeper, so I’ll play
tomorrow, but if we lose, and we will, I’m taking myself off the team.”
Nothing Harry said made any difference. He tried boosting Ron’s
confidence all through dinner, but Ron was too busy being grumpy and surly
with Hermione to notice. Harry persisted in the common room that evening,
but his assertion that the whole team would be devastated if Ron left was
somewhat undermined by the fact that the rest of the team was sitting in a
huddle in a distant corner, clearly muttering about Ron and casting him nasty
looks. Finally Harry tried getting angry again in the hope of provoking Ron
into a defiant, and hopefully goal-saving, attitude, but this strategy did not
appear to work any better than enco"
Who is the ghost of Gryffindor House?,Nearly Headless Nick,The ghost of Gryffindor House is Nearly Headless Nick.,"ching the
bottom of the stairs, where Nearly Headless Nick, ghost of Gryffindor Tower,
stood waiting for him.
“Harry! My dear boy!”Nick made to grasp Harry’s hands with both of his own: Harry’s felt as
though they had been thrust into icy water.
“Nick, you’ve got to help me. Who’s the ghost of Ravenclaw Tower?”
Nearly Headless Nick looked surprised and a little offended.
“The Gray Lady, of course; but if it is ghostly services you require — ?”
“It’s got to be her — d’you know where she is?”
“Let’s see. . . .”
Nick’s head wobbled a little on his ruff as he turned hither and thither,
peering over the heads of the swarming students.
“That’s her over there, Harry, the young woman with the long hair.”
Harry looked in the direction of Nick’s transparent, pointing finger and saw
a tall ghost who caught sight of Harry looking at her, raised her eyebrows, and
drifted away through a solid wall.
Harry ran after her. Once through the door of the corridor into which she
had disappeared, he saw her at the very end of the p bead of light right back into Voldemort’s wand . . . and slowly . . .
very slowly . . . it moved along the golden thread . . . it trembled for a

looked as though it were made of the solidest, densest smoke. . . . It was a
head . . . now a chest and arms . . . the torso of Cedric Diggory.
If ever Harry might have released his wand from shock, it would have been
then, but instinct kept him clutching his wand tightly, so that the thread of
golden light remained unbroken, even though the thick gray ghost of Cedric
Diggory (
was
 it a ghost? it looked so solid) emerged in its entirety from the
end of Voldemort’s   he looked like a radish with a bad sunburn.
“. . . for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years, I
award Gryffindor House fifty points.”
Gryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; the stars overhead
seemed to quiver. Percy could be heard telling the other prefects, “My
brother, you know! My youngest brother! Got past McGonagall’s giant chess
set!”
At last there was silence again.
“Second — to Miss Hermione Granger . . . for the use of cool logic in the
face of fire, I award Gryffindor House fifty points.”
Hermione buried her face in her arms; Harry strongly suspected she hadburst into tears. Gryffindors up and down the table were beside themselves —
they were a hundred points up.
“Third — to Mr. Harry Potter . . .” said Dumbledore. The room went
deadly quiet. “. . . for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor
House sixty points.”
The din was deafening. Those who could add up while yelling themselves
hoarse knew that Gryffindor now had four hundred and seventy-t shook his hand
vigorously, while the Weasley twins yelled, “We got Potter! We got Potter!”
Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff he’d seen earlier. The ghost
patted his arm, giving Harry the sudden, horrible feeling he’d just plunged it
into a bucket of ice-cold water.He could see the High Table properly now. At the end nearest him sat
Hagrid, who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up. Harry grinned back.
And there, in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair, sat Albus
Dumbledore. Harry recognized him at once from the card he’d gotten out of
the Chocolate Frog on the train. Dumbledore’s silver hair was the only thing
in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts. Harry spotted Professor
Quirrell, too, the nervous young man from the Leaky Cauldron. He was
looking very peculiar in a large purple turban.
And now there were only four people left to be sorted. “Thomas, Dean,” a
black boy even taller than Ron, joined Harry at the Gryffindor table. “Turpin,
Lisa,” became a Ravenclaw  rom a doorway to the right — the
rest of the school must already be here — but Professor McGonagall showed
the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in,
standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering
about nervously.
“Welcome to Hogwarts,” said Professor McGonagall. “The start-of-term
banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall,
you will be sorted into your Houses. The Sorting is a very importantceremony because, while you are here, your House will be something like
your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your
House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free time in your House
common room.
“The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and
Slytherin. Each House has its own noble history and each has produced
outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs
will earn your House points, while any rule-breaking will lose House points.
At the end of the ing animatedly to tiny little Professor Flitwick, the
Charms teacher. Harry moved his eyes along the table, to the place where
Snape sat. Was he imagining it, or were Snape’s eyes flickering toward Lupin
more often than was natural?
The feast finished with an entertainment provided by the Hogwarts ghosts.
They popped out of the walls and tables to do a bit of formation gliding;
Nearly Headless Nick, the Gryffindor ghost, had a great success with a
reenactment of his own botched beheading.
It had been such a pleasant evening that Harry’s good mood couldn’t even
be spoiled by Malfoy, who shouted through the crowd as they all left the hall,
“The dementors send their love, Potter!”Harry, Ron, and Hermione followed the rest of the Gryffindors along the
usual path to Gryffindor Tower, but when they reached the corridor that ended
with the portrait of the Fat Lady, they found it jammed with students.
“Why isn’t anyone going in?” said Ron curiously.
Harry peered over the heads in front of him. The portrait seemed to  ances he deserves? He
gives us all a bad name and you know, he’s not really even a ghost — I say,
what are you all doing here?”
A ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first years.
Nobody answered.
“New students!” said the Fat Friar, smiling around at them. “About to be
Sorted, I suppose?”
A few people nodded mutely.
“Hope to see you in Hufflepuff!” said the Friar. “My old House, you
know.”
“Move along now,” said a sharp voice. “The Sorting Ceremony’s about to
start.”
Professor McGonagall had returned. One by one, the ghosts floated away
through the opposite wall.
“Now, form a line,” Professor McGonagall told the first years, “and follow
me.”
Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into line
behind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind him, and they walked out of
the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors into theGreat Hall.
Harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place. It was lit
by thousands and thousands of candles tha House you’ll be in?
I’ve been asking around, and I hope I’m in Gryffindor, it sounds by far the
best; I hear Dumbledore himself was in it, but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn’t
be too bad. . . . Anyway, we’d better go and look for Neville’s toad. You two
had better change, you know, I expect we’ll be there soon.”
And she left, taking the toadless boy with her.“Whatever House I’m in, I hope she’s not in it,” said Ron. He threw his
wand back into his trunk. “Stupid spell — George gave it to me, bet he knew
it was a dud.”
“What House are your brothers in?” asked Harry.
“Gryffindor,” said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling on him again. “Mum
and Dad were in it, too. I don’t know what they’ll say if I’m not. I don’t
suppose Ravenclaw 
would
 be too bad, but imagine if they put me in
Slytherin.”
“That’s the House Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who was in?”
“Yeah,” said Ron. He flopped back into his seat, looking depressed.
“You know, I think the ends of Scabbers’ whiskers are a bit lighter,” said
Harry, trying to take Ron’s mind "
What magical creature pulls the carriages to Hogwarts?,Thestrals,"According to the text, the magical creatures that pull the carriages to Hogwarts are not explicitly mentioned. However, it is mentioned that the carriages are ""horseless"", implying that they are pulled by magical means rather than horses.",", I wouldn’t fancy crossing the lake in this weather,” said Hermione
fervently, shivering as they inched slowly along the dark platform with the
rest of the crowd. A hundred horseless carriages stood waiting for them
outside the station. Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Neville climbed gratefully into
one of them, the door shut with a snap, and a few moments later, with a great
lurch, the long procession of carriages was rumbling and splashing its way up
the track toward Hogwarts Castle.T
 
CHAPTER  TWELVE
THE TRIWIZARD TOURNAMENT
hrough the gates, flanked with statues of winged boars, and up the
sweeping drive the carriages trundled, swaying dangerously in what
was fast becoming a gale. Leaning against the window, Harry could see
Hogwarts coming nearer, its many lighted windows blurred and shimmering
behind the thick curtain of rain. Lightning flashed across the sky as their
carriage came to a halt before the great oak front doors, which stood at the top
of a flight of stone steps. People who had occupied the carri flustered, and
following Krum through the crowd and out of sight.
“You’d better hurry up!” Ron called loudly after her. “The carriages’ll be
here in a minute!”
He let Harry keep a watch for the carriages, however, and spent the next
few minutes craning his neck over the crowd to try and see what Krum and
Hermione might be up to. They returned quite soon. Ron stared at Hermione,
but her face was quite impassive.
“I liked Diggory,” said Krum abruptly to Harry. “He vos alvays polite to
me. Alvays. Even though I vos from Durmstrang — with Karkaroff,” he
added, scowling.
“Have you got a new headmaster yet?” said Harry.Krum shrugged. He held out his hand as Fleur had done, shook Harry’s
hand, and then Ron’s. Ron looked as though he was suffering some sort of
painful internal struggle. Krum had already started walking away when Ron
burst out, “Can I have your autograph?”
Hermione turned away, smiling at the horseless carriages that were now
trundling toward them up the drive, as Krum, looking surprised but gratified  frightened. Harry could not see
why. The hall was quite empty but for themselves, the sobbing Bellatrix still
trapped under her statue, and the tiny baby Fawkes croaking feebly on the
floor —
And then Harry’s scar burst open. He knew he was dead: it was pain
beyond imagining, pain past endurance —
He was gone from the hall, he was locked in the coils of a creature with red
eyes, so tightly bound that Harry did not know where his body ended and the
creature’s began. They were fused together, bound by pain, and there was no
escape —
And when the creature spoke, it used Harry’s mouth, so that in his agony he
felt his jaw move. . . .
“Kill me now, Dumbledore . . .”
Blinded and dying, every part of him screaming for release, Harry felt the
creature use him again. . . .
“If death is nothing, Dumbledore, kill the boy . . .”Let the pain stop,
 thought Harry. 
Let him kill us. . . . End it,
Dumbledore. . . . Death is nothing compared to this. . . .
And I’ll see Sirius again. . . .
And as Harry’s heart filled with emo  are those horse things?” Harry said, as he, Ron, and
Luna made for the carriage in which Hermione and Ginny were already
sitting.“What horse things?”
“The horse things pulling the carriages!” said Harry impatiently; they were,
after all, about three feet from the nearest one; it was watching them with
empty white eyes. Ron, however, gave Harry a perplexed look.
“What are you talking about?”
“I’m talking about — look!”
Harry grabbed Ron’s arm and wheeled him about so that he was face-to-
face with the winged horse. Ron stared straight at it for a second, then looked
back at Harry.
“What am I supposed to be looking at?”
“At the — there, between the shafts! Harnessed to the coach! It’s right
there in front —”
But as Ron continued to look bemused, a strange thought occurred to
Harry.
“Can’t . . . can’t you see them?”
“See 
what
?”
“Can’t you see what’s pulling the carriages?”
Ron looked seriously alarmed now.
“Are you feeling all right, Harry?”
“I . . . yeah . . .”
Harry felt utterly bewildered. The horse was th ace-to-face with him at Hogwarts. Remembering their
last meeting as he stood at the dark window, Harry had to admit he was lucky
even to have reached his thirteenth birthday.
He scanned the starry sky for a sign of Hedwig, perhaps soaring back to
him with a dead mouse dangling from her beak, expecting praise. Gazing
absently over the rooftops, it was a few seconds before Harry realized what he
was seeing.
Silhouetted against the golden moon, and growing larger every moment,
was a large, strangely lopsided creature, and it was flapping in Harry’s
direction. He stood quite still, watching it sink lower and lower. For a split
second he hesitated, his hand on the window latch, wondering whether to
slam it shut. But then the bizarre creature soared over one of the street lamps
of Privet Drive, and Harry, realizing what it was, leapt aside.Through the window soared three owls, two of them holding up the third,
which appeared to be unconscious. They landed with a soft 
flump
 on Harry’s
bed, and the middle owl, whic No Pain, No Stain! . . . Gladrags Wizardwear — London, Paris,
Hogsmeade . . .
Harry tore his eyes away from the sign and looked over his shoulder to see
who else was sharing the box with them. So far it was empty, except for a tiny
creature sitting in the second from last seat at the end of the row behind them.
The creature, whose legs were so short they stuck out in front of it on the
chair, was wearing a tea towel draped like a toga, and it had its face hidden in
its hands. Yet those long, batlike ears were oddly familiar. . . .
“Dobby?”
 said Harry incredulously.
The tiny creature looked up and stretched its fingers, revealing enormous
brown eyes and a nose the exact size and shape of a large tomato. It wasn’t
Dobby — it was, however, unmistakably a house-elf, as Harry’s friend Dobby
had been. Harry had set Dobby free from his old owners, the Malfoy family.
“Did sir just call me Dobby?” squeaked the elf curiously from between its
fingers. Its voice was higher even than Dobby’s had been, a teeny, quivering
 ing room, Harry caught a glimpse of Uncle
Vernon and Dudley in bow ties and dinner jackets. He had only just reached
the upstairs landing when the doorbell rang and Uncle Vernon’s furious face
appeared at the foot of the stairs.
“Remember, boy — one sound —”
Harry crossed to his bedroom on tiptoe, slipped inside, closed the door, and
turned to collapse on his bed.
The trouble was, there was already someone sitting on it.H
 
CHAPTER  TWO
DOBBY’S WARNING
arry managed not to shout out, but it was a close thing. The little
creature on the bed had large, bat-like ears and bulging green eyes the
size of tennis balls. Harry knew instantly that this was what had been
watching him out of the garden hedge that morning.
As they stared at each other, Harry heard Dudley’s voice from the hall.
“May I take your coats, Mr. and Mrs. Mason?”
The creature slipped off the bed and bowed so low that the end of its long,
thin nose touched the carpet. Harry noticed that it was wearing what looked
like an old pillowcase, with rips fo off toward the
engine end of the train, Harry felt an odd sense of loss. He had never traveled
on the Hogwarts Express without Ron.
“Come on,” Ginny told him, “if we get a move on we’ll be able to save
them places.”
“Right,” said Harry, picking up Hedwig’s cage in one hand and the handle
of his trunk in the other. They struggled off down the corridor, peering
through the glass-paneled doors into the compartments they passed, which
were already full. Harry could not help noticing that a lot of people stared
back at him with great interest and that several of them nudged their
neighbors and pointed him out. After he had met this behavior in five
consecutive carriages he remembered that the 
Daily Prophet 
had been telling
its readers all summer what a lying show-off he was. He wondered bleakly
whether the people now staring and whispering believed the stories.
In the very last carriage they met Neville Longbottom, Harry’s fellow fifth-
year Gryffindor, his round face shining with the effort of pulling his trunk"
What is the name of the house elf who serves the Malfoy family?,Dobby,"The house-elf who serves the Malfoy family is not explicitly mentioned in this passage. However, it is mentioned that Dobby, a house-elf, is bound to serve the Malfoy family, but he is not the one who serves them.

“Must be, it’s not a very common name, is it?” said Harry. “Why?”
“I’ve heard Dad talking about him,” said George. “He was a big supporter
of You-Know-Who.”
“And when You-Know-Who disappeared,” said Fred, craning around to
look at Harry, “Lucius Malfoy came back saying he’d never meant any of it.
Load of dung — Dad reckons he was right in You-Know-Who’s inner circle.”
Harry had heard these rumors about Malfoy’s family before, and they
didn’t surprise him at all. Malfoy made Dudley Dursley look like a kind,
thoughtful, and sensitive boy.
“I don’t know whether the Malfoys own a house-elf. . . .” said Harry.
“Well, whoever owns him will be an old Wizarding family, and they’ll be
rich,” said Fred.
“Yeah, Mum’s always wishing we had a house-elf to do the ironing,” said
George. “But all we’ve got is a lousy old ghoul in the attic and gnomes all
over the garden. House-elves come with big old manors and castles and
places like that; you wouldn’t catch one in our house. .  ken up with a particularly loud
screech and was beating her wings wildly against the bars of her cage.“Dobby had to punish himself, sir,” said the elf, who had gone slightly
cross-eyed. “Dobby almost spoke ill of his family, sir. . . .”
“Your family?”
“The wizard family Dobby serves, sir. . . . Dobby is a house-elf — bound to
serve one house and one family forever. . . .”
“Do they know you’re here?” asked Harry curiously.
Dobby shuddered.
“Oh, no, sir, no . . . Dobby will have to punish himself most grievously for
coming to see you, sir. Dobby will have to shut his ears in the oven door for
this. If they ever knew, sir —”
“But won’t they notice if you shut your ears in the oven door?”
“Dobby doubts it, sir. Dobby is always having to punish himself for
something, sir. They lets Dobby get on with it, sir. Sometimes they reminds
me to do extra punishments. . . .”
“But why don’t you leave? Escape?”
“A house-elf must be set free, sir. And the family will never set Dobby
free . . . Dobby will serve the family until t bay.
“What about her? Dobby — she hasn’t found out about this — about us —
about the D.A.?”He read the answer in the elf’s stricken face. His hands held fast by Harry,
the elf tried to kick himself and sank to his knees.
“Is she coming?” Harry asked quietly.
Dobby let out a howl. “Yes, Harry Potter, yes!”
Harry straightened up and looked around at the motionless, terrified people
gazing at the thrashing elf.
“WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?” Harry bellowed. “RUN!”
They all pelted toward the exit at once, forming a scrum at the door, then
people burst through; Harry could hear them sprinting along the corridors and
hoped they had the sense not to try and make it all the way to their
dormitories. It was only ten to nine, if they just took refuge in the library or
the Owlery, which were both nearer —
“Harry, come on!” shrieked Hermione from the center of the knot of people
now fighting to get out.
He scooped up Dobby, who was still attempting to do himself serious
injury, and ran with the elf in his arms to join the ”
“But naturally, you would not care how many times you heard from a

Dumbledore.
“Serious miscarriage, my hat!” said Fudge at the top of his voice. “Have
you ever bothered to tot up the number of cock-and-bull stories this boy has
come out with, Dumbledore, while trying to cover up his flagrant misuse of
magic out of school? I suppose you’ve forgotten the Hover Charm he used
three years ago —”
“That wasn’t me, it was a house-elf!” said Harry.
“YOU SEE?” roared Fudge, gesturing flamboyantly in Harry’s direction.
“A house-elf! In a Muggle house! I ask you —”
“The house-elf in question is currently in the employ of Hogwarts School,”
said Dumbledore. “I can summon him here in an instant to give evidence if
you wish.”
“I — not — I haven’t got time to listen to house-elves! Anyway, that’s not
the only — he blew up his aunt, for God’s sake!” Fudge shouted, banging his
fist on the judge’s bench and upsetting a bottle of ink.
“And you very kindly  m their climb, was just considering taking off the
Cloak for a few minutes when they heard voices nearby. Someone was
climbing toward the house from the other side of the hill; moments later,
Malfoy had appeared, followed closely by Crabbe and Goyle. Malfoy was
speaking.
“. . . should have an owl from Father any time now. He had to go to the
hearing to tell them about my arm . . . about how I couldn’t use it for three
months. . . .”
Crabbe and Goyle sniggered.
“I really wish I could hear that great hairy moron trying to defend
himself . . . ‘There’s no ’arm in ’im, ’onest —’ . . . that hippogriff’s as good as
dead —”
Malfoy suddenly caught sight of Ron. His pale face split in a malevolent
grin.
“What are you doing, Weasley?”
Malfoy looked up at the crumbling house behind Ron.
“Suppose you’d love to live here, wouldn’t you, Weasley? Dreaming about
having your own bedroom? I heard your family all sleep in one room — is
that true?”
Harry seized the back of Ron’s robes to stop him from leaping on Malfoy.“Leave hi oduced him to the wizards on
either side of him.
“Harry Potter, you know,” he told the Bulgarian minister loudly, who was
wearing splendid robes of black velvet trimmed with gold and didn’t seem to
understand a word of English. “
Harry Potter
 . . . oh come on now, you know
who he is . . . the boy who survived You-Know-Who . . . you 
do
 know who he
is —”
The Bulgarian wizard suddenly spotted Harry’s scar and started gabbling
loudly and excitedly, pointing at it.
“Knew we’d get there in the end,” said Fudge wearily to Harry. “I’m no
great shakes at languages; I need Barty Crouch for this sort of thing. Ah, I see
his house-elf’s saving him a seat. . . . Good job too, these Bulgarian blighters
have been trying to cadge all the best places . . . ah, and here’s Lucius!”
Harry, Ron, and Hermione turned quickly. Edging along the second row to
three still-empty seats right behind Mr. Weasley were none other than Dobby
the house-elf’s former owners: Lucius Malfoy; his son, Draco; and a woman
Harry supposed must be Dr this!” said Malfoy in ecstasy, holding up Ron’s robes and showing
Crabbe and Goyle, “Weasley, you weren’t thinking of 
wearing
 these, were
you? I mean — they were very fashionable in about 1890. . . .”
“Eat dung, Malfoy!” said Ron, the same color as the dress robes as he
snatched them back out of Malfoy’s grip. Malfoy howled with derisive
laughter; Crabbe and Goyle guffawed stupidly.
“So . . . going to enter, Weasley? Going to try and bring a bit of glory to the
family name? There’s money involved as well, you know . . . you’d be able to
afford some decent robes if you won. . . .”
“What are you talking about?” snapped Ron.
“Are you going to enter?”
 Malfoy repeated. “I suppose 
you
 will, Potter?
You never miss a chance to show off, do you?”
“Either explain what you’re on about or go away, Malfoy,” said Hermione
testily, over the top of 
The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 4.
A gleeful smile spread across Malfoy’s pale face.
“Don’t tell me you don’t 
know
?” he said delightedly. “You’ve got a father
and broth ter,” said Winky
firmly, from behind her hands. “House-elves does what they is told. I is not
liking heights at all, Harry Potter” — she glanced toward the edge of the box
and gulped — “but my master sends me to the Top Box and I comes, sir.”
“Why’s he sent you up here, if he knows you don’t like heights?” said
Harry, frowning.
“Master — master wants me to save him a seat, Harry Potter. He is very
busy,” said Winky, tilting her head toward the empty space beside her.
“Winky is wishing she is back in master’s tent, Harry Potter, but Winky does
what she is told. Winky is a good house-elf.”
She gave the edge of the box another frightened look and hid her eyes
completely again. Harry turned back to the others.
“So that’s a house-elf?” Ron muttered. “Weird things, aren’t they?”
“Dobby was weirder,” said Harry fervently.
Ron pulled out his Omnioculars and started testing them, staring down into
the crowd on the other side of the stadium.
“Wild!” he said, twiddling the replay knob on the side. “I can make that old

Who is the Half-Blood Prince?,Severus Snape,"The Half-Blood Prince is not explicitly stated in this passage, but it seems that Harry is trying to figure out the identity of the Half-Blood Prince, and Lupin is unaware of who it might be.","h the picture
belonged; it was a rather dull story about interschool competitions.
“Her name was Eileen Prince. 
Prince,
 Harry.”
They looked at each other, and Harry realized what Hermione was trying to
say. He burst out laughing.
“No way.”
“What?”
“You think 
she
 was the Half-Blood . . . ? Oh, come on.”
“Well, why not? Harry, there aren’t any real princes in the Wizarding
world! It’s either a nickname, a made-up title somebody’s given themselves,
or it could be their actual name, couldn’t it? No, listen! If, say, her father wasa wizard whose surname was Prince, and her mother was a Muggle, then that
would make her a ‘half-blood Prince’!”
“Yeah, very ingenious, Hermione . . .”
“But it would! Maybe she was proud of being half a Prince!”
“Listen, Hermione, I can tell it’s not a girl. I can just tell.”
“The truth is that you don’t think a girl would have been clever enough,”
said Hermione angrily.
“How can I have hung round with you for five years and not think girls are
clever?” said Harry, stung by this. “It rewolves deserve blood, that we ought to
revenge ourselves on normal people.”
“But you are normal!” said Harry fiercely. “You’ve just got a — a problem
—”
Lupin burst out laughing. “Sometimes you remind me a lot of James. He
called it my ‘furry little problem’ in company. Many people were under the
impression that I owned a badly behaved rabbit.”
He accepted a glass of eggnog from Mr. Weasley with a word of thanks,
looking slightly more cheerful. Harry, meanwhile, felt a rush of excitement:
This last mention of his father had reminded him that there was something he
had been looking forward to asking Lupin.
“Have you ever heard of someone called the Half-Blood Prince?”
“The Half-Blood what?”
“Prince,” said Harry, watching him closely for signs of recognition.
“There are no Wizarding princes,” said Lupin, now smiling. “Is this a title
you’re thinking of adopting? I should have thought being ‘the Chosen One’
would be enough.”
“It’s nothing to do with me!” said Harry indignantly. “The Half-Blood
Prince is someon ns Harry continued to follow the
Half-Blood Prince’s instructions wherever they deviated from Libatius
Borage’s, with the result that by their fourth lesson Slughorn was raving about
Harry’s abilities, saying that he had rarely taught anyone so talented. Neither
Ron nor Hermione was delighted by this. Although Harry had offered to share
his book with both of them, Ron had more difficulty deciphering the
handwriting than Harry did, and could not keep asking Harry to read aloud or
it might look suspicious. Hermione, meanwhile, was resolutely plowing on
with what she called the “official” instructions, but becoming increasingly
bad-tempered as they yielded poorer results than the Prince’s.
Harry wondered vaguely who the Half-Blood Prince had been. Although
the amount of homework they had been given prevented him from reading the
whole of his copy of 
Advanced Potion-Making,
 he had skimmed through it
sufficiently to see that there was barely a page on which the Prince had not
made additional notes, not all of th from the Half-Blood Prince than Snape or Slughorn have taught
me in —”
“I’m not talking about your stupid so-called Prince,” said Hermione, giving
his book a nasty look as though it had been rude to her. “I’m talking about
earlier. I went into the girls’ bathroom just before I came in here and there
were about a dozen girls in there, including that Romilda Vane, trying to
decide how to slip you a love potion. They’re all hoping they’re going to get
you to take them to Slughorn’s party, and they all seem to have bought Fred
and George’s love potions, which I’m afraid to say probably work —”
“Why didn’t you confiscate them then?” demanded Harry. It seemed
extraordinary that Hermione’s mania for upholding rules could have
abandoned her at this crucial juncture.
“They didn’t have the potions with them in the bathroom,” said Hermione
scornfully. “They were just discussing tactics. As I doubt whether even the
Half-Blood Prince

“
could dream
up an antidote for a dozen diff ked anyone, have you?” said Ron. “You and Cho
just —”
“Sort of fell apart, yeah,” said Harry.
“Wish that would happen with me and Lavender,” said Ron gloomily,
watching Hermione silently tapping each of his misspelled words with the end
of her wand, so that they corrected themselves on the page. “But the more I
hint I want to finish it, the tighter she holds on. It’s like going out with the
giant squid.”
“There,” said Hermione, some twenty minutes later, handing back Ron’s
essay.“Thanks a million,” said Ron. “Can I borrow your quill for the
conclusion?”
Harry, who had found nothing useful in the Half-Blood Prince’s notes so
far, looked around; the three of them were now the only ones left in the
common room, Seamus having just gone up to bed cursing Snape and his
essay. The only sounds were the crackling of the fire and Ron scratching out
one last paragraph on dementors using Hermione’s quill. Harry had just
closed the Half-Blood Prince’s book, yawning, when —
Crack.
Hermione let out a little shriek; Ron spil  about that
now?”
“No — no — Harry, I didn’t mean that!” she said hastily, looking around to
check that they were not being overheard. “It’s just that I was right about
Eileen Prince once owning the book. You see . . . she was Snape’s mother!”
“I thought she wasn’t much of a looker,” said Ron. Hermione ignored him.
“I was going through the rest of the old 
Prophets
 and there was a tiny
announcement about Eileen Prince marrying a man called Tobias Snape, and
then later an announcement saying that she’d given birth to a —”
“— murderer,” spat Harry.
“Well . . . yes,” said Hermione. “So . . . I was sort of right. Snape must have
been proud of being ‘half a Prince,’ you see? Tobias Snape was a Muggle
from what it said in the 
Prophet.
”
“Yeah, that fits,” said Harry. “He’d play up the pure-blood side so he could
get in with Lucius Malfoy and the rest of them. . . . He’s just like Voldemort.
Pure-blood mother, Muggle father . . . ashamed of his parentage, trying to
make himself feared using the Dark Arts, gave him em concerned with potion-making. Here
and there were directions for what looked like spells that the Prince had made
up himself.
“Or herself,” said Hermione irritably, overhearing Harry pointing some of
these out to Ron in the common room on Saturday evening. “It might have
been a girl. I think the handwriting looks more like a girl’s than a boy’s.”“The Half-Blood 
Prince,
 he was called,” Harry said. “How many girls have
been Princes?”
Hermione seemed to have no answer to this. She merely scowled and
twitched her essay on 
The Principles of Rematerialization
 away from Ron,
who was trying to read it upside down.
Harry looked at his watch and hurriedly put the old copy of 
Advanced
Potion-Making
 back into his bag.
“It’s five to eight, I’d better go, I’ll be late for Dumbledore.”
“Ooooh!” gasped Hermione, looking up at once. “Good luck! We’ll wait
up, we want to hear what he teaches you!”
“Hope it goes okay,” said Ron, and the pair of them watched Harry leave
through the portrait hole.
Harry proceeded through all him ‘Prince.’”
Abandoning pretense, Harry said, “And it wasn’t Sirius? Or you?”
“Definitely not.”
“Oh.” Harry stared into the fire. “I just thought — well, he’s helped me out
a lot in Potions classes, the Prince has.”
“How old is this book, Harry?”
“I dunno, I’ve never checked.”
“Well, perhaps that will give you some clue as to when the Prince was at
Hogwarts,” said Lupin.
Shortly after this, Fleur decided to imitate Celestina singing “A Cauldron
Full of Hot, Strong Love,” which was taken by everyone, once they had
glimpsed Mrs. Weasley’s expression, to be the cue to go to bed. Harry and
Ron climbed all the way up to Ron’s attic bedroom, where a camp bed had
been added for Harry.
Ron fell asleep almost immediately, but Harry delved into his trunk and
pulled out his copy of 
Advanced Potion-Making
 before getting into bed.
There he turned its pages, searching, until he finally found, at the front of the
book, the date that it had been published. It was nearly fifty years old. Neither
his father, nor his fa"
What is the spell to summon objects?,Accio,"According to the passage, the spell to summon objects is not explicitly mentioned. However, it is mentioned that Bellatrix Lestrange is about to touch the Dark Mark to summon her master, Voldemort. The Dark Mark is not a spell, but a symbol of the Death Eaters' allegiance to Voldemort.","pened behind Harry. A woman spoke, and the
sound of the voice wound Harry’s fear to an even higher pitch.
“What is this? What’s happened, Cissy?”
Bellatrix Lestrange walked slowly around the prisoners, and stopped on
Harry’s right, staring at Hermione through her heavily lidded eyes.
“But surely,” she said quietly, “this is the Mudblood girl? This is Granger?”
“Yes, yes, it’s Granger!” cried Lucius. “And beside her, we think, Potter!
Potter and his friends, caught at last!”
“Potter?” shrieked Bellatrix, and she backed away, the better to take in
Harry. “Are you sure? Well then, the Dark Lord must be informed at once!”
She dragged back her left sleeve: Harry saw the Dark Mark burned into the
flesh of her arm, and knew that she was about to touch it, to summon her
beloved master —
“I was about to call him!” said Lucius, and his hand actually closed upon
Bellatrix’s wrist, preventing her from touching the Mark. “
I 
shall summon
him, Bella, Potter has been brought to my house, and it is therefore upon my
authori he Heir of
Slytherin; I am sure that Voldemort considered it of stupendous importance.”
“So, the other Horcruxes?” said Harry. “Do you think you know what they
are, sir?”
“I can only guess,” said Dumbledore. “For the reasons I have alreadygiven, I believe that Lord Voldemort would prefer objects that, in themselves,
have a certain grandeur. I have therefore trawled back through Voldemort’s
past to see if I can find evidence that such artifacts have disappeared around
him.”
“The locket!” said Harry loudly. “Hufflepuff’s cup!”
“Yes,” said Dumbledore, smiling, “I would be prepared to bet — perhaps
not my other hand — but a couple of fingers, that they became Horcruxes
three and four. The remaining two, assuming again that he created a total of
six, are more of a problem, but I will hazard a guess that, having secured
objects from Hufflepuff and Slytherin, he set out to track down objects owned
by Gryffindor or Ravenclaw. Four objects from the four founders would, I am
sure, have exerted a powerful pull over Vold usband in her
cold, clear voice. “Completely sure that it is Potter, before we summon the
Dark Lord . . . They say this is his” — she was looking closely at the
blackthorn wand — “but it does not resemble Ollivander’s description. . . . If
we are mistaken, if we call the Dark Lord here for nothing . . . Remember
what he did to Rowle and Dolohov?”
“What about the Mudblood, then?” growled Greyback. Harry was nearly
thrown off his feet as the Snatchers forced the prisoners to swivel around
again, so that the light fell on Hermione instead.
“Wait,” said Narcissa sharply. “Yes — yes, she was in Madam Malkin’s
with Potter! I saw her picture in the 
Prophet

girl?”
“I . . . maybe . . . yeah.”“But then, that’s the Weasley boy!” shouted Lucius, striding around the
bound prisoners to face Ron. “It’s them, Potter’s friends — Draco, look at
him, isn’t it Arthur Weasley’s son, what’s his name — ?”
“Yeah,” said Draco again, his back to the prisoners. “It could be.”

“However, we should not congratulate ourselves too heartily. You
destroyed the diary and I the ring, but if we are right in our theory of a seven-
part soul, four Horcruxes remain.”
“And they could be anything?” said Harry. “They could be old tin cans or, I
dunno, empty potion bottles. . . .”
“You are thinking of Portkeys, Harry, which must be ordinary objects, easy
to overlook. But would Lord Voldemort use tin cans or old potion bottles to
guard his own precious soul? You are forgetting what I have showed you.
Lord Voldemort liked to collect trophies, and he preferred objects with a
powerful magical history. His pride, his belief in his own superiority, his
determination to carve for himself a startling place in magical history; these
things suggest to me that Voldemort would have chosen his Horcruxes with
some care, favoring objects worthy of the honor.”
“The diary wasn’t that special.”
“The diary, as you have said yourself, was proof that he was t -shifter exploded in a wisp of smoke.
The silver stag faded from sight. Harry wished it could have stayed, he could
have used some company . . . but he moved on, quickly and quietly as
possible, listening hard, his wand held high once more.
Left . . . right . . . left again . . . Twice he found himself facing dead ends.
He did the Four-Point Spell again and found that he was going too far east.
He turned back, took a right turn, and saw an odd golden mist floating ahead
of him.
Harry approached it cautiously, pointing the wand’s beam at it. This looked
like some kind of enchantment. He wondered whether he might be able to
blast it out of the way.
“Reducto!”
 he said.
The spell shot straight through the mist, leaving it intact. He supposed he
should have known better; the Reductor Curse was for solid objects. What
would happen if he walked through the mist? Was it worth chancing it, or
should he double back?
He was still hesitating when a scream shattered the silence.
“Fleur?” Harry yelled.
There was silence.  n, from the other side of the junk wall. “What’s
going on?”
“Harry?” mimicked Crabbe. “What’s going — 
no,
 Potter! 
Crucio!
”
Harry had lunged for the tiara; Crabbe’s curse missed him but hit the stone
bust, which flew into the air; the diadem soared upward and then dropped out
of sight in the mass of objects on which the bust had rested.
“STOP!” Malfoy shouted at Crabbe, his voice echoing through the
enormous room. “The Dark Lord wants him alive —”
“So? I’m not killing him, am I?” yelled Crabbe, throwing off Malfoy’s
restraining arm. “But if I can, I will, the Dark Lord wants him dead anyway,
what’s the diff — ?”
A jet of scarlet light shot past Harry by inches: Hermione had run around
the corner behind him and sent a Stunning Spell straight at Crabbe’s head. It
only missed because Malfoy pulled him out of the way.
“It’s that Mudblood! 
Avada Kedavra!
”
Harry saw Hermione dive aside, and his fury that Crabbe had aimed to kill
wiped all else from his mind. He shot a Stunning Spell at Crabbe, who
lurched out  ver, great difficulty with the idea of goblin-made objects
passing from wizard to wizard. You saw Griphook’s face when the tiara
passed under his eyes. He disapproves. I believe he thinks, as do the fiercest
of his kind, that it ought to have been returned to the goblins once the original
purchaser died. They consider our habit of keeping goblin-made objects,
passing them from wizard to wizard without further payment, little more than
theft.”
Harry had an ominous feeling now; he wondered whether Bill guessed
more than he was letting on.
“All I am saying,” said Bill, setting his hand on the door back into the
sitting room, “is to be very careful what you promise goblins, Harry. It wouldbe less dangerous to break into Gringotts than to renege on a promise to a
goblin.”
“Right,” said Harry as Bill opened the door, “yeah. Thanks. I’ll bear that in
mind.”
As he followed Bill back to the others a wry thought came to him, born no
doubt of the wine he had drunk. He seemed set on course to become just as
reckless a go amusing was
Hermione, who maintained a rigidly disapproving expression throughout and
refused to talk at all if Harry had used the 
Muffliato
 spell on anyone in the
vicinity.
Sitting up in bed, Harry turned the book sideways so as to examine more
closely the scribbled instructions for a spell that seemed to have caused the
Prince some trouble. There were many crossings-out and alterations, but
finally, crammed into a corner of the page, the scribble:
Levicorpus (nvbl)
While the wind and sleet pounded relentlessly on the windows, and Neville
snored loudly, Harry stared at the letters in brackets. 
Nvbl . . . 
that had to
mean “nonverbal.” Harry rather doubted he would be able to bring off this
particular spell; he was still having difficulty with nonverbal spells,
something Snape had been quick to comment on in every D.A.D.A. class. On
the other hand, the Prince had proved a much more effective teacher than
Snape so far.
Pointing his wand at nothing in particular, he gave it an upward flick and

he come back? Did you ever find out?”
“I have ideas,” said Dumbledore, “but no more than that.”
“What ideas, sir?”
“I shall tell you, Harry, when you have retrieved that memory from
Professor Slughorn,” said Dumbledore. “When you have that last piece of the
jigsaw, everything will, I hope, be clear . . . to both of us.”
Harry was still burning with curiosity and even though Dumbledore had
walked to the door and was holding it open for him, he did not move at once.
“Was he after the Defense Against the Dark Arts job again, sir? He didn’t
say. . . .”“Oh, he definitely wanted the Defense Against the Dark Arts job,” said
Dumbledore. “The aftermath of our little meeting proved that. You see, we
have never been able to keep a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher for
longer than a year since I refused the post to Lord Voldemort.”H
 
CHAPTER  TWENTY-ONE
THE UNKNOWABLE ROOM
arry wracked his brains over the next week as to how he was to
persuade Slughorn to hand over the true memory, b ogether, turning to stare at Harry. “But
you said —”
“Professor Snape, meanwhile,” said Dumbledore, raising his voice so that it
carried over all the muttering, “will be taking over the position of Defense
Against the Dark Arts teacher.”
“No!” said Harry, so loudly that many heads turned in his direction. He didnot care; he was staring up at the staff table, incensed. How could Snape be
given the Defense Against the Dark Arts job after all this time? Hadn’t it been
widely known for years that Dumbledore did not trust him to do it?
“But Harry, you said that Slughorn was going to be teaching Defense
Against the Dark Arts!” said Hermione.
“I thought he was!” said Harry, racking his brains to remember when
Dumbledore had told him this, but now that he came to think of it, he was
unable to recall Dumbledore ever telling him what Slughorn would be
teaching.
Snape, who was sitting on Dumbledore’s right, did not stand up at the
mention of his name; he merely raised a hand in lazy acknowledgment of the
applause from t  — yeah, all right,” said Harry. He turned back to Hermione, Ron, and
Nearly Headless Nick. “Brothers and sisters usually go in the same Houses,
don’t they?” he said. He was judging by the Weasleys, all seven of whom had
been put into Gryffindor.
“Oh no, not necessarily,” said Hermione. “Parvati Patil’s twin’s in
Ravenclaw, and they’re identical. You’d think they’d be together, wouldn’t
you?”
Harry looked up at the staff table. There seemed to be rather more empty
seats there than usual. Hagrid, of course, was still fighting his way across the
lake with the first years; Professor McGonagall was presumably supervisingthe drying of the entrance hall floor, but there was another empty chair too,
and Harry couldn’t think who else was missing.
“Where’s the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher?” said Hermione,
who was also looking up at the teachers.
They had never yet had a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher who had
lasted more than three terms. Harry’s favorite by far had been Professor
Lupin, who had res  instead, though eyes continued to
dart back regularly to Harry.“Well . . . erm . . . well, you know why you’re here. Erm . . . well, Harry
here had the idea — I mean” — Harry had thrown her a sharp look — “I had
the idea — that it might be good if people who wanted to study Defense
Against the Dark Arts — and I mean, really study it, you know, not the
rubbish that Umbridge is doing with us” — (Hermione’s voice became
suddenly much stronger and more confident) — “because nobody could call
that Defense Against the Dark Arts” — “Hear, hear,” said Anthony Goldstein,
and Hermione looked heartened — “well, I thought it would be good if we,
well, took matters into our own hands.”
She paused, looked sideways at Harry, and went on, “And by that I mean
learning how to defend ourselves properly, not just theory but the real spells
—”
“You want to pass your Defense Against the Dark Arts O.W.L. too though,
I bet?” said Michael Corner.
“Of course I do,” said Hermione at once. “But I want more than that, I want
to be prope Dark Arts teacher.”
There was some scattered, rather unenthusiastic applause. Only those who
had been in the compartment on the train with Professor Lupin clapped hard,
Harry among them. Professor Lupin looked particularly shabby next to all the
other teachers in their best robes.
“Look at Snape!” Ron hissed in Harry’s ear.
Professor Snape, the Potions master, was staring along the staff table at
Professor Lupin. It was common knowledge that Snape wanted the Defense
Against the Dark Arts job, but even Harry, who hated Snape, was startled at
the expression twisting his thin, sallow face. It was beyond anger: It was
loathing. Harry knew that expression only too well; it was the look Snape
wore every time he set eyes on Harry.
“As to our second new appointment,” Dumbledore continued as the
lukewarm applause for Professor Lupin died away. “Well, I am sorry to tell
you that Professor Kettleburn, our Care of Magical Creatures teacher, retired
at the end of last year in order to enjoy more time with his remaining li  none more so than Malfoy.
“Ah, if only my arm was feeling a bit better!” he sighed as the gale outside
pounded the windows.
Harry had no room in his head to worry about anything except the match
tomorrow. Oliver Wood kept hurrying up to him between classes and giving
him tips. The third time this happened, Wood talked for so long that Harry
suddenly realized he was ten minutes late for Defense Against the Dark Arts,
and set off at a run with Wood shouting after him, “Diggory’s got a very fast
swerve, Harry, so you might want to try looping him —”
Harry skidded to a halt outside the Defense Against the Dark Arts
classroom, pulled the door open, and dashed inside.
“Sorry I’m late, Professor Lupin, I —”
But it wasn’t Professor Lupin who looked up at him from the teacher’s
desk; it was Snape.
“This lesson began ten minutes ago, Potter, so I think we’ll make it ten
points from Gryffindor. Sit down.”
But Harry didn’t move.
“Where’s Professor Lupin?” he said.
“He says he is feeling too ill to teach today,” said Sna “It’s none of your business!”
“If you tell me what you are trying to do, I can assist you —”
“I’ve got all the assistance I need, thanks, I’m not alone!”
“You were certainly alone tonight, which was foolish in the extreme,
wandering the corridors without lookouts or backup, these are elementary
mistakes —”
“I would’ve had Crabbe and Goyle with me if you hadn’t put them in
detention!”
“Keep your voice down!” spat Snape, for Malfoy’s voice had risen
excitedly. “If your friends Crabbe and Goyle intend to pass their Defense
Against the Dark Arts O.W.L. this time around, they will need to work a little
harder than they are doing at pres —”“What does it matter?” said Malfoy. “Defense Against the Dark Arts — it’s
all just a joke, isn’t it, an act? Like any of us need protecting against the Dark
Arts —”
“It is an act that is crucial to success, Draco!” said Snape. “Where do you
think I would have been all these years, if I had not known how to act? Now
listen to me! You are being incautious, wandering around at night ts everyone,” said Hermione, slightly
impatiently, “but you know, this is rather important, we’re talking about
learning to defend ourselves against V-Voldemort’s Death Eaters —”
“Well said!” barked Ernie Macmillan, whom Harry had been expecting to
speak long before this. “Personally I think this is really important, possibly
more important than anything else we’ll do this year, even with our O.W.L.s
coming up!”
He looked around impressively, as though waiting for people to cry,
“Surely not!” When nobody spoke, he went on, “I, personally, am at a loss to
see why the Ministry has foisted such a useless teacher upon us at this critical
period. Obviously they are in denial about the return of You-Know-Who, butto give us a teacher who is trying to actively prevent us from using defensive

CHAPTER  TEN
HALLOWEEN
alfoy couldn’t believe his eyes when he saw that Harry and Ron were
still at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful.
Indeed, by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the three-
headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were quite keen to have
another one. In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the package that
seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot
of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection.
“It’s either really valuable or really dangerous,” said Ron.
“Or both,” said Harry.
But as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was
about two inches long, they didn’t have much chance of guessing what it was
without further clues.
Neither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay
underneath the dog and the trapdoor. All Neville cared about was never going
near the dog again.
Hermione was now refusing to spea ts paws and fell to its knees,
then it slumped to the ground, fast asleep.
“Keep playing,” Ron warned Harry as they slipped out of the Cloak and
crept toward the trapdoor. They could feel the dog’s hot, smelly breath as they
approached the giant heads.
“I think we’ll be able to pull the door open,” said Ron, peering over the
dog’s back. “Want to go first, Hermione?”
“No, I don’t!”“All right.” Ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dog’s legs.
He bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor, which swung up and open.
“What can you see?” Hermione said anxiously.
“Nothing — just black — there’s no way of climbing down, we’ll just have
to drop.”
Harry, who was still playing the flute, waved at Ron to get his attention and
pointed at himself.
“You want to go first? Are you sure?” said Ron. “I don’t know how deep
this thing goes. Give the flute to Hermione so she can keep him asleep.”
Harry handed the flute over. In the few seconds’ silence, the dog growled
and twitched, but the moment Hermione began to pl  knew you’d seen me coming to look at what was guarding
the Stone.”
“
You
 let the troll in?”
“Certainly. I have a special gift with trolls — you must have seen what I
did to the one in the chamber back there? Unfortunately, while everyone else
was running around looking for it, Snape, who already suspected me, went
straight to the third floor to head me off — and not only did my troll fail to
beat you to death, that three-headed dog didn’t even manage to bite Snape’s
leg off properly.
“Now, wait quietly, Potter. I need to examine this interesting mirror.”
It was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell. It
was the Mirror of Erised.
“This mirror is the key to finding the Stone,” Quirrell murmured, tapping
his way around the frame. “Trust Dumbledore to come up with something like
this . . . but he’s in London . . . I’ll be far away by the time he gets back. . . .”
All Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and stop him
from concentrating on the mirror.
“I saw you and Sna hen, “let’s keep looking,” and he turned away,
wishing he had not seen the stone: He did not want his excited trepidation
tainted with resentment.
“Here!” cried Hermione again a few moments later from out of the
darkness. “Oh no, sorry! I thought it said Potter.”
She was rubbing at a crumbling, mossy stone, gazing down at it, a little
frown on her face.
“Harry, come back a moment.”He did not want to be sidetracked again, and only grudgingly made his way
back through the snow toward her.
“What?”
“Look at this!”
The grave was extremely old, weathered so that Harry could hardly make
out the name. Hermione showed him the symbol beneath it.
“Harry, that’s the mark in the book!”
He peered at the place she indicated: The stone was so worn that it was
hard to make out what was engraved there, though there did seem to be a
triangular mark beneath the nearly illegible name.
“Yeah . . . it could be. . . .”
Hermione lit her wand and pointed it at the name on the headstone.
“It says Ig
 — 
Ignotus, I think. . . .”
“I’m go ed,” Harry whispered. “I think we’ll be okay —
get 
off,
 Neville!” For Neville had been tugging on the sleeve of Harry’s
bathrobe for the last minute. 
“What?”
Harry turned around — and saw, quite clearly, what. For a moment, he was
sure he’d walked into a nightmare — this was too much, on top of everything
that had happened so far.
They weren’t in a room, as he had supposed. They were in a corridor. The
forbidden corridor on the third floor. And now they knew why it was
forbidden.
They were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a dog thatfilled the whole space between ceiling and floor. It had three heads. Three
pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching and quivering in their
direction; three drooling mouths, saliva hanging in slippery ropes from
yellowish fangs.
It was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and Harry knew that
the only reason they weren’t already dead was that their sudden appearance
had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over that, there wa  door, desperate to hear
more.
“Well, Arthur, you must do what you think is right. But you’re forgetting
Albus Dumbledore. I don’t think anything could hurt Harry at Hogwarts
while Dumbledore’s headmaster. I suppose he knows about all this?”
“Of course he knows. We had to ask him if he minds the Azkaban guards
stationing themselves around the entrances to the school grounds. He wasn’t
happy about it, but he agreed.”
“Not happy? Why shouldn’t he be happy, if they’re there to catch Black?”
“Dumbledore isn’t fond of the Azkaban guards,” said Mr. Weasley heavily.
“Nor am I, if it comes to that . . . but when you’re dealing with a wizard like
Black, you sometimes have to join forces with those you’d rather avoid.”
“If they save Harry —”
“— then I will never say another word against them,” said Mr. Weasley
wearily. “It’s late, Molly, we’d better go up. . . .”
Harry heard chairs move. As quietly as he could, he hurried down the
passage to the bar and out of sight. The parlor door opened, and a few seconds
later foot said Ron, but Hermione told him to be quiet until she’d looked
something up, and started flicking frantically through the pages, muttering to
herself.
At last she found what she was looking for.
“I knew it! I 
knew
 it!”
“Are we allowed to speak yet?” said Ron grumpily. Hermione ignored him.
“Nicolas Flamel,” she whispered dramatically, “is the 
only known maker of
the Sorcerer’s Stone
!”
This didn’t have quite the effect she’d expected.
“The what?” said Harry and Ron.“Oh, 
honestly,
 don’t you two read? Look — read that, there.”
She pushed the book toward them, and Harry and Ron read:
The ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the
Sorcerer’s Stone, a legendary substance with astonishing powers.
The Stone will transform any metal into pure gold. It also produces
the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal.
There have been many reports of the Sorcerer’s Stone over the
centuries, but the only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr.
Nicolas Flamel, the noted alchemist and opera lover.  repeated screeches of 
“MUDBLOODS! SCUM! CREATURES OF DIRT!”
“Leave your trunk and your owl, Alastor’s going to deal with the luggage. . . .
Oh, for heaven’s sake, Sirius, Dumbledore said no!”
A bearlike black dog had appeared at Harry’s side as Harry clambered overthe various trunks cluttering the hall to get to Mrs. Weasley.
“Oh honestly . . .” said Mrs. Weasley despairingly, “well, on your own head
be it!”
She wrenched open the front door and stepped out into the weak September
sunlight. Harry and the dog followed her. The door slammed behind them and
Mrs. Black’s screeches were cut off instantly.
“Where’s Tonks?” Harry said, looking around as they went down the stone
steps of number twelve, which vanished the moment they reached the
pavement.
“She’s waiting for us just up here,” said Mrs. Weasley stiffly, averting her
eyes from the lolloping black dog beside Harry.
An old woman greeted them on the corner. She had tightly curled gray hair
and wore a purple hat shaped like a porkpie.
“Wotcher, Harry,” she "
What creature is Aragog?,Acromantula,Aragog is a giant spider.,"pes shifted all around him.
“The thing that lives in the castle,” said Aragog, “is an ancient creature we
spiders fear above all others. Well do I remember how I pleaded with Hagrid
to let me go, when I sensed the beast moving about the school.”
“What is it?” said Harry urgently.
More loud clicking, more rustling; the spiders seemed to be closing in.
“We do not speak of it!” said Aragog fiercely. “We do not name it! I never
even told Hagrid the name of that dread creature, though he asked me, many
times.”
Harry didn’t want to press the subject, not with the spiders pressing closer
on all sides. Aragog seemed to be tired of talking. He was backing slowly into
his domed web, but his fellow spiders continued to inch slowly toward Harry
and Ron.
“We’ll just go, then,” Harry called desperately to Aragog, hearing leaves
rustling behind him.
“Go?” said Aragog slowly. “I think not. . . .”
“But — but —”
“My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid, on my command. But I
cannot deny them fresh meat, when it wanders so will t me coming down here, Hagrid.”
“Not in trouble, are yeh?” said Hagrid, looking up, alarmed. “Yeh shouldn’
be outta the castle in the evenin’, I know it, it’s my fault —”
“No, no, when he heard what I was doing he said he’d like to come and pay
his last respects to Aragog too,” said Harry. “He’s gone to change into
something more suitable, I think . . . and he said he’d bring some bottles so
we can drink to Aragog’s memory. . . .”
“Did he?” said Hagrid, looking both astonished and touched. “Tha’s —
tha’s righ’ nice of him, that is, an’ not turnin’ yeh in either. I’ve never really
had a lot ter do with Horace Slughorn before. . . . Comin’ ter see old Aragog
off, though, eh? Well . . . he’d’ve liked that, Aragog would. . . .”
Harry thought privately that what Aragog would have liked most about
Slughorn was the ample amount of edible flesh he provided, but he merely
moved to the rear window of Hagrid’s hut, where he saw the rather horrible
sight of the enormous dead spider lying on its back outside, its legs cur eyes streaming as he
mopped his face with his apron. “It’s . . . Aragog. . . . I think he’s dyin’. . . .
He got ill over the summer an’ he’s not gettin’ better. . . . I don’ know what I’ll
do if he . . . if he . . . We’ve bin tergether so long. . . .”
Hermione patted Hagrid’s shoulder, looking at a complete loss for anything
to say. Harry knew how she felt. He had known Hagrid to present a vicious
baby dragon with a teddy bear, seen him croon over giant scorpions with
suckers and stingers, attempt to reason with his brutal giant of a half-brother,
but this was perhaps the most incomprehensible of all his monster fancies: the
gigantic talking spider, Aragog, who dwelled deep in the Forbidden Forest
and which he and Ron had only narrowly escaped four years previously.
“Is there — is there anything we can do?” Hermione asked, ignoring Ron’s
frantic grimaces and head-shakings.
“I don’ think there is, Hermione,” choked Hagrid, attempting to stem the
flood of his tears. “See, the rest o’ the tribe . . . Aragog’s fa  frightened. Harry could not see
why. The hall was quite empty but for themselves, the sobbing Bellatrix still
trapped under her statue, and the tiny baby Fawkes croaking feebly on the
floor —
And then Harry’s scar burst open. He knew he was dead: it was pain
beyond imagining, pain past endurance —
He was gone from the hall, he was locked in the coils of a creature with red
eyes, so tightly bound that Harry did not know where his body ended and the
creature’s began. They were fused together, bound by pain, and there was no
escape —
And when the creature spoke, it used Harry’s mouth, so that in his agony he
felt his jaw move. . . .
“Kill me now, Dumbledore . . .”
Blinded and dying, every part of him screaming for release, Harry felt the
creature use him again. . . .
“If death is nothing, Dumbledore, kill the boy . . .”Let the pain stop,
 thought Harry. 
Let him kill us. . . . End it,
Dumbledore. . . . Death is nothing compared to this. . . .
And I’ll see Sirius again. . . .
And as Harry’s heart filled with emo  but decided against it; he didn’t think
his legs would support him. So he spoke from the ground, as calmly as he
could.
“They think, up at the school, that Hagrid’s been setting a — a —
something on students. They’ve taken him to Azkaban.”
Aragog clicked his pincers furiously, and all around the hollow the sound
was echoed by the crowd of spiders; it was like applause, except applause
didn’t usually make Harry feel sick with fear.
“But that was years ago,” said Aragog fretfully. “Years and years ago. I
remember it well. That’s why they made him leave the school. They believed
that 
I
 was the monster that dwells in what they call the Chamber of Secrets.
They thought that Hagrid had opened the Chamber and set me free.”
“And you . . . you didn’t come from the Chamber of Secrets?” said Harry,
who could feel cold sweat on his forehead.
“I!” said Aragog, clicking angrily. “I was not born in the castle. I come
from a distant land. A traveler gave me to Hagrid when I was an egg. Hagrid
was only a boy, but he cared   was the highest
point of Hagrid he could easily reach.
“Where are we burying him?” he asked. “The forest?”
“Blimey, no,” said Hagrid, wiping his streaming eyes on the bottom of his
shirt. “The other spiders won’ let me anywhere near their webs now Aragog’s
gone. Turns out it was on’y on his orders they didn’ eat me! Can yeh believe
that, Harry?”
The honest answer was “yes”; Harry recalled with painful ease the scene
when he and Ron had come face-to-face with the acromantulas: They had
been quite clear that Aragog was the only thing that stopped them from eating
Hagrid.
“Never bin an area o’ the forest I couldn’ go before!” said Hagrid, shaking
his head. “It wasn’ easy, gettin’ Aragog’s body out o’ there, I can tell yeh —
they usually eat their dead, see. . . . But I wanted ter give ’im a nice burial . . .
a proper send-off . . .”
He broke into sobs again and Harry resumed the patting of his elbow,
saying as he did so (for the potion seemed to indicate that it was the rightthing to do), “Professor Slughorn me  the misty, domed web, a spider the size of a small
elephant emerged, very slowly. There was gray in the black of his body and
legs, and each of the eyes on his ugly, pincered head was milky white. He was
blind.
“What is it?” he said, clicking his pincers rapidly.
“Men,” clicked the spider who had caught Harry.
“Is it Hagrid?” said Aragog, moving closer, his eight milky eyes wandering
vaguely.
“Strangers,” clicked the spider who had brought Ron.
“Kill them,” clicked Aragog fretfully. “I was sleeping. . . .”
“We’re friends of Hagrid’s,” Harry shouted. His heart seemed to have lefthis chest to pound in his throat.
Click, click, click
 went the pincers of the spiders all around the hollow.
Aragog paused.
“Hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before,” he said slowly.
“Hagrid’s in trouble,” said Harry, breathing very fast. “That’s why we’ve
come.”
“In trouble?” said the aged spider, and Harry thought he heard concern
beneath the clicking pincers. “But why has he sent you?”
Harry thought of getting to his feet to his bed and leaned back against his pillows,
watching the moon glinting at him through the tower window.
He couldn’t see what else they could do. They had hit dead ends
everywhere. Riddle had caught the wrong person, the Heir of Slytherin had
got off, and no one could tell whether it was the same person, or a different
one, who had opened the Chamber this time. There was nobody else to ask.
Harry lay down, still thinking about what Aragog had said.
He was becoming drowsy when what seemed like their very last hope
occurred to him, and he suddenly sat bolt upright.
“Ron,” he hissed through the dark, “Ron —”
Ron woke with a yelp like Fang’s, stared wildly around, and saw Harry.
“Ron — that girl who died. Aragog said she was found in a bathroom,”
said Harry, ignoring Neville’s snuffling snores from the corner. “What if she
never left the bathroom? What if she’s still there?”
Ron rubbed his eyes, frowning through the moonlight. And then he
understood, too.
“You

think — not

CHAPTER "

under his breath.
Harry waited until they could hear Xenophilius moving about in the kitchen
downstairs before speaking.
“What do you think?” he asked Hermione.
“Oh, Harry,” she said wearily, “it’s a pile of utter rubbish. This can’t be
what the sign really means. This must just be his weird take on it. What a
waste of time.”
“I s’pose this 
is
 the man who brought us Crumple-Horned Snorkacks,” said
Ron.
“You don’t believe it either?” Harry asked him.
“Nah, that story’s just one of those things you tell kids to teach them
lessons, isn’t it? ‘Don’t go looking for trouble, don’t pick fights, don’t go
messing around with stuff that’s best left alone! Just keep your head down,
mind your own business, and you’ll be okay.’ Come to think of it,” Ron
added, “maybe that story’s why elder wands are supposed to be unlucky.”“What are you talking about?”
“One of those superstitions, isn’t it? ‘May-born witches will marry
Muggles.’ ‘Jinx by twilight, undon er Madam Pomfrey’s care. His scars were as bad as ever
— in truth, he now bore a distinct resemblance to Mad-Eye Moody, though
thankfully with both eyes and legs — but in personality he seemed just the
same as ever. All that appeared to have changed was that he now had a great
liking for very rare steaks.
“. . . so eet ees lucky ’e is marrying me,” said Fleur happily, plumping up
Bill’s pillows, “because ze British overcook their meat, I ’ave always said
this.”
“I suppose I’m just going to have to accept that he really is going to marry
her,” sighed Ginny later that evening, as she, Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat
beside the open window of the Gryffindor common room, looking out over
the twilit grounds.
“She’s not that bad,” said Harry. “Ugly, though,” he added hastily, as Ginny
raised her eyebrows, and she let out a reluctant giggle.
“Well, I suppose if Mum can stand it, I can.”
“Anyone else we know died?” Ron asked Hermione, who was perusing the
Evening Prophet.
Hermione winced at the forced toughness in his v havior might be like
when he awakens. . . .”
Mrs. Weasley took the nasty-smelling ointment from Madam Pomfrey and
began dabbing at Bill’s wounds.
“And Dumbledore . . .” said Mr. Weasley. “Minerva, is it true . . . Is he
really . . . ?”
As Professor McGonagall nodded, Harry felt Ginny move beside him and
looked at her. Her slightly narrowed eyes were fixed upon Fleur, who was
gazing down at Bill with a frozen expression on her face.
“Dumbledore gone,” whispered Mr. Weasley, but Mrs. Weasley had eyes
only for her eldest son; she began to sob, tears falling onto Bill’s mutilated
face.
“Of course, it doesn’t matter how he looks. . . . It’s not r-really
important . . . but he was a very handsome little b-boy . . . always very
handsome . . . and he was g-going to be married!”
“And what do you mean by zat?” said Fleur suddenly and loudly. “What do
you mean, ‘’e was 
going
 to be married?’”
Mrs. Weasley raised her tear-stained face, looking startled. “Well — only
that —”
“You theenk Bill will not wish to marry me any  have you? Probably
wise. Be sure and marry a pureblood next time.”
Hermione had let out a little squeak of horror. Yaxley looked at her. She
coughed feebly and turned away.
“I — I —” stammered Ron.“But if 
my
 wife were accused of being a Mudblood,” said Yaxley, “— not
that any woman I married would ever be mistaken for such filth — and the
Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement needed a job doing, I
would make it my priority to do that job, Cattermole. Do you understand
me?”
“Yes,” whispered Ron.
“Then attend to it, Cattermole, and if my office is not completely dry
within an hour, your wife’s Blood Status will be in even graver doubt than it
is now.”
The golden grille before them clattered open. With a nod and unpleasant
smile to Harry, who was evidently expected to appreciate this treatment of
Cattermole, Yaxley swept away toward another lift. Harry, Ron, and
Hermione entered theirs, but nobody followed them: It was as if they were
infectious. The grilles shut with a clang and the lift began to eautiful tiara — goblin-made — which I am sure I could persuade her
to lend you for the wedding. She is very fond of Bill, you know, and it would
look lovely with your hair.”
“Thank you,” said Fleur stiffly. “I am sure zat will be lovely.”
And then, Harry did not quite see how it happened, both women were
crying and hugging each other. Completely bewildered, wondering whether
the world had gone mad, he turned around: Ron looked as stunned as he felt
and Ginny and Hermione were exchanging startled looks.
“You see!” said a strained voice. Tonks was glaring at Lupin. “She still
wants to marry him, even though he’s been bitten! She doesn’t care!”
“It’s different,” said Lupin, barely moving his lips and looking suddenly
tense. “Bill will not be a full werewolf. The cases are completely —”
“But I don’t care either, I don’t care!” said Tonks, seizing the front of
Lupin’s robes and shaking them. “I’ve told you a million times. . . .”And the meaning of Tonks’s Patronus and her mouse-colored hair, and the
reason she ha  her, I’ve made her an outcast!”
Lupin kicked aside the chair he had overturned.
“You have only ever seen me amongst the Order, or under Dumbledore’s
protection at Hogwarts! You don’t know how most of the Wizarding world
sees creatures like me! When they know of my affliction, they can barely talk
to me! Don’t you see what I’ve done? Even her own family is disgusted by
our marriage, what parents want their only daughter to marry a werewolf?
And the child — the child —”
Lupin actually seized handfuls of his own hair; he looked quite deranged.
“My kind don’t usually breed! It will be like me, I am convinced of it —how can I forgive myself, when I knowingly risked passing on my own
condition to an innocent child? And if, by some miracle, it is not like me, then
it will be better off, a hundred times so, without a father of whom it must
always be ashamed!”
“Remus!” whispered Hermione, tears in her eyes. “Don’t say that — how
could any child be ashamed of you?”
“Oh, I don’t know, Hermione,” said Harry. “I’d be pre coming, feel it building inside the wand pointed at his face.
“The true master of the Elder Wand was Draco Malfoy.”
Blank shock showed in Voldemort’s face for a moment, but then it was
gone.
“But what does it matter?” he said softly. “Even if you are right, Potter, itmakes no difference to you and me. You no longer have the phoenix wand:
We duel on skill alone . . . and after I have killed you, I can attend to Draco
Malfoy. . . .”
“But you’re too late,” said Harry. “You’ve missed your chance. I got there
first. I overpowered Draco weeks ago. I took this wand from him.”
Harry twitched the hawthorn wand, and he felt the eyes of everyone in the
Hall upon it.
“So it all comes down to this, doesn’t it?” whispered Harry. “Does the
wand in your hand know its last master was Disarmed? Because if it does . . .
I am the true master of the Elder Wand.”
A red-gold glow burst suddenly across the enchanted sky above them as an
edge of dazzling sun appeared over the sill of the nearest window. The light
hit both of their fa more?” demanded Fleur.
“You theenk, because of these bites, he will not love me?”“No, that’s not what I —”
“Because ’e will!” said Fleur, drawing herself up to her full height and
throwing back her long mane of silver hair. “It would take more zan a
werewolf to stop Bill loving me!”
“Well, yes, I’m sure,” said Mrs. Weasley, “but I thought perhaps — given
how — how he —”
“You thought I would not weesh to marry him? Or per’aps, you hoped?”
said Fleur, her nostrils flaring. “What do I care how he looks? I am good-
looking enough for both of us, I theenk! All these scars show is zat my
husband is brave! And I shall do zat!” she added fiercely, pushing Mrs.
Weasley aside and snatching the ointment from her.
Mrs. Weasley fell back against her husband and watched Fleur mopping up
Bill’s wounds with a most curious expression upon her face. Nobody said
anything; Harry did not dare move. Like everybody else, he was waiting for
the explosion.
“Our Great-Auntie Muriel,” said Mrs. Weasley after a long pause, “has a

“We must follow the rules, and the rules state clearly that those people
whose names come out of the Goblet of Fire are bound to compete in the
tournament.”
“Well, Barty knows the rule book back to front,” said Bagman, beaming
and turning back to Karkaroff and Madame Maxime, as though the matter
was now closed.
“I insist upon resubmitting the names of the rest of my students,” saidKarkaroff. He had dropped his unctuous tone and his smile now. His face
wore a very ugly look indeed. “You will set up the Goblet of Fire once more,
and we will continue adding names until each school has two champions. It’s
only fair, Dumbledore.”
“But Karkaroff, it doesn’t work like that,” said Bagman. “The Goblet of
Fire’s just gone out — it won’t reignite until the start of the next tournament
—”
“— in which Durmstrang will most certainly not be competing!” exploded
Karkaroff. “After all our meetings and negotiations and compromises, I little
expected something of this nature to occur! I h edore made a small noise of dissent through his long, crooked nose.
“Ah, I was forgetting . . . you don’t like the dementors, do you, Albus?”
said Moody with a sardonic smile.“No,” said Dumbledore calmly, “I’m afraid I don’t. I have long felt the
Ministry is wrong to ally itself with such creatures.”
“But for filth like this . . .” Moody said softly.
“You say you have names for us, Karkaroff,” said Mr. Crouch. “Let us hear
them, please.”
“You must understand,” said Karkaroff hurriedly, “that He-Who-Must-Not-
Be-Named operated always in the greatest secrecy. . . . He preferred that we
— I mean to say, his supporters — and I regret now, very deeply, that I ever
counted myself among them —”
“Get on with it,” sneered Moody.
“— we never knew the names of every one of our fellows — He alone
knew exactly who we all were —”
“Which was a wise move, wasn’t it, as it prevented someone like you,
Karkaroff, from turning all of them in,” muttered Moody.
“Yet you say you have 
some
 names for us?” said Mr. Crouch.
“I — I do hat’s
why Kreacher won’t take orders from her — he’s supposed to do whatever
anyone in the family asks him . . .”
“You and Tonks are related?” Harry asked, surprised.
“Oh yeah, her mother, Andromeda, was my favorite cousin,” said Sirius,
examining the tapestry carefully. “No, Andromeda’s not on here either, look
—”
He pointed to another small round burn mark between two names, Bellatrix
and Narcissa.
“Andromeda’s sisters are still here because they made lovely, respectable
pure-blood marriages, but Andromeda married a Muggle-born, Ted Tonks, so
—”
Sirius mimed blasting the tapestry with a wand and laughed sourly. Harry,
however, did not laugh; he was too busy staring at the names to the right of
Andromeda’s burn mark. A double line of gold embroidery linked NarcissaBlack with Lucius Malfoy, and a single vertical gold line from their names led
to the name Draco.
“You’re related to the Malfoys!”
“The pure-blood families are all interrelated,” said Sirius. “If you’re only
going to let your sons and daughters mar  matter, however. I have all their names here, MissParkinson ran into the Room of Requirement for me to see if they had left
anything behind. . . . We needed evidence and the room provided . . .”
And to Harry’s horror, she withdrew from her pocket the list of names that
had been pinned upon the Room of Requirement’s wall and handed it to
Fudge.
“The moment I saw Potter’s name on the list, I knew what we were dealing
with,” she said softly.
“Excellent,” said Fudge, a smile spreading across his face. “Excellent,
Dolores. And . . . by thunder . . .”
He looked up at Dumbledore, who was still standing beside Marietta, his
wand held loosely in his hand.
“See what they’ve named themselves?” said Fudge quietly. 
“Dumbledore’s
Army.”
Dumbledore reached out and took the piece of parchment from Fudge. He
gazed at the heading scribbled by Hermione months before and for a moment
seemed unable to speak. Then he looked up, smiling.
“Well, the game is up,” he said simply. “Would you like a written
confession from me, Corneli ablishments dedicated to the Dark Arts had been created since his last visit.
Harry’s own face glared down at him from posters plastered over many
windows, always captioned with the words 
UNDESIRABLE NUMBER ONE
.
A number of ragged people sat huddled in doorways. He heard them
moaning to the few passersby, pleading for gold, insisting that they were
really wizards. One man had a bloody bandage over his eye.
As they set off along the street, the beggars glimpsed Hermione. They
seemed to melt away before her, drawing hoods over their faces and fleeing as
fast as they could. Hermione looked after them curiously, until the man with
the bloodied bandage came staggering right across her path.
“My children!” he bellowed, pointing at her. His voice was cracked, high-
pitched; he sounded distraught. “Where are my children? What has he done
with them? You know, 
you know
!”
“I — I really —” stammered Hermione.
The man lunged at her, reaching for her throat: Then, with a bang and a
burst of red light he was thrown back ld have forced Albus to reveal how great and sincere that fear
was.
Harry crouched down so that Albus’s face was slightly above his own.
Alone of Harry’s three children, Albus had inherited Lily’s eyes.
“Albus Severus,” Harry said quietly, so that nobody but Ginny could hear,
and she was tactful enough to pretend to be waving to Rose, who was now on
the train, “you were named for two headmasters of Hogwarts. One of them
was a Slytherin and he was probably the bravest man I ever knew.”“But 
just say —
”
“— then Slytherin House will have gained an excellent student, won’t it? It
doesn’t matter to us, Al. But if it matters to you, you’ll be able to choose
Gryffindor over Slytherin. The Sorting Hat takes your choice into account.”
“Really?”
“It did for me,” said Harry.
He had never told any of his children that before, and he saw the wonder in
Albus’s face when he said it. But now the doors were slamming all along the
scarlet train, and the blurred outlines of parents were swarming forward for
final kisses, last-  had Stunned young Crouch. “Harry is as
sane as you or I. That scar upon his forehead has not addled his brains. I
believe it hurts him when Lord Voldemort is close by, or feeling particularly
murderous.”
Fudge had taken half a step back from Dumbledore, but he looked no less
stubborn.
“You’ll forgive me, Dumbledore, but I’ve never heard of a curse scar acting
as an alarm bell before. . . .”
“Look, I saw Voldemort come back!” Harry shouted. He tried to get out of
bed again, but Mrs. Weasley forced him back. “I saw the Death Eaters! I cangive you their names! Lucius Malfoy —”
Snape made a sudden movement, but as Harry looked at him, Snape’s eyes
flew back to Fudge.
“Malfoy was cleared!” said Fudge, visibly affronted. “A very old family —
donations to excellent causes —”
“Macnair!” Harry continued.
“Also cleared! Now working for the Ministry!”
“Avery — Nott — Crabbe — Goyle —”
“You are merely repeating the names of those who were acquitted of being
Death Eaters thirteen years ago!” said Fudge angrily. “You coul the two fights,
Voldemort and his three opponents, Bellatrix and Molly, and Harry stood,
invisible, torn between both, wanting to attack and yet to protect, unable to be
sure that he would not hit the innocent.
“What will happen to your children when I’ve killed you?” taunted
Bellatrix, as mad as her master, capering as Molly’s curses danced around her.
“When Mummy’s gone the same way as Freddie?”
“You — will — never — touch — our — children — again!” screamed
Mrs. Weasley.
Bellatrix laughed, the same exhilarated laugh her cousin Sirius had given as
he toppled backward through the veil, and suddenly Harry knew what was
going to happen before it did.
Molly’s curse soared beneath Bellatrix’s outstretched arm and hit her
squarely in the chest, directly over her heart.
Bellatrix’s gloating smile froze, her eyes seemed to bulge: For the tiniest
space of time she knew what had happened, and then she toppled, and the
watching crowd roared, and Voldemort screamed.Harry felt as though he turned in slow motion; he saw "
What is the name of the wand shop in Diagon Alley?,Ollivanders,The wand shop in Diagon Alley is Ollivander's.,"t Harry
could see through the dusty shop window was definitely not Diagon Alley.
The sooner he got out of here, the better. Nose still stinging where it had hit
the hearth, Harry made his way swiftly and silently toward the door, but
before he’d got halfway toward it, two people appeared on the other side of
the glass — and one of them was the very last person Harry wanted to meet
when he was lost, covered in soot, and wearing broken glasses: Draco Malfoy.
Harry looked quickly around and spotted a large black cabinet to his left;
he shot inside it and pulled the doors closed, leaving a small crack to peer
through. Seconds later, a bell clanged, and Malfoy stepped into the shop.
The man who followed could only be Draco’s father. He had the same pale,
pointed face and identical cold, gray eyes. Mr. Malfoy crossed the shop,
looking lazily at the items on display, and rang a bell on the counter before
turning to his son and saying, “Touch nothing, Draco.”
Malfoy, who had reached for the glass eye, said, “I though . He was a good man,
Florean.”
“Talking of Diagon Alley,” said Mr. Weasley, “looks like Ollivander’s gone
too.”
“The wandmaker?” said Ginny, looking startled.
“That’s the one. Shop’s empty. No sign of a struggle. No one knows
whether he left voluntarily or was kidnapped.”
“But wands — what’ll people do for wands?”
“They’ll make do with other makers,” said Lupin. “But Ollivander was the
best, and if the other side have got him it’s not so good for us.”
The day after this rather gloomy birthday tea, their letters and booklists
arrived from Hogwarts. Harry’s included a surprise: He had been made
Quidditch Captain.
“That gives you equal status with prefects!” cried Hermione happily. “You
can use our special bathroom now and everything!”
“Wow, I remember when Charlie wore one of these,” said Ron, examining
the badge with glee. “Harry, this is so cool, you’re my Captain — if you let
me back on the team, I suppose, ha ha. . . .”“Well, I don’t suppose we can put off a trip to Diagon Alley much longer
now you’ve got t , if it’s really true they’ve got
premises in Diagon Alley now, they must have been planning this for
ages . . .”
“Yeah, but that’s another thing, how did they get premises?” said Ron,
hitting his teacup so hard with his wand that its legs collapsed again and it lay
twitching before him. “It’s a bit dodgy, isn’t it? They’ll need loads of
Galleons to afford the rent on a place in Diagon Alley, she’ll want to know
what they’ve been up to, to get their hands on that sort of gold . . .”
“Well, yes, that occurred to me too,” said Hermione, allowing her teacup to
jog in neat little circles around Harry’s, whose stubby little legs were still
unable to touch the desktop. “I’ve been wondering whether Mundungus has
persuaded them to sell stolen goods or something awful . . .”
“He hasn’t,” said Harry curtly.
“How do you know?” said Ron and Hermione together.“Because —” Harry hesitated, but the moment to confess finally seemed to
have come. There was no good to be gained in keeping silent if it meant
anyone suspected tha at’s your Quidditch team?” Ron asked.“Er — I don’t know any,” Harry confessed.
“What!” Ron looked dumbfounded. “Oh, you wait, it’s the best game in the
world —” And he was off, explaining all about the four balls and the
positions of the seven players, describing famous games he’d been to with his
brothers and the broomstick he’d like to get if he had the money. He was just
taking Harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door
slid open yet again, but it wasn’t Neville the toadless boy, or Hermione
Granger this time.
Three boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle one at once: It was
the pale boy from Madam Malkin’s robe shop. He was looking at Harry with
a lot more interest than he’d shown back in Diagon Alley.
“Is it true?” he said. “They’re saying all down the train that Harry Potter’s
in this compartment. So it’s you, is it?”
“Yes,” said Harry. He was looking at the other boys. Both of them were
thickset and looked extremely mean. Standing on either side of the pale boy,
they loo step down Knockturn
Alley!” she shouted at the twins’ retreating backs.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione strolled off along the winding, cobbled street.
The bag of gold, silver, and bronze jangling cheerfully in Harry’s pocket was
clamoring to be spent, so he bought three large strawberry-and-peanut-butter
ice creams, which they slurped happily as they wandered up the alley,
examining the fascinating shop windows. Ron gazed longingly at a full set of
Chudley Cannon robes in the windows of Quality Quidditch Supplies until
Hermione dragged them off to buy ink and parchment next door. In Gambol
and Japes Wizarding Joke Shop, they met Fred, George, and Lee Jordan, who
were stocking up on Dr. Filibuster’s Fabulous Wet-Start, No-Heat Fireworks,
and in a tiny junk shop full of broken wands, lopsided brass scales, and old
cloaks covered in potion stains they found Percy, deeply immersed in a small
and deeply boring book called 
Prefects Who Gained Power
.
“A study of Hogwarts prefects and their later careers,”
 Ron read alou leased to go.
Finally, Harry was the only passenger left.
“Right then, Neville,” said Stan, clapping his hands, “whereabouts in
London?”
“Diagon Alley,” said Harry.
“Righto,” said Stan. “’Old tight, then . . .”
BANG!
They were thundering along Charing Cross Road. Harry sat up and
watched buildings and benches squeezing themselves out of the Knight Bus’s
way. The sky was getting a little lighter. He would lie low for a couple of
hours, go to Gringotts the moment it opened, then set off — where, he didn’t
know.
Ern slammed on the brakes and the Knight Bus skidded to a halt in front of
a small and shabby-looking pub, the Leaky Cauldron, behind which lay the
magical entrance to Diagon Alley.“Thanks,” Harry said to Ern.
He jumped down the steps and helped Stan lower his trunk and Hedwig’s
cage onto the pavement.
“Well,” said Harry. “’Bye then!”
But Stan wasn’t paying attention. Still standing in the doorway to the bus,
he was goggling at the shadowy entrance to the Leaky Cauldron.
“
There
 you are, Harry,” said a  .
and Mrs. Weasley; Bill supported by Fleur and followed by Fred and George,
who were wearing jackets of black dragon skin. Then there was Madame
Maxime, who took up two and a half chairs on her own; Tom, the landlord of
the Leaky Cauldron in London; Arabella Figg, Harry’s Squib neighbor; the
hairy bass player from the Wizarding group the Weird Sisters; Ernie Prang,
driver of the Knight Bus; Madam Malkin, of the robe shop in Diagon Alley;
and some people whom Harry merely knew by sight, such as the barman of
the Hog’s Head and the witch who pushed the trolley on the Hogwarts
Express. The castle ghosts were there too, barely visible in the bright sunlight,
discernible only when they moved, shimmering insubstantially on the
gleaming air.Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny filed into seats at the end of a row beside
the lake. People were whispering to each other; it sounded like a breeze in the
grass, but the birdsong was louder by far. The crowd continued to swell; with
a great rush of affection for both of them, H he cardboard box.
When he had finished, he turned to Dumbledore and said baldly, “I haven’t
got any money.”
“That is easily remedied,” said Dumbledore, drawing a leather money-
pouch from his pocket. “There is a fund at Hogwarts for those who require
assistance to buy books and robes. You might have to buy some of your
spellbooks and so on secondhand, but —”
“Where do you buy spellbooks?” interrupted Riddle, who had taken the
heavy money bag without thanking Dumbledore, and was now examining a
fat gold Galleon.
“In Diagon Alley,” said Dumbledore. “I have your list of books and schoolequipment with me. I can help you find everything —”
“You’re coming with me?” asked Riddle, looking up.
“Certainly, if you —”
“I don’t need you,” said Riddle. “I’m used to doing things for myself, I go
round London on my own all the time. How do you get to this Diagon Alley
— sir?” he added, catching Dumbledore’s eye.
Harry thought that Dumbledore would insist upon accompanying Riddle,
but once again he was surprised. Dumbledore h"
Who is the head of Slytherin House?,Severus Snape,Salazar Slytherin is the head of Slytherin House.,"aw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall
full of people craning to get a good look at him. Next second he was looking
at the black inside of the hat. He waited.
“Hmm,” said a small voice in his ear. “Difficult. Very difficult. Plenty of
courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There’s talent, oh my goodness, yes —
and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that’s interesting. . . . So where shall I
put you?”
Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, 
Not Slytherin, not
Slytherin.
“Not Slytherin, eh?” said the small voice. “Are you sure? You could be
great, you know, it’s all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the
way to greatness, no doubt about that — no? Well, if you’re sure — better be
GRYFFINDOR!”
Harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall. He took off the
hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table. He was so relieved to
have been chosen and not put in Slytherin, he hardly noticed that he was
getting the loudest cheer yet. Percy the Prefect got up and  ch a foolish story! We will return, if you
please, to 
history,
 to solid, believable, verifiable 
fact
!”
And within five minutes, the class had sunk back into its usual torpor.
“I always knew Salazar Slytherin was a twisted old loony,” Ron told Harry
and Hermione as they fought their way through the teeming corridors at the
end of the lesson to drop off their bags before dinner. “But I never knew he
started all this pure-blood stuff. I wouldn’t be in his House if you paid me.
Honestly, if the Sorting Hat had tried to put me in Slytherin, I’d’ve got the
train straight back home. . . .”
Hermione nodded fervently, but Harry didn’t say anything. His stomach
had just dropped unpleasantly.
Harry had never told Ron and Hermione that the Sorting Hat had seriously
considered putting 
him
 in Slytherin. He could remember, as though it were
yesterday, the small voice that had spoken in his ear when he’d placed the hat
on his head a year before: 
You could be great, you know, it’s all here in your
head, and Slytherin w ontinued.
“For a few years, the founders worked in harmony together, seeking out
youngsters who showed signs of magic and bringing them to the castle to be
educated. But then disagreements sprang up between them. A rift began to
grow between Slytherin and the others. Slytherin wished to be more 
selective
about the students admitted to Hogwarts. He believed that magical learning
should be kept within all-magic families. He disliked taking students ofMuggle parentage, believing them to be untrustworthy. After a while, there
was a serious argument on the subject between Slytherin and Gryffindor, and
Slytherin left the school.”
Professor Binns paused again, pursing his lips, looking like a wrinkled old
tortoise.
“Reliable historical sources tell us this much,” he said. “But these honest
facts have been obscured by the fanciful legend of the Chamber of Secrets.
The story goes that Slytherin had built a hidden chamber in the castle, of
which the other founders knew nothing.
“Slytherin, according to the legend, sea rom a doorway to the right — the
rest of the school must already be here — but Professor McGonagall showed
the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in,
standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering
about nervously.
“Welcome to Hogwarts,” said Professor McGonagall. “The start-of-term
banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall,
you will be sorted into your Houses. The Sorting is a very importantceremony because, while you are here, your House will be something like
your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your
House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free time in your House
common room.
“The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and
Slytherin. Each House has its own noble history and each has produced
outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs
will earn your House points, while any rule-breaking will lose House points.
At the end of the use
Lord Voldemort — 
who 
is
 the last remaining descendant of Salazar Slytherin
— 
can speak Parseltongue. Unless I’m much mistaken, he transferred some of
his own powers to you the night he gave you that scar. Not something he
intended to do, I’m sure. . . .”
“Voldemort put a bit of himself in 
me
?” Harry said, thunderstruck.
“It certainly seems so.”
“So I 
should 
be in Slytherin,” Harry said, looking desperately into
Dumbledore’s face. “The Sorting Hat could see Slytherin’s power in me, and
it —”
“Put you in Gryffindor,” said Dumbledore calmly. “Listen to me, Harry.
You happen to have many qualities Salazar Slytherin prized in his hand-
picked students. His own very rare gift, Parseltongue — 
resourcefulness —
determination — 
a certain disregard for rules,” he added, his mustache
quivering again. “Yet the Sorting Hat placed you in Gryffindor. You know
why that was. Think.”
“It only put me in Gryffindor,” said Harry in a defeated voice, “because I
asked not to go in Slytherin. . . .”
“Exactly,”
 said Du suppress the exhilaration in his voice.
“This is it! We’re off to Hogwarts!”
She nodded, mopping her eyes, but in spite of herself, she half smiled.
“You’d better be in Slytherin,” said Snape, encouraged that she had
brightened a little.
“Slytherin?”
One of the boys sharing the compartment, who had shown no interest at all
in Lily or Snape until that point, looked around at the word, and Harry, whose
attention had been focused entirely on the two beside the window, saw his
father: slight, black-haired like Snape, but with that indefinable air of having
been well-cared-for, even adored, that Snape so conspicuously lacked.
“Who wants to be in Slytherin? I think I’d leave, wouldn’t you?” James
asked the boy lounging on the seats opposite him, and with a jolt, Harry
realized that it was Sirius. Sirius did not smile.“My whole family have been in Slytherin,” he said.
“Blimey,” said James, “and I thought you seemed all right!”
Sirius grinned.
“Maybe I’ll break the tradition. Where are you heading, if you’ve got the
  long line
of scared-looking first years filing into the Hall. Ginny was among them,
easily visible because of her vivid Weasley hair. Meanwhile, Professor
McGonagall, a bespectacled witch with her hair in a tight bun, was placing
the famous Hogwarts Sorting Hat on a stool before the newcomers.
Every year, this aged old hat, patched, frayed, and dirty, sorted new
students into the four Hogwarts Houses (Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw,
and Slytherin). Harry well remembered putting it on, exactly one year ago,and waiting, petrified, for its decision as it muttered aloud in his ear. For a
few horrible seconds he had feared that the hat was going to put him in
Slytherin, the House that had turned out more Dark witches and wizards than
any other — but he had ended up in Gryffindor, along with Ron, Hermione,
and the rest of the Weasleys. Last term, Harry and Ron had helped Gryffindor
win the House Championship, beating Slytherin for the first time in seven
years.
A very small, mousy-haired boy had been called for rops the
Quaffle and Katie Bell — er — drops it too — so that’s Montague with theQuaffle, Slytherin Captain Montague takes the Quaffle, and he’s off up the
pitch, come on now Gryffindor, block him!”
Harry zoomed around the end of the stadium behind the Slytherin goal
hoops, willing himself not to look at what was going on at Ron’s end; as he
sped past the Slytherin Keeper, he heard Bletchley singing along with the
crowd below,
 
WEASLEY CANNOT SAVE A THING . . .
 
“— and Pucey’s dodged Alicia again, and he’s heading straight for goal,
stop it, Ron!”
Harry did not have to look to see what had happened: There was a terrible
groan from the Gryffindor end, coupled with fresh screams and applause from
the Slytherins. Looking down, Harry saw the pug-faced Pansy Parkinson right
at the front of the stands, her back to the pitch as she conducted the Slytherin
supporters who were roaring:
 
THAT’S WHY SLYTHERINS ALL SING:
WEASLEY IS OUR KING.

“Luck can only get you so far, Harry. The situation with Slughorn was
different; you always had the ability to persuade him, you just needed to
tweak the circumstances a bit. Luck isn’t enough to get you through a
powerful enchantment, though. Don’t go wasting the rest of that potion!
You’ll need all the luck you can get if Dumbledore takes you along with him
. . .” She dropped her voice to a whisper.
“Couldn’t we make some more?” Ron asked Harry, ignoring Hermione.
“It’d be great to have a stock of it. . . . Have a look in the book . . .”
Harry pulled his copy of 
Advanced Potion-Making
 out of his bag and
looked up Felix Felicis.
“Blimey, it’s seriously complicated,” he said, running an eye down the list
of ingredients. “And it takes six months . . . You’ve got to let it stew. . . .”
“Typical,” said Ron.
Harry was about to put his book away again when he noticed the corner of
a page folded down; turning to it, he saw the 
Sectumsempra
 spell, captioned
“For Enemies,” that he had  way, please, Harry,” said Dumbledore. He raised his wand and
made complicated movements over the surface of the potion, murmuring
soundlessly. Nothing happened, except perhaps that the potion glowed a little
brighter. Harry remained silent while Dumbledore worked, but after a while
Dumbledore withdrew his wand, and Harry felt it was safe to talk again.
“You think the Horcrux is in there, sir?”
“Oh yes.” Dumbledore peered more closely into the basin. Harry saw his
face reflected, upside down, in the smooth surface of the green potion. “But
how to reach it? This potion cannot be penetrated by hand, Vanished, parted,
scooped up, or siphoned away, nor can it be Transfigured, Charmed, or
otherwise made to change its nature.”
Almost absentmindedly, Dumbledore raised his wand again, twirled it once
in midair, and then caught the crystal goblet that he had conjured out of
nowhere.
“I can only conclude that this potion is supposed to be drunk.”
“What?” said Harry. “No!”
“Yes, I think so: Only by drinking it can I emp e air. But no . . . their last hope was gone.
“What we need,” said Dumbledore slowly, and his light blue eyes moved
from Harry to Hermione, “is more 
time.
”
“But —” Hermione began. And then her eyes became very round. “OH!”
“Now, pay attention,” said Dumbledore, speaking very low, and very
clearly. “Sirius is locked in Professor Flitwick’s office on the seventh floor.
Thirteenth window from the right of the West Tower. If all goes well, you will
be able to save more than one innocent life tonight. But remember this, both
of you: 
You must not be seen.
 Miss Granger, you know the law — you know
what is at stake. . . . 
You — must — not — be — seen.
”
Harry didn’t have a clue what was going on. Dumbledore had turned on his
heel and looked back as he reached the door.
“I am going to lock you in. It is —” he consulted his watch, “five minutes
to midnight. Miss Granger, three turns should do it. Good luck.”
“Good luck?” Harry repeated as the door closed behind Dumbledore.
“Three turns? What’s he talking about? Wh em concerned with potion-making. Here
and there were directions for what looked like spells that the Prince had made
up himself.
“Or herself,” said Hermione irritably, overhearing Harry pointing some of
these out to Ron in the common room on Saturday evening. “It might have
been a girl. I think the handwriting looks more like a girl’s than a boy’s.”“The Half-Blood 
Prince,
 he was called,” Harry said. “How many girls have
been Princes?”
Hermione seemed to have no answer to this. She merely scowled and
twitched her essay on 
The Principles of Rematerialization
 away from Ron,
who was trying to read it upside down.
Harry looked at his watch and hurriedly put the old copy of 
Advanced
Potion-Making
 back into his bag.
“It’s five to eight, I’d better go, I’ll be late for Dumbledore.”
“Ooooh!” gasped Hermione, looking up at once. “Good luck! We’ll wait
up, we want to hear what he teaches you!”
“Hope it goes okay,” said Ron, and the pair of them watched Harry leave
through the portrait hole.
Harry proceeded through letely clear potion. Harry stared at it.
“Do you know what this is, Potter?” Snape said, his eyes glittering
dangerously again.
“No,” said Harry, with complete honesty this time.
“It is Veritaserum — a Truth Potion so powerful that three drops would
have you spilling your innermost secrets for this entire class to hear,” said
Snape viciously. “Now, the use of this potion is controlled by very strict
Ministry guidelines. But unless you watch your step, you might just find that
my hand 
slips
” — he shook the crystal bottle slightly — “right over your
evening pumpkin juice. And then, Potter . . . then we’ll find out whether
you’ve been in my office or not.”
Harry said nothing. He turned back to his ginger roots once more, picked
up his knife, and started slicing them again. He didn’t like the sound of thatTruth Potion at all, nor would he put it past Snape to slip him some. He
repressed a shudder at the thought of what might come spilling out of his
mouth if Snape did it . . . quite apart from landing a whole l ply cause a powerful infatuation
or obsession. It is probably the most dangerous and powerful potion in this
room — oh yes,” he said, nodding gravely at Malfoy and Nott, both of whom
were smirking skeptically. “When you have seen as much of life as I have,
you will not underestimate the power of obsessive love. . . .
“And now,” said Slughorn, “it is time for us to start work.”
“Sir, you haven’t told us what’s in this one,” said Ernie Macmillan,
pointing at a small black cauldron standing on Slughorn’s desk. The potion
within was splashing about merrily; it was the color of molten gold, and large
drops were leaping like goldfish above the surface, though not a particle had
spilled.
“Oho,” said Slughorn again. Harry was sure that Slughorn had not
forgotten the potion at all, but had waited to be asked for dramatic effect.
“Yes. That. Well, 
that
 one, ladies and gentlemen, is a most curious little
potion called Felix Felicis. I take it,” he turned, smiling, to look at Hermione,
who had let out an audible gasp,  rful curse, like the one on that
necklace, within seconds. But something that’s just been put in the wrong
bottle wouldn’t register — and anyway, love potions aren’t Dark or dangerous
—”
“Easy for you to say,” muttered Harry, thinking of Romilda Vane.
“— so it would be down to Filch to realize it wasn’t a cough potion, and
he’s not a very good wizard, I doubt he can tell one potion from —”
Hermione stopped dead; Harry had heard it too. Somebody had moved
close behind them among the dark bookshelves. They waited, and a momentlater the vulturelike countenance of Madam Pince appeared around the corner,
her sunken cheeks, her skin like parchment, and her long hooked nose
illuminated unflatteringly by the lamp she was carrying.
“The library is now closed,” she said. “Mind you return anything you have
borrowed to the correct — 
what have you been doing to that book, you
depraved boy?
”
“It isn’t the library’s, it’s mine!” said Harry hastily, snatching his copy of
Advanced Potion-Making
 off the table as she lunged  your cheek,
Potter.”
Things didn’t improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson continued.
Snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to
cure boils. He swept around in his long black cloak, watching them weigh
dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticizing almost everyone except
Malfoy, whom he seemed to like. He was just telling everyone to look at the
perfect way Malfoy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of acid green
smoke and a loud hissing filled the dungeon. Neville had somehow managed
to melt Seamus’s cauldron into a twisted blob, and their potion was seeping
across the stone floor, burning holes in people’s shoes. Within seconds, the
whole class was standing on their stools while Neville, who had been
drenched in the potion when the cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry
red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs.
“Idiot boy!” snarled Snape, clearing the spilled potion away with one wave
of his wand. “I suppose you added the porcupine quills before tak"

fast, Harry heard Snape walking away down the corridor; Filch handed
Moody the egg and disappeared from view too, muttering to Mrs. Norris.
“Never mind, my sweet . . . we’ll see Dumbledore in the morning . . . tell him
what Peeves was up to. . . .”
A door slammed. Harry was left staring down at Moody, who placed his
staff on the bottommost stair and started to climb laboriously toward him, a
dull 
clunk
 on every other step.“Close shave, Potter,” he muttered.
“Yeah . . . I — er . . . thanks,” said Harry weakly.
“What is this thing?” said Moody, drawing the Marauder’s Map out of his
pocket and unfolding it.
“Map of Hogwarts,” said Harry, hoping Moody was going to pull him out
of the staircase soon; his leg was really hurting him.
“Merlin’s beard,” Moody whispered, staring at the map, his magical eye
going haywire. “This . . . this is some map, Potter!”
“Yeah, it’s . . . quite useful,” Harry said. His eyes were starting to water
from the pain. “Er — Professor   master guessed that he was heading for Hogwarts. My father was going to
tell Dumbledore everything, to confess. He was going to admit that he had
smuggled me from Azkaban.
“My master sent me word of my father’s escape. He told me to stop him at
all costs. So I waited and watched. I used the map I had taken from Harry
Potter. The map that had almost ruined everything.”
“Map?” said Dumbledore quickly. “What map is this?”
“Potter’s map of Hogwarts. Potter saw me on it. Potter saw me stealing
more ingredients for the Polyjuice Potion from Snape’s office one night. He
thought I was my father. We have the same first name. I took the map from
Potter that night. I told him my father hated Dark wizards. Potter believed my
father was after Snape.
“For a week I waited for my father to arrive at Hogwarts. At last, one
evening, the map showed my father entering the grounds. I pulled on my
Invisibility Cloak and went down to meet him. He was walking around the
edge of the forest. Then Potter came, and Krum. I waited. I co no
interruption. “Come on, last time we went you didn’t see anything. You
haven’t even been inside Zonko’s yet!”
Harry looked around to check that Hermione was well out of earshot.
“Okay,” he said. “But I’m taking the Invisibility Cloak this time.”
On Saturday morning, Harry packed his Invisibility Cloak in his bag, slipped
the Marauder’s Map into his pocket, and went down to breakfast with
everyone else. Hermione kept shooting suspicious looks down the table at
him, but he avoided her eye and was careful to let her see him walking back
up the marble staircase in the entrance hall as everybody else proceeded to the
front doors.
“’Bye!” Harry called to Ron. “See you when you get back!”
Ron grinned and winked.Harry hurried up to the third floor, slipping the Marauder’s Map out of his
pocket as he went. Crouching behind the one-eyed witch, he smoothed it out.
A tiny dot was moving in his direction. Harry squinted at it. The minuscule
writing next to it read 
Neville Longbottom.
Harry quickly pulled out his wand, hed up the stairs
and into his dormitory, where he flung open his trunk and pulled out the
Marauder’s Map and a pair of balled-up socks. Then he sped back down the
stairs and into the common room, skidding to a halt where Ron and Hermione
sat, looking stunned.
“I’ve got to be quick,” Harry panted. “Dumbledore thinks I’m getting my
Invisibility Cloak. Listen. . . .”
Quickly he told them where he was going and why. He did not pause either
for Hermione’s gasps of horror or for Ron’s hasty questions; they could work
out the finer details for themselves later.
“. . . so you see what this means?” Harry finished at a gallop. “Dumbledorewon’t be here tonight, so Malfoy’s going to have another clear shot at
whatever he’s up to. 
No, listen to me!
” he hissed angrily, as both Ron and
Hermione showed every sign of interrupting. “I know it was Malfoy
celebrating in the Room of Requirement. Here —” 
He shoved the Marauder’s
Map into Hermione’s hands. “You’ve got to watch him and you’ve got to
watch Snape too. Use anyone e ” said Harry. He dropped his voice so that none of the
sixth years could hear him and told them all about the Marauder’s Map.
“How come Fred and George never gave it to 
me
!”
 
said Ron, outraged.
“I’m their brother!”
“But Harry isn’t going to keep it!” said Hermione, as though the idea were
ludicrous. “He’s going to hand it in to Professor McGonagall, aren’t you,
Harry?”
“No, I’m not!” said Harry.
“Are you mad?” said Ron, goggling at Hermione. “Hand in something that
good?”
“If I hand it in, I’ll have to say where I got it! Filch would know Fred and
George had nicked it!”
“But what about Sirius Black?” Hermione hissed. “He could be using one
of the passages on that map to get into the castle! The teachers have got to
know!”
“He can’t be getting in through a passage,” said Harry quickly. “There are
seven secret tunnels on the map, right? Fred and George reckon Filch already
knows about four of them. And of the other three — one of them’s caved in,
so no one can get through it. One of them’s got the Whomping  Invisibility Cloak and
throwing it over both of them. He gave the wall a little push.
It melted away at his touch and they slipped outside: Harry glanced back
and saw that it had resealed itself at once. They were standing in a dark
corridor: Harry pulled Luna back into the shadows, fumbled in the pouch
around his neck, and took out the Marauder’s Map. Holding it close to his
nose he searched, and located his and Luna’s dots at last.
“We’re up on the fifth floor,” he whispered, watching Filch moving away
from them, a corridor ahead. “Come on, this way.”
They crept off.
Harry had prowled the castle at night many times before, but never had his
heart hammered this fast, never had so much depended on his safe passage
through the place. Through squares of moonlight upon the floor, past suits of
armor whose helmets creaked at the sound of their soft footsteps, around
corners beyond which who knew what lurked, Harry and Luna walked,
checking the Marauder’s Map whenever light permitted, twice pausing toallow a ghost might try and sneak out of the castle
to visit Hagrid before his hippogriff was executed. And I was right, wasn’t I?”
He had started to pace up and down, looking at them. Little patches of dust
rose at his feet.
“You might have been wearing your father’s old Cloak, Harry —”“How d’you know about the Cloak?”
“The number of times I saw James disappearing under it . . . ,” said Lupin,
waving an impatient hand again. “The point is, even if you’re wearing an
Invisibility Cloak, you still show up on the Marauder’s Map. I watched you
cross the grounds and enter Hagrid’s hut. Twenty minutes later, you left
Hagrid, and set off back toward the castle. But you were now accompanied by
somebody else.”
“What?” said Harry. “No, we weren’t!”
“I couldn’t believe my eyes,” said Lupin, still pacing, and ignoring Harry’s
interruption. “I thought the map must be malfunctioning. How could he be
with you?”
“No one was with us!” said Harry.
“And then I saw another dot, moving fast toward you, labeled 
Sirius
Black
. . . . I saw him c  hand moved toward the fire.
“No!” Harry said quickly.
“So!” said Snape, his long nostrils quivering. “Is this another treasured gift
from Mr. Weasley? Or is it — something else? A letter, perhaps, written in
invisible ink? Or — instructions to get into Hogsmeade without passing the
dementors?”
Harry blinked. Snape’s eyes gleamed.
“Let me see, let me see . . . ,” he muttered, taking out his wand and
smoothing the map out on his desk. “Reveal your secret!” he said, touching
the wand to the parchment.
Nothing happened. Harry clenched his hands to stop them from shaking.
“Show yourself!” Snape said, tapping the map sharply.
It stayed blank. Harry was taking deep, calming breaths.
“Professor Severus Snape, master of this school, commands you to yield
the information you conceal!” Snape said, hitting the map with his wand.As though an invisible hand were writing upon it, words appeared on the
smooth surface of the map.
“Mr. Moony presents his compliments to Professor Snape, and begs him to
keep his abnormally larg"
Who is the Triwizard champion from Beauxbatons?,Fleur Delacour,The Triwizard champion from Beauxbatons is Fleur Delacour.,"oke. Nearly everyone laughed, and Dumbledore chuckled appreciatively.
“I am 
not
 joking, Mr. Weasley,” he said, “though now that you mention it, I
did hear an excellent one over the summer about a troll, a hag, and a
leprechaun who all go into a bar . . .”
Professor McGonagall cleared her throat loudly.
“Er — but maybe this is not the time . . . no . . .” said Dumbledore, “where
was I? Ah yes, the Triwizard Tournament . . . well, some of you will not know
what this tournament involves, so I hope those who 
do
 know will forgive me
for giving a short explanation, and allow their attention to wander freely.
“The Triwizard Tournament was first established some seven hundred years
ago as a friendly competition between the three largest European schools of
wizardry: Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, and Durmstrang. A champion was selected
to represent each school, and the three champions competed in three magical
tasks. The schools took it in turns to host the tournament once every five
years, and it was generally agreed to nde hair, and swept
up between the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables.
“Oh look, they’re all disappointed,” Hermione said over the noise, nodding
toward the remainder of the Beauxbatons party. “Disappointed” was a bit of
an understatement, Harry thought. Two of the girls who had not been selected
had dissolved into tears and were sobbing with their heads on their arms.
When Fleur Delacour too had vanished into the side chamber, silence fell
again, but this time it was a silence so stiff with excitement you could almost
taste it. The Hogwarts champion next . . .
And the Goblet of Fire turned red once more; sparks showered out of it; the
tongue of flame shot high into the air, and from its tip Dumbledore pulled the
third piece of parchment.
“The Hogwarts champion,” he called, “is Cedric Diggory!”
“No!” said Ron loudly, but nobody heard him except Harry; the uproar
from the next table was too great. Every single Hufflepuff had jumped to his
or her feet, screaming and stamping, as Cedric made his way past them,
grin ment and held it at arm’s length, so
that he could read it by the light of the flames, which had turned back to blue-
white.
“The champion for Durmstrang,” he read, in a strong, clear voice, “will be
Viktor Krum.”
“No surprises there!” yelled Ron as a storm of applause and cheering swept
the Hall. Harry saw Viktor Krum rise from the Slytherin table and slouch up
toward Dumbledore; he turned right, walked along the staff table, and
disappeared through the door into the next chamber.
“Bravo, Viktor!” boomed Karkaroff, so loudly that everyone could hear
him, even over all the applause. “Knew you had it in you!”
The clapping and chatting died down. Now everyone’s attention was
focused again on the goblet, which, seconds later, turned red once more. A
second piece of parchment shot out of it, propelled by the flames.“The champion for Beauxbatons,” said Dumbledore, “is Fleur Delacour!”
“It’s her, Ron!” Harry shouted as the girl who so resembled a veela got
gracefully to her feet, shook back her sheet of silvery blo .
Dear Sirius,
You told me to keep you posted on what’s happening at Hogwarts,
so here goes — 
I don’t know if you’ve heard, but the Triwizard
Tournament’s happening this year and on Saturday night I got
picked as a fourth champion. I don’t know who put my name in the
Goblet of Fire, because I didn’t. The other Hogwarts champion is
Cedric Diggory, from Hufflepuff.
He paused at this point, thinking. He had an urge to say something about
the large weight of anxiety that seemed to have settled inside his chest since
last night, but he couldn’t think how to translate this into words, so he simply
dipped his quill back into the ink bottle and wrote,
 
Hope you’re okay, and Buckbeak — 
“Finished,” he told Hermione, getting to his feet and brushing straw off his
robes. At this, Hedwig came fluttering down onto his shoulder and held out
her leg.
“I can’t use you,” Harry told her, looking around for the school owls. “I’ve
got to use one of these. . . .”
Hedwig gave a very loud hoot and took off so suddenly that her ta ance of the sign in the entrance hall had a marked effect upon
the inhabitants of the castle. During the following week, there seemed to be
only one topic of conversation, no matter where Harry went: the Triwizard
Tournament. Rumors were flying from student to student like highly
contagious germs: who was going to try for Hogwarts champion, what the
tournament would involve, how the students from Beauxbatons and
Durmstrang differed from themselves.
Harry noticed too that the castle seemed to be undergoing an extra-
thorough cleaning. Several grimy portraits had been scrubbed, much to the
displeasure of their subjects, who sat huddled in their frames muttering darkly
and wincing as they felt their raw pink faces. The suits of armor were
suddenly gleaming and moving without squeaking, and Argus Filch, thecaretaker, was behaving so ferociously to any students who forgot to wipe
their shoes that he terrified a pair of first-year girls into hysterics.
Other members of the staff seemed oddly tense too.
“Longbottom, or consideration. This”
— Dumbledore raised his voice slightly, for several people had made noises
of outrage at these words, and the Weasley twins were suddenly looking
furious — “is a measure we feel is necessary, given that the tournament tasks
will still be difficult and dangerous, whatever precautions we take, and it is
highly unlikely that students below sixth and seventh year will be able to cope
with them. I will personally be ensuring that no underage student hoodwinks
our impartial judge into making them Hogwarts champion.” His light blueeyes twinkled as they flickered over Fred’s and George’s mutinous faces. “I
therefore beg you not to waste your time submitting yourself if you are under
seventeen.
“The delegations from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang will be arriving in
October and remaining with us for the greater part of this year. I know that
you will all extend every courtesy to our foreign guests while they are with
us, and will give your whole-hearted support to the Hogwarts champion when
he or s  the campsite. A huddle of teenagers in pajamas
was arguing vociferously a little way along the path. When they saw Harry,
Ron, and Hermione, a girl with thick curly hair turned and said quickly, 
“Où
est Madame Maxime? Nous l’avons perdue —”
“Er — what?” said Ron.
“Oh . . .” The girl who had spoken turned her back on him, and as they
walked on they distinctly heard her say, “’Ogwarts.”
“Beauxbatons,” muttered Hermione.
“Sorry?” said Harry.
“They must go to Beauxbatons,” said Hermione. “You know . . .
Beauxbatons Academy of Magic . . . I read about it in 
An Appraisal of
Magical Education in Europe.
”
“Oh . . . yeah . . . right,” said Harry.
“Fred and George can’t have gone that far,” said Ron, pulling out his wand,
lighting it like Hermione’s, and squinting up the path. Harry dug in the
pockets of his jacket for his own wand — but it wasn’t there. The only thing
he could find was his Omnioculars.
“Ah, no, I don’t believe it . . . I’ve lost my wand!”
“You’re kidding!”
Ron and Hermione raised their wands high  ontenders in October, and the selection of the three champions
will take place at Halloween. An impartial judge will decide which students
are most worthy to compete for the Triwizard Cup, the glory of their school,
and a thousand Galleons personal prize money.”
“I’m going for it!” Fred Weasley hissed down the table, his face lit with
enthusiasm at the prospect of such glory and riches. He was not the only
person who seemed to be visualizing himself as the Hogwarts champion. At
every House table, Harry could see people either gazing raptly at
Dumbledore, or else whispering fervently to their neighbors. But then
Dumbledore spoke again, and the Hall quieted once more.
“Eager though I know all of you will be to bring the Triwizard Cup to
Hogwarts,” he said, “the Heads of the participating schools, along with the
Ministry of Magic, have agreed to impose an age restriction on contenders
this year. Only students who are of age — that is to say, seventeen years or
older — will be allowed to put forward their names f"

themselves:
I AM LORD VOLDEMORT
“You see?” he whispered. “It was a name I was already using at Hogwarts,
to my most intimate friends only, of course. You think I was going to use my
filthy Muggle father’s name forever? I, in whose veins runs the blood of
Salazar Slytherin himself, through my mother’s side? I, keep the name of a
foul, common Muggle, who abandoned me even before I was born, just
because he found out his wife was a witch? No, Harry — I fashioned myself a
new name, a name I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak,when I had become the greatest sorcerer in the world!”
Harry’s brain seemed to have jammed. He stared numbly at Riddle, at the
orphaned boy who had grown up to murder Harry’s own parents, and so many
others. . . . At last he forced himself to speak.
“You’re not,” he said, his quiet voice full of hatred.
“Not what?” snapped Riddle.
“Not the greatest sorcerer in the world,” said Harry, breathing fast. “Sorry
to disappoint you and all that, but the grea s?” said Harry.“Exactly . . . she disappeared in Albania, and that’s definitely where
Voldemort was rumored to be last . . . and she would have known the
Triwizard Tournament was coming up, wouldn’t she?”
“Yeah, but . . . it’s not very likely she’d have walked straight into
Voldemort, is it?” said Harry.
“Listen, I knew Bertha Jorkins,” said Sirius grimly. “She was at Hogwarts
when I was, a few years above your dad and me. And she was an idiot. Very
nosy, but no brains, none at all. It’s not a good combination, Harry. I’d say
she’d be very easy to lure into a trap.”
“So . . . so Voldemort could have found out about the tournament?” said
Harry. “Is that what you mean? You think Karkaroff might be here on his
orders?”
“I don’t know,” said Sirius slowly, “I just don’t know . . . Karkaroff doesn’t
strike me as the type who’d go back to Voldemort unless he knew Voldemort
was powerful enough to protect him. But whoever put your name in that
goblet did it for a reason, and I can’t help thinking the tournament would  said. Was it — was she making a
real prediction?”
Dumbledore looked mildly impressed.
“Do you know, Harry, I think she might have been,” he said thoughtfully.
“Who’d have thought it? That brings her total of real predictions up to two. I
should offer her a pay raise. . . .”
“But —” Harry looked at him, aghast. How could Dumbledore take this so
calmly?
“But — I stopped Sirius and Professor Lupin from killing Pettigrew! That
makes it my fault if Voldemort comes back!”
“It does not,” said Dumbledore quietly. “Hasn’t your experience with the
Time-Turner taught you anything, Harry? The consequences of our actions
are always so complicated, so diverse, that predicting the future is a verydifficult business indeed. . . . Professor Trelawney, bless her, is living proof of
that. . . . You did a very noble thing, in saving Pettigrew’s life.”
“But if he helps Voldemort back to power — !”
“Pettigrew owes his life to you. You have sent Voldemort a deputy who is
in your debt. When one wizard saves another wizard’s life, it 
come a time when Lord Voldemort will seem to fear for the life of his snake.”
“For Nagini?” Snape looked astonished.
“Precisely. If there comes a time when Lord Voldemort stops sending that
snake forth to do his bidding, but keeps it safe beside him under magicalprotection, then, I think, it will be safe to tell Harry.”
“Tell him what?”
Dumbledore took a deep breath and closed his eyes.
“Tell him that on the night Lord Voldemort tried to kill him, when Lily cast
her own life between them as a shield, the Killing Curse rebounded upon
Lord Voldemort, and a fragment of Voldemort’s soul was blasted apart from
the whole, and latched itself onto the only living soul left in that collapsing
building. Part of Lord Voldemort lives inside Harry, and it is that which gives
him the power of speech with snakes, and a connection with Lord
Voldemort’s mind that he has never understood. And while that fragment of
soul, unmissed by Voldemort, remains attached to and protected by Harry,
Lord Voldemort cannot die.”
Harry seeme 
their charges’ youthful beginnings.”
He raised his glass as though toasting Voldemort, whose face remained
expressionless. Nevertheless, Harry felt the atmosphere in the room change
subtly: Dumbledore’s refusal to use Voldemort’s chosen name was a refusal to
allow Voldemort to dictate the terms of the meeting, and Harry could tell that
Voldemort took it as such.
“I am surprised you have remained here so long,” said Voldemort after a
short pause. “I always wondered why a wizard such as yourself never wished
to leave school.”
“Well,” said Dumbledore, still smiling, “to a wizard such as myself, there
can be nothing more important than passing on ancient skills, helping hone
young minds. If I remember correctly, you once saw the attraction of teaching
too.”
“I see it still,” said Voldemort. “I merely wondered why you — who are so
often asked for advice by the Ministry, and who have twice, I think, been
offered the post of Minister —”
“Three times at the last count, actually,” said Dumbledore. “But the
Ministry n mbledore. “I had advised Armando against the
appointment — I did not give the reasons I have given you, for Professor
Dippet was very fond of Voldemort and convinced of his honesty. But I did
not want Lord Voldemort back at this school, and especially not in a position
of power.”
“Which job did he want, sir? What subject did he want to teach?”Somehow, Harry knew the answer even before Dumbledore gave it.
“Defense Against the Dark Arts. It was being taught at the time by an old
professor by the name of Galatea Merrythought, who had been at Hogwarts
for nearly fifty years.
“So Voldemort went off to Borgin and Burkes, and all the staff who had
admired him said what a waste it was, a brilliant young wizard like that,
working in a shop. However, Voldemort was no mere assistant. Polite and
handsome and clever, he was soon given particular jobs of the type that only
exist in a place like Borgin and Burkes, which specializes, as you know,
Harry, in objects with unusual and powerful properties. Voldemort was sent to
p ly, an idle sort of dream . . . he’d never really, 
seriously
considered entering. . . .
But someone else had considered it . . . someone else had wanted him in
the tournament, and had made sure he was entered. Why? To give him a treat?
He didn’t think so, somehow. . . .
To see him make a fool of himself? Well, they were likely to get their
wish. . . .
But to get him 
killed
?
Was Moody just being his usual paranoid self? Couldn’t someone have put
Harry’s name in the goblet as a trick, a practical joke? Did anyone really want
him dead?Harry was able to answer that at once. Yes, someone wanted him dead,
someone had wanted him dead ever since he had been a year old . . . Lord
Voldemort. But how could Voldemort have ensured that Harry’s name got into
the Goblet of Fire? Voldemort was supposed to be far away, in some distant
country, in hiding, alone . . . feeble and powerless. . . .
Yet in that dream he had had, just before he had awoken with his scar
hurting, Voldemort had not been alone . . . he had been talki place yourself, Severus. To give Voldemort
what appears to be valuable information while withholding the essentials is a
job I would entrust to nobody but you.”
“Yet you confide much more in a boy who is incapable of Occlumency,
whose magic is mediocre, and who has a direct connection into the Dark
Lord’s mind!”
“Voldemort fears that connection,” said Dumbledore. “Not so long ago he
had one small taste of what truly sharing Harry’s mind means to him. It was
pain such as he has never experienced. He will not try to possess Harry again,
I am sure of it. Not in that way.”
“I don’t understand.”“Lord Voldemort’s soul, maimed as it is, cannot bear close contact with a
soul like Harry’s. Like a tongue on frozen steel, like flesh in flame —”
“Souls? We were talking of minds!”
“In the case of Harry and Lord Voldemort, to speak of one is to speak of the
other.”
Dumbledore glanced around to make sure that they were alone. They were
close by the Forbidden Forest now, but there was no sign of anyone near
them.
“After you "

You mean that you did magic without meaning to; you reacted instinctively.”
“No,” said Harry. “The bike was falling, I couldn’t have told you where
Voldemort was, but my wand spun in my hand and found him and shot a spell
at him, and it wasn’t even a spell I recognized. I’ve never made gold flames
appear before.”
“Often,” said Mr. Weasley, “when you’re in a pressured situation you can
produce magic you never dreamed of. Small children often find, before
they’re trained —”
“It wasn’t like that,” said Harry through gritted teeth. His scar was burning:
He felt angry and frustrated; he hated the idea that they were all imagining
him to have power to match Voldemort’s.
No one said anything. He knew that they did not believe him. Now that he
came to think of it, he had never heard of a wand performing magic on its
own before.His scar seared with pain; it was all he could do not to moan aloud.
Muttering about fresh air, he set down his glass and left the room.
As he crossed  lt a creeping chill behind him that could mean only
one thing. There was more than one.
“DUDLEY, KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT! WHATEVER YOU DO,
KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT! Wand!” Harry muttered frantically, his hands
flying over the ground like spiders. “Where’s — wand — come on —
Lumos!
”
He said the spell automatically, desperate for light to help him in his search
— and to his disbelieving relief, light flared inches from his right hand — the
wand-tip had ignited. Harry snatched it up, scrambled to his feet, and turned
around.
His stomach turned over.
A towering, hooded figure was gliding smoothly toward him, hovering over
the ground, no feet or face visible beneath its robes, sucking on the night as it
came.Stumbling backward, Harry raised his wand.
“Expecto Patronum!”
A silvery wisp of vapor shot from the tip of the wand and the dementor
slowed, but the spell hadn’t worked properly; tripping over his feet, Harry
retreated farther as the dementor bore down upon him, panic fogging his brain
—

“What about dementors?” called another Death Eater. “Let ’em have free

“The Dark Lord wants Potter dead by no hand but his —”
“— an’ dementors won’t kill him! The Dark Lord wants Potter’s life, not
his soul. He’ll be easier to kill if he’s been Kissed first!”
There were noises of agreement. Dread filled Harry: To repel dementors
they would have to produce Patronuses, which would give them away
immediately.
“We’re going to have to try to Disapparate, Harry!” Hermione whispered.
Even as she said it, he felt the unnatural cold begin to steal over the street.
Light was sucked from the environment right up to the stars, which vanished.
In the pitch-blackness, he felt Hermione take hold of his arm and together,
they turned on the spot.
The air through which they needed to move seemed to have become solid:They could not Disapparate; the Death Eaters had cast their cha Dark Arts. Here, for the first time, Harry
felt sure he had passed. He had no problem with any of the written questions
and took particular pleasure, during the practical examination, in performing
all the counterjinxes and defensive spells right in front of Umbridge, who was
watching coolly from near the doors into the entrance hall.
“Oh bravo!” cried Professor Tofty, who was examining Harry again, whenHarry demonstrated a perfect boggart banishing spell. “Very good indeed!
Well, I think that’s all, Potter . . . unless . . .”
He leaned forward a little.
“I heard, from my dear friend Tiberius Ogden, that you can produce a
Patronus? For a bonus point . . . ?”
Harry raised his wand, looked directly at Umbridge, and imagined her
being sacked.
“Expecto Patronum!”
The silver stag erupted from the end of his wand and cantered the length of
the hall. All of the examiners looked around to watch its progress and when it
dissolved into silver mist, Professor Tofty clapped his veined and knotted
hands enthusiastically.
 ed, 
“Stupefy!”
The great blond Death Eater was hit in the face by a jet of red light: He
slumped sideways, unconscious. His companion, unable to see who had cast
the spell, fired another at Ron: Shining black ropes flew from his wand-tip
and bound Ron head to foot — the waitress screamed and ran for the door —
Harry sent another Stunning Spell at the Death Eater with the twisted face
who had tied up Ron, but the spell missed, rebounded on the window, and hit
the waitress, who collapsed in front of the door.“Expulso!”
 bellowed the Death Eater, and the table behind which Harry
was standing blew up: The force of the explosion slammed him into the wall
and he felt his wand leave his hand as the Cloak slipped off him.
“Petrificus Totalus!”
 screamed Hermione from out of sight, and the Death
Eater fell forward like a statue to land with a crunching thud on the mess of
broken china, table, and coffee. Hermione crawled out from underneath the
bench, shaking bits of glass ashtray out of her hair and trembling all ov isper,
“bit of a danger to himself, bless him. . . . Doesn’t know who he is, you see,wanders off and can’t remember how to get back. . . . It

“Er,” said Ron, gesturing uselessly at the floor above, “actually, we were
just — er —”
But the Healer was smiling expectantly at them, and Ron’s feeble mutter of
“going to have a cup of tea” trailed away into nothingness. They looked at
one another rather hopelessly and then followed Lockhart and his Healer
along the corridor.
“Let’s not stay long,” Ron said quietly.
The Healer pointed her wand at the door of the Janus Thickey ward and
muttered 
“Alohomora.” 
The door swung open and she led the way inside,
keeping a firm grasp on Gilderoy’s arm until she had settled him into an
armchair beside his bed.
“This is our long-term resident ward,” she informed Harry, Ron, Hermione,
and Ginny in a low voice. “For permanent spell damage, you know. Of
course, with intensive remedial potions and charms and a bit of luck, we can

twisted with glee.
“Tarantallegra!” 
he shouted, his wand pointing at Neville, whose legs
went immediately into a kind of frenzied tap dance, unbalancing him and
causing him to fall to the floor again. “Now, Potter —”
He made the same slashing movement with his wand that he had used on
Hermione just as Harry yelled, 
“Protego!”
Harry felt something streak across his face like a blunt knife but the forceof it knocked him sideways, and he fell over Neville’s jerking legs, but the
Shield Charm had stopped the worst of the spell.
Dolohov raised his wand again. 
“Accio Proph —”
Sirius hurtled out of nowhere, rammed Dolohov with his shoulder, and sent
him flying out of the way. The prophecy had again flown to the tips of
Harry’s fingers but he had managed to cling to it. Now Sirius and Dolohov
were dueling, their wands flashing like swords, sparks flying from their wand
tips —
Dolohov drew back his wand to make the same slashing movement he had
used on Harry and Hermione. Springing up, Harr amusing was
Hermione, who maintained a rigidly disapproving expression throughout and
refused to talk at all if Harry had used the 
Muffliato
 spell on anyone in the
vicinity.
Sitting up in bed, Harry turned the book sideways so as to examine more
closely the scribbled instructions for a spell that seemed to have caused the
Prince some trouble. There were many crossings-out and alterations, but
finally, crammed into a corner of the page, the scribble:
Levicorpus (nvbl)
While the wind and sleet pounded relentlessly on the windows, and Neville
snored loudly, Harry stared at the letters in brackets. 
Nvbl . . . 
that had to
mean “nonverbal.” Harry rather doubted he would be able to bring off this
particular spell; he was still having difficulty with nonverbal spells,
something Snape had been quick to comment on in every D.A.D.A. class. On
the other hand, the Prince had proved a much more effective teacher than
Snape so far.
Pointing his wand at nothing in particular, he gave it an upward flick and

spotted the hanging cat. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood alone, in the middle
of the corridor, as silence fell among the mass of students pressing forward to
see the grisly sight.
Then someone shouted through the quiet.
“Enemies of the Heir, beware! You’ll be next, Mudbloods!”
It was Draco Malfoy. He had pushed to the front of the crowd, his cold eyes
alive, his usually bloodless face flushed, as he grinned at the sight of the
hanging, immobile cat.W

hat’s going on here? What’s going on?”
Attracted no doubt by Malfoy’s shout, Argus Filch came
shouldering his way through the crowd. Then he saw Mrs. Norris and fell
back, clutching his face in horror.
“My cat! My cat! What’s happened to Mrs. Norris?” he shrieked.
And his popping eyes fell on Harry.
“You!”
 he screeched. “
You!
 You’ve murdered my cat! You’ve killed her!
I’ll kill you! I’ll —”
“Argus!”
Dumbledore had arrived on the scene, followed by a number of other
teachers. In seconds, he had swept past Harry, Ron, ssaging his head.
“What 
was
 that?”
“It was either a very big cat or quite a small tiger,” said Harry.
“Where’s Hermione?”
“Probably getting her owl —”
They made their way back up the crowded street to the Magical Menagerie.
As they reached it, Hermione came out, but she wasn’t carrying an owl. Her
arms were clamped tightly around the enormous ginger cat.
“You 
bought
 that monster?” said Ron, his mouth hanging open.
“He’s 
gorgeous,
 isn’t he?” said Hermione, glowing.
That was a matter of opinion, thought Harry. The cat’s ginger fur was thick
and fluffy, but it was definitely a bit bowlegged and its face looked grumpy
and oddly squashed, as though it had run headlong into a brick wall. Now that
Scabbers was out of sight, however, the cat was purring contentedly in
Hermione’s arms.
“Hermione, that thing nearly scalped me!” said Ron.
“He didn’t mean to, did you, Crookshanks?” said Hermione.
“And what about Scabbers?” said Ron, pointing at the lump in his chest
pocket. “He needs rest and relaxation! How’s he g  the house. He got into his car and
backed out of number four’s drive.
It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something
peculiar — a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn’t realize what
he had seen — then he jerked his head around to look again. There was a
tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn’t a map in
sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the
light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley
drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It
was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive — no, 
looking
 at the sign;
cats couldn’t read maps 
or
 signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and
put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing
except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.
But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something
else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic  drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on
the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a
statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didn’t
so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two
owls swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved
at all.
A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so
suddenly and silently you’d have thought he’d just popped out of the ground.
The cat’s tail twitched and its eyes narrowed.Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was tall, thin,
and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both
long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak
that swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were
light, bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was very
long and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. This man’s
name was A lbus Dumbledore.
Albus Dumbledore didn’t seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street
where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He was busy
rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But he did seem to realize he
was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still
staring at him from the other end of the street. For some reason, the sight of
the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and muttered, “I should have
known.”
He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It seemed to be a
silver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it.
The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. He clicked it again — the
next lamp flickered into darkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer,
until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the
distance, which were the eyes of the cat watching him. If anyone looked out
of their window now, even beady-eyed Mrs. Dursley, they wouldn’t be able to
see anyt rs of his name rearranged
themselves:
I AM LORD VOLDEMORT
“You see?” he whispered. “It was a name I was already using at Hogwarts,
to my most intimate friends only, of course. You think I was going to use my
filthy Muggle father’s name forever? I, in whose veins runs the blood of
Salazar Slytherin himself, through my mother’s side? I, keep the name of a
foul, common Muggle, who abandoned me even before I was born, just
because he found out his wife was a witch? No, Harry — I fashioned myself a
new name, a name I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak,when I had become the greatest sorcerer in the world!”
Harry’s brain seemed to have jammed. He stared numbly at Riddle, at the
orphaned boy who had grown up to murder Harry’s own parents, and so many
others. . . . At last he forced himself to speak.
“You’re not,” he said, his quiet voice full of hatred.
“Not what?” snapped Riddle.
“Not the greatest sorcerer in the world,” said Harry, breathing fast. “Sorry
to disappoint you and all that, but the grea hing that was happening down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped
the Put-Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number
four, where he sat down on the wall next to the cat. He didn’t look at it, but
after a moment he spoke to it.
“Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.”
He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was smiling at a
rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the
shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was wearing a
cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She looked
distinctly ruffled.
“How did you know it was me?” she asked.“My dear Professor, I’ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly.”
“You’d be stiff if you’d been sitting on a brick wall all day,” said Professor
McGonagall.
“All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have passed a
dozen feasts and parties on my way here.”
Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily.
“Oh yes, everyone’s celebrating, all right,” she said impati reen onion, a large spotted toadstool, and
a considerable amount of what looked like cat litter into Ron’s hands, finally
pulling out a rather grubby scroll of parchment that she handed to Harry.
“. . . I’ve been told to give you this.”
It was a small roll of parchment, which Harry recognized at once as another
invitation to a lesson with Dumbledore.
“Tonight,” he told Ron and Hermione, once he had unrolled it.
“Nice commentary last match!” said Ron to Luna as she took back the
green onion, the toadstool, and the cat litter. Luna smiled vaguely.
“You’re making fun of me, aren’t you?” she said. “Everyone says I was
dreadful.”“No, I’m serious!” said Ron earnestly. “I can’t remember enjoying
commentary more! What is this, by the way?” he added, holding the onionlike
object up to eye level.
“Oh, it’s a Gurdyroot,” she said, stuffing the cat litter and the toadstool
back into her bag. “You can keep it if you like, I’ve got a few of them.
They’re really excellent for warding off Gulping Plimpies.”
And she walked aw"

Hermione had already jumped. She landed on Harry’s other side.
“We must be miles under the school,” she said.
“Lucky this plant thing’s here, really,” said Ron.
“Lucky!”
 shrieked Hermione. “Look at you both!”
She leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. She had to struggle
because the moment she had landed, the plant had started to twist snakelike
tendrils around her ankles. As for Harry and Ron, their legs had already been
bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing.
Hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on
her. Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off
them, but the more they strained against it, the tighter and faster the plant
wound around them.
“Stop moving!” Hermione ordered them. “I know what this is — it’s
Devil’s Snare!”
“Oh, I’m so glad we know what it’s called, that’s a great help,” snarled
Ron, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck.
“Shut up, I’m oke. Nearly everyone laughed, and Dumbledore chuckled appreciatively.
“I am 
not
 joking, Mr. Weasley,” he said, “though now that you mention it, I
did hear an excellent one over the summer about a troll, a hag, and a
leprechaun who all go into a bar . . .”
Professor McGonagall cleared her throat loudly.
“Er — but maybe this is not the time . . . no . . .” said Dumbledore, “where
was I? Ah yes, the Triwizard Tournament . . . well, some of you will not know
what this tournament involves, so I hope those who 
do
 know will forgive me
for giving a short explanation, and allow their attention to wander freely.
“The Triwizard Tournament was first established some seven hundred years
ago as a friendly competition between the three largest European schools of
wizardry: Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, and Durmstrang. A champion was selected
to represent each school, and the three champions competed in three magical
tasks. The schools took it in turns to host the tournament once every five
years, and it was generally agreed to d him.
“I’ve got to go and look for people who can’t use their voices above the
ground. . . .” he said slowly. “Er . . . who could that be?”
“Slow, aren’t you?”
He had never seen Moaning Myrtle so cheerful, apart from the day when a
dose of Polyjuice Potion had given Hermione the hairy face and tail of a cat.
Harry stared around the bathroom, thinking . . . if the voices could only be
heard underwater, then it made sense for them to belong to underwater
creatures. He ran this theory past Myrtle, who smirked at him.
“Well, that’s what Diggory thought,” she said. “He lay there talking to
himself for ages about it. Ages and ages . . . nearly all the bubbles had
gone. . . .”“Underwater . . .” Harry said slowly. “Myrtle . . . what lives in the lake,
apart from the giant squid?”
“Oh all sorts,” she said. “I sometimes go down there . . . sometimes don’t
have any choice, if someone flushes my toilet when I’m not expecting it. . . .”
Trying not to think about Moaning Myrtle zooming down a pipe to the lake
with the con s?” said Harry.“Exactly . . . she disappeared in Albania, and that’s definitely where
Voldemort was rumored to be last . . . and she would have known the
Triwizard Tournament was coming up, wouldn’t she?”
“Yeah, but . . . it’s not very likely she’d have walked straight into
Voldemort, is it?” said Harry.
“Listen, I knew Bertha Jorkins,” said Sirius grimly. “She was at Hogwarts
when I was, a few years above your dad and me. And she was an idiot. Very
nosy, but no brains, none at all. It’s not a good combination, Harry. I’d say
she’d be very easy to lure into a trap.”
“So . . . so Voldemort could have found out about the tournament?” said
Harry. “Is that what you mean? You think Karkaroff might be here on his
orders?”
“I don’t know,” said Sirius slowly, “I just don’t know . . . Karkaroff doesn’t
strike me as the type who’d go back to Voldemort unless he knew Voldemort
was powerful enough to protect him. But whoever put your name in that
goblet did it for a reason, and I can’t help thinking the tournament would  ght . . . yeah, nervous, I suppose,” said Harry. His
insides squirmed uncomfortably as he spoke.“Champions have died in the past, haven’t they?” said Rita Skeeter briskly.
“Have you thought about that at all?”
“Well . . . they say it’s going to be a lot safer this year,” said Harry.
The quill whizzed across the parchment between them, back and forward as
though it were skating.
“Of course, you’ve looked death in the face before, haven’t you?” said Rita
Skeeter, watching him closely. “How would you say that’s affected you?”
“Er,” said Harry, yet again.
“Do you think that the trauma in your past might have made you keen to
prove yourself? To live up to your name? Do you think that perhaps you were
tempted to enter the Triwizard Tournament because —”
“I didn’t enter,”
 said Harry, starting to feel irritated.
“Can you remember your parents at all?” said Rita Skeeter, talking over
him.
“No,” said Harry.
“How do you think they’d feel if they knew you were competing in the
Triwizard Tournament? Proud? Worried? Angry oken or —”
“That’s not funny,” said Hermione quietly. “That’s not funny at all.” She
looked extremely anxious. “Harry, I’ve been thinking — 
you know what
we’ve got to do, don’t you? Straight away, the moment we get back to the
castle?”
“Yeah, give Ron a good kick up the —”
“
Write to Sirius.
 You’ve got to tell him what’s happened. He asked you to
keep him posted on everything that’s going on at Hogwarts. . . . It’s almost as
if he expected something like this to happen. I brought some parchment and a
quill out with me —”
“Come off it,” said Harry, looking around to check that they couldn’t be
overheard, but the grounds were quite deserted. “He came back to the country
just because my scar twinged. He’ll probably come bursting right into the
castle if I tell him someone’s entered me in the Triwizard Tournament —”
“He’d want you to tell him,”
 said Hermione sternly. “He’s going to find out
anyway —”
“How?”
“Harry, this isn’t going to be kept quiet,” said Hermione, very seriously.
“This tournament’s famous, an stared at the thing. It was pulsating slightly, giving it the rather
sinister look of some diseased internal organ.
“It’s really, really rare,” said Neville, beaming. “I don’t know if there’s one
in the greenhouse at Hogwarts, even. I can’t wait to show it to Professor
Sprout. My great-uncle Algie got it for me in Assyria. I’m going to see if I
can breed from it.”
Harry knew that Neville’s favorite subject was Herbology, but for the life
of him he could not see what he would want with this stunted little plant.
“Does it — er — do anything?” he asked.
“Loads of stuff!” said Neville proudly. “It’s got an amazing defensive
mechanism — hold Trevor for me . . .”He dumped the toad into Harry’s lap and took a quill from his schoolbag.
Luna Lovegood’s popping eyes appeared over the top of her upside-down
magazine again, watching what Neville was doing. Neville held the 
Mimbulus
mimbletonia
 up to his eyes, his tongue between his teeth, chose his spot, and
gave the plant a sharp prod with the tip of his quill.
Liquid  be a most excellent way of establishing
ties between young witches and wizards of different nationalities — until, that
is, the death toll mounted so high that the tournament was discontinued.”
“Death toll?”
 Hermione whispered, looking alarmed. But her anxiety didnot seem to be shared by the majority of students in the Hall; many of them
were whispering excitedly to one another, and Harry himself was far more
interested in hearing about the tournament than in worrying about deaths that
had happened hundreds of years ago.
“There have been several attempts over the centuries to reinstate the
tournament,” Dumbledore continued, “none of which has been very
successful. However, our own Departments of International Magical
Cooperation and Magical Games and Sports have decided the time is ripe for
another attempt. We have worked hard over the summer to ensure that this
time, no champion will find himself or herself in mortal danger.

“Hagrid, he killed . . .”
“Killed?” said Hagrid loudly, staring down at Harry. “Snape killed?
What’re yeh on abou’, Harry?”
“Dumbledore,” said Harry. “Snape killed . . . Dumbledore.”
Hagrid simply looked at him, the little of his face that could be seen
completely blank, uncomprehending.
“Dumbledore wha’, Harry?”
“He’s dead. Snape killed him. . . .”
“Don’ say that,” said Hagrid roughly. “Snape kill Dumbledore — don’ be
stupid, Harry. Wha’s made yeh say tha’?”
“I saw it happen.”
“Yeh couldn’ have.”
“I saw it, Hagrid.”
Hagrid shook his head; his expression was disbelieving but sympathetic,
and Harry knew that Hagrid thought he had sustained a blow to the head, that
he was confused, perhaps by the aftereffects of a jinx. . . .
“What musta happened was, Dumbledore musta told Snape ter go with
them Death Eaters,” Hagrid said confidently. “I suppose he’s gotta keep his
cover. Look, let’s get yeh back up ter the school. Come on, Harry. . . .”
Harry did not attempt   the corridor. Snape had returned
with Winky at his heels. Professor McGonagall was right behind them.
“Crouch!” Snape said, stopping dead in the doorway. “Barty Crouch!”
“Good heavens,” said Professor McGonagall, stopping dead and staring
down at the man on the floor.
Filthy, disheveled, Winky peered around Snape’s legs. Her mouth opened
wide and she let out a piercing shriek.
“Master Barty, Master Barty, what is you doing here?”She flung herself forward onto the young man’s chest.
“You is killed him! You is killed him! You is killed Master’s son!”
“He is simply Stunned, Winky,” said Dumbledore. “Step aside, please.
Severus, you have the potion?”
Snape handed Dumbledore a small glass bottle of completely clear liquid:
the Veritaserum with which he had threatened Harry in class. Dumbledore got
up, bent over the man on the floor, and pulled him into a sitting position
against the wall beneath the Foe-Glass, in which the reflections of
Dumbledore, Snape, and McGonagall were still glaring down upon them all.
Win uld not hurt
Potter; my master needed him. Potter ran to get Dumbledore. I Stunned Krum.
I killed my father.”
“Noooo!”
 wailed Winky. “Master Barty, Master Barty, what is you
saying?”
“You killed your father,” Dumbledore said, in the same soft voice. “Whatdid you do with the body?”
“Carried it into the forest. Covered it with the Invisibility Cloak. I had the
map with me. I watched Potter run into the castle. He met Snape. Dumbledore
joined them. I watched Potter bringing Dumbledore out of the castle. I walked
back out of the forest, doubled around behind them, went to meet them. I told
Dumbledore Snape had told me where to come.
“Dumbledore told me to go and look for my father. I went back to my
father’s body. Watched the map. When everyone was gone, I Transfigured my
father’s body. He became a bone . . . I buried it, while wearing the Invisibility
Cloak, in the freshly dug earth in front of Hagrid’s cabin.”
There was complete silence now, except for Winky’s continued sobs. Then
Dumbledore said, “And tonight r pardon, Harry. I
have known, for some time now, that you are the better man.”
“What are you talking about?” asked Harry, startled by Dumbledore’s tone,
by the sudden tears in his eyes.
“The Hallows, the Hallows,” murmured Dumbledore. “A desperate man’s
dream!”
“But they’re real!”
“Real, and dangerous, and a lure for fools,” said Dumbledore. “And I was
such a fool. But you know, don’t you? I have no secrets from you anymore.
You know.”
“What do I know?”
Dumbledore turned his whole body to face Harry, and tears still sparkled in
the brilliantly blue eyes.
“Master of death, Harry, master of Death! Was I better, ultimately, than
Voldemort?”
“Of course you were,” said Harry. “Of course — how can you ask that?
You never killed if you could avoid it!”
“True, true,” said Dumbledore, and he was like a child seeking reassurance.
“Yet I too sought a way to conquer death, Harry.”
“Not the way he did,” said Harry. After all his anger at Dumbledore, how
odd it was to sit here, beneath the high, vaulted ceiling, and defen  was Dumbledore’s spy
from the moment you threatened her, and he’s been working against you ever
since! Dumbledore was already dying when Snape finished him!”
“It matters not!” shrieked Voldemort, who had followed every word with
rapt attention, but now let out a cackle of mad laughter. “It matters not
whether Snape was mine or Dumbledore’s, or what petty obstacles they tried
to put in my path! I crushed them as I crushed your mother, Snape’s supposed
great 
love
! Oh, but it all makes sense, Potter, and in ways that you do not
understand!
“Dumbledore was trying to keep the Elder Wand from me! He intended that
Snape should be the true master of the wand! But I got there ahead of you,
little boy — I reached the wand before you could get your hands on it, I
understood the truth before you caught up. I killed Severus Snape three hours
ago, and the Elder Wand, the Deathstick, the Wand of Destiny is truly mine!
Dumbledore’s last plan went wrong, Harry Potter!”
“Yeah, it did,” said Harry. “You’re right. But before  tasted something
very bitter.
“Now, about tonight,” Dumbledore went on, “I am a little puzzled about
how it happened. . . . You knew that I had left the school? But of course,” he
answered his own question, “Rosmerta saw me leaving, she tipped you off
using your ingenious coins, I’m sure.”
“That’s right,” said Malfoy. “But she said you were just going for a drink,
you’d be back. . . .”
“Well, I certainly did have a drink . . . and I came back . . . after a fashion,”
mumbled Dumbledore. “So you decided to spring a trap for me?”
“We decided to put the Dark Mark over the tower and get you to hurry up
here, to see who’d been killed,” said Malfoy. “And it worked!”
“Well . . . yes and no . . .” said Dumbledore. “But am I to take it, then, that
nobody has been murdered?”
“Someone’s dead,” said Malfoy, and his voice seemed to go up an octave as
he said it. “One of your people . . . I don’t know who, it was dark. . . . I
stepped over the body. . . . I was supposed to be waiting up here when you got
back, only your Pho s were directed only at Voldemort, who
had tampered so ill-advisedly with the deepest laws of magic. Only toward
him was that wand abnormally powerful. Otherwise it was a wand like any
other . . . though a good one, I am sure,” Dumbledore finished kindly.Harry sat in thought for a long time, or perhaps seconds. It was very hard to
be sure of things like time, here.
“He killed me with your wand.”
“He 
failed 
to kill you with my wand,” Dumbledore corrected Harry. “I
think we can agree that you are not dead — though, of course,” he added, as if
fearing he had been discourteous, “I do not minimize your sufferings, which I
am sure were severe.”
“I feel great at the moment, though,” said Harry, looking down at his clean,
unblemished hands. “Where are we, exactly?”
“Well, I was going to ask you that,” said Dumbledore, looking around.
“Where would you say that we are?”
Until Dumbledore had asked, Harry had not known. Now, however, he
found that he had an answer ready to give.
“It looks,” he said slowly, “like King’s e. He knew what the dementor must have done. It had administered its
fatal Kiss to Barty Crouch. It had sucked his soul out through his mouth. He
was worse than dead.
“By all accounts, he is no loss!” blustered Fudge. “It seems he has been
responsible for several deaths!”
“But he cannot now give testimony, Cornelius,” said Dumbledore. He was
staring hard at Fudge, as though seeing him plainly for the first time. “He
cannot give evidence about why he killed those people.”
“Why he killed them? Well, that’s no mystery, is it?” blustered Fudge. “He
was a raving lunatic! From what Minerva and Severus have told me, he seems
to have thought he was doing it all on You-Know-Who’s instructions!”
“Lord Voldemort 
was
 giving him instructions, Cornelius,” Dumbledore
said. “Those people’s deaths were mere by-products of a plan to restore
Voldemort to full strength again. The plan succeeded. Voldemort has been
restored to his body.”Fudge looked as though someone had just swung a heavy weight into his
face. Dazed and blinki"

Dumbledore stopped pacing and looked at Harry.
“My apologies,” he said quietly. He sat back down at his desk.
“D’you — d’you know why my scar’s hurting me?”
Dumbledore looked very intently at Harry for a moment, and then said, “I
have a theory, no more than that. . . . It is my belief that your scar hurts both
when Lord Voldemort is near you, and when he is feeling a particularly strong
surge of hatred.”
“But . . . why?”
“Because you and he are connected by the curse that failed,” said
Dumbledore. “That is no ordinary scar.”
“So you think . . . that dream . . . did it really happen?”
“It is possible,” said Dumbledore. “I would say — probable. Harry — did
you see Voldemort?”
“No,” said Harry. “Just the back of his chair. But — there wouldn’t have
been anything to see, would there? I mean, he hasn’t got a body, has he?
But . . . but then how could he have held the wand?” Harry said slowly.
“How indeed?” muttered Dumbledore. “How indeed . . .”
Neither Dumbledore nor Harry spoke for a while. Dumbledor nsively.
“Boggarts like dark, enclosed spaces,” said Professor Lupin. “Wardrobes,
the gap beneath beds, the cupboards under sinks — I once met one that had
lodged itself in a grandfather clock. 
This
 one moved in yesterday afternoon,
and I asked the headmaster if the staff would leave it to give my third years
some practice.
“So, the first question we must ask ourselves is, what 
is
 a boggart?”
Hermione put up her hand.
“It’s a shape-shifter,” she said. “It can take the shape of whatever it thinks
will frighten us most.”
“Couldn’t have put it better myself,” said Professor Lupin, and Hermioneglowed. “So the boggart sitting in the darkness within has not yet assumed a
form. He does not yet know what will frighten the person on the other side of
the door. Nobody knows what a boggart looks like when he is alone, but when
I let him out, he will immediately become whatever each of us most fears.
“This means,” said Professor Lupin, choosing to ignore Neville’s small
sputter of terror, “that we have a huge advanta ge over the boggart before we
begin. Have you spotted it, Harry?”
Trying to answer a question with Hermione next to him, bobbing up and
down on the balls of her feet with her hand in the air, was very off-putting,
but Harry had a go.
“Er — because there are so many of us, it won’t know what shape it should
be?”
“Precisely,” said Professor Lupin, and Hermione put her hand down,
looking a little disappointed. “It’s always best to have company when you’re
dealing with a boggart. He becomes confused. Which should he become, a
headless corpse or a flesh-eating slug? I once saw a boggart make that very
mistake — tried to frighten two people at once and turned himself into half a
slug. Not remotely frightening.
“The charm that repels a boggart is simple, yet it requires force of mind.

Harry looked nothing like the rest of the family. Uncle Vernon was large
and neckless, with an enormous black mustache; Aunt Petunia was horse-
faced and bony; Dudley was blond, pink, and porky. Harry, on the other hand,
was small and skinny, with brilliant green eyes and jet-black hair that was
always untidy. He wore round glasses, and on his forehead was a thin,
lightning-shaped scar.
It was this scar that made Harry so particularly unusual, even for a wizard.
This scar was the only hint of Harry’s very mysterious past, of the reason he
had been left on the Dursleys’ doorstep eleven years before.
At the age of one year old, Harry had somehow survived a curse from the
greatest Dark sorcerer of all time, Lord Voldemort, whose name most witches
and wizards still feared to speak. Harry’s parents had died in Voldemort’sattack, but Harry had escaped with his lightning scar, and somehow —
nobody understood why — Voldemort’s powers had been destroyed the
instant he had failed to kill Harry.
So Harry h s destination at last. . . . The
black door swung open for him as usual, and here he was in the circular room
with its many doors. . . .
Straight across the stone floor and through the second door . . . patches of
dancing light on the walls and floor and that odd mechanical clicking, but no
time to explore, he must hurry. . . .
He jogged the last few feet to the third door, which swung open just like the
others. . . .
Once again he was in the cathedral-sized room full of shelves and glass
spheres. . . . His heart was beating very fast now. . . . He was going to get
there this time. . . . When he reached number ninety-seven he turned left and
hurried along the aisle between two rows. . . .But there was a shape on the floor at the very end, a black shape moving
upon the floor like a wounded animal. . . . Harry’s stomach contracted with
fear . . . with excitement. . . .
A voice issued from his own mouth, a high, cold voice empty of any human
kindness, “Take it for me. . . . Lift it down, now. . . . I cannot touc  rising up to the ceiling. Harry raised his wand, but as he did so, his
scar seared more painfully, more powerfully than it had done in years.
“He’s coming! 
Hermione, he’s coming!
”As he yelled the snake fell, hissing wildly. Everything was chaos: It
smashed shelves from the wall, and splintered china flew everywhere as
Harry jumped over the bed and seized the dark shape he knew to be Hermione
—
She shrieked with pain as he pulled her back across the bed: The snake
reared again, but Harry knew that worse than the snake was coming, was
perhaps already at the gate, his head was going to split open with the pain
from his scar —
The snake lunged as he took a running leap, dragging Hermione with him;
as it struck, Hermione screamed, 
“Confringo!” 
and her spell flew around the
room, exploding the wardrobe mirror and ricocheting back at them, bouncing
from floor to ceiling; Harry felt the heat of it sear the back of his hand. Glass
cut his cheek as, pulling Hermione with him, he leapt from bed to broken
dressing t e of Madam
Pince’s shoes as the librarian prowled the aisles menacingly, breathing down
the necks of those touching her precious books.
Harry felt shivery; his scar was still aching, he felt almost feverish. When
he sat down opposite Ron and Hermione he caught sight of himself in the
window opposite. He was very white, and his scar seemed to be showing up
more clearly than usual.
“How did it go?” Hermione whispered, and then, looking concerned, “Are
you all right, Harry?”
“Yeah . . . fine . . . I dunno,” said Harry impatiently, wincing as pain shot
through his scar again. “Listen . . . I’ve just realized something . . .”
And he told them what he had just seen and deduced.“So . . . so, are you saying . . .” whispered Ron, as Madam Pince swept
past, squeaking slightly, “that the weapon — the thing You-Know-Who’s after
— is in the Ministry of Magic?”
“In the Department of Mysteries, it’s got to be,” Harry whispered. “I saw
that door when your dad took me down to the courtrooms for my hearing and
it’s definitely  ROUS”

writes Rita Skeeter, Special Correspondent.
Alarming evidence has recently come to light about Harry Potter’s
strange behavior, which casts doubts upon his suitability to compete
in a demanding competition like the Triwizard Tournament, or even
to attend Hogwarts School.
Potter, the 
Daily Prophet
 can exclusively reveal, regularly
collapses at school, and is often heard to complain of pain in the
scar on his forehead (relic of the curse with which You-Know-Who
attempted to kill him). On Monday last, midway through a
Divination lesson, your 
Daily Prophet
 reporter witnessed Potter
storming from the class, claiming that his scar was hurting too
badly to continue studying.
It is possible, say top experts at St. Mungo’s Hospital for Magical
Maladies and Injuries, that Potter’s brain was affected by the attack
inflicted upon him by You-Know-Who, and that his insistence that
the scar is still hurting is an expression of his d"

Moody swept the dead spider off the desk onto the floor.
“Not nice,” he said calmly. “Not pleasant. And there’s no countercurse.
There’s no blocking it. Only one known person has ever survived it, and he’s
sitting right in front of me.”
Harry felt his face redden as Moody’s eyes (both of them) looked into his
own. He could feel everyone else looking around at him too. Harry stared at
the blank blackboard as though fascinated by it, but not really seeing it at
all. . . .
So that was how his parents had died . . . exactly like that spider. Had they
been unblemished and unmarked too? Had they simply seen the flash of green
light and heard the rush of speeding death, before life was wiped from their
bodies?
Harry had been picturing his parents’ deaths over and over again for three
years now, ever since he’d found out they had been murdered, ever since he’d
found out what had happened that night: Wormtail had betrayed his parents’
whereabouts to Voldemort, who had come to find them at their cottage. How  the end of July, nearly
sixteen years ago. This boy would be born to parents who had already defied
Voldemort three times.”
Harry felt as though something was closing in upon him. His breathing
seemed difficult again.
“It means — me?”
Dumbledore took a deep breath.
“The odd thing is, Harry,” he said softly, “that it may not have meant you at
all. Sybill’s prophecy could have applied to two wizard boys, both born at the
end of July that year, both of whom had parents in the Order of the Phoenix,
both sets of parents having narrowly escaped Voldemort three times. One, of
course, was you. The other was Neville Longbottom.”
“But then . . . but then, why was it my name on the prophecy and not
Neville’s?”
“The official record was relabeled after Voldemort’s attack on you as a
child,” said Dumbledore. “It seemed plain to the keeper of the Hall of
Prophecy that Voldemort could only have tried to kill you because he knew
you to be the one to whom Sybill was referring.”
“Then — it might not be me?” said Harry.“I am af den Forest, Harry

“I was only saying — she was with the others, they were with Hagrid —”
“Yeah, I get it, you don’t care! And what about the rest of my family, ‘the
Weasleys don’t need another kid injured,’ did you hear that?”
“Yeah, I —”
“Not bothered what it meant, though?”
“Ron!” said Hermione, forcing her way between them. “I don’t think it
means anything new has happened, anything we don’t know about; think,
Ron, Bill’s already scarred, plenty of people must have seen that George has
lost an ear by now, and you’re supposed to be on your deathbed with
spattergroit, I’m sure that’s all he meant —”“Oh, you’re sure, are you? Right then, well, I won’t bother myself about
them. It’s all right for you two, isn’t it, with your parents safely out of the way
—”
“My parents are 
dead
!” Harry bellowed.
“And mine could be going the same way!” yelled Ron.
“Then GO!” roared Harry. “Go back t l
area, just in case. So, we’ve given a dozen different houses every protection
we can throw at them. They all look like they could be the place we’re going
to hide you, they’ve all got some connection with the Order: my house,
Kingsley’s place, Molly’s Auntie Muriel’s — you get the idea.”
“Yeah,” said Harry, not entirely truthfully, because he could still spot a
gaping hole in the plan.
“You’ll be going to Tonks’s parents. Once you’re within the boundaries of
the protective enchantments we’ve put on their house, you’ll be able to use a
Portkey to the Burrow. Any questions?”
“Er — yes,” said Harry. “Maybe they won’t know which of the twelve
secure houses I’m heading for at first, but won’t it be sort of obvious once” —
he performed a quick headcount — “fourteen of us fly off toward Tonks’s
parents’?”
“Ah,” said Moody, “I forgot to mention the key point. Fourteen of us won’t
be flying to Tonks’s parents’. There will be seven Harry Potters moving
through the skies tonight, each of them with a companion, each pa hould find this easier from next week — again, see the

to help Professor Umbridge now may be very well placed for Head
Boyship in a couple of years!
I am sorry that I was unable to see more of you over the summer. It
pains me to criticize our parents, but I am afraid I can no longer live
under their roof while they remain mixed up with the dangerous crowd
around Dumbledore (if you are writing to Mother at any point, you might
tell her that a certain Sturgis Podmore, who is a great friend of
Dumbledore’s, has recently been sent to Azkaban for trespass at theMinistry. Perhaps that will open their eyes to the kind of petty criminals
with whom they are currently rubbing shoulders). I count myself very
lucky to have escaped the stigma of association with such people — the
Minister really could not be more gracious to me — and I do hope, Ron,
that you will not allow family ties to blind you to the misguided nature of
our parents’ belie couldn’t be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet.
Until they were, he couldn’t risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food.
He’d lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years, as long
as he could remember, ever since he’d been a baby and his parents had died in
that car crash. He couldn’t remember being in the car when his parents had
died. Sometimes, when he strained his memory during long hours in his
cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a blinding flash of green light
and a burning pain on his forehead. This, he supposed, was the crash, though
he couldn’t imagine where all the green light came from. He couldn’t
remember his parents at all. His aunt and uncle never spoke about them, and
of course he was forbidden to ask questions. There were no photographs of
them in the house.
When he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some
unknown relation coming to take him away, but it had never happened; the
Dursleys were his only family. Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped)

what he did?”
Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia were looking extremely tense. Dudley had
even looked up from his pie to gape at his parents.
“He — didn’t work,” said Uncle Vernon, with half a glance at Harry.
“Unemployed.”
“As I expected!” said Aunt Marge, taking a huge swig of brandy and
wiping her chin on her sleeve. “A no-account, good-for-nothing, lazy
scrounger who —”
“He was not,” said Harry suddenly. The table went very quiet. Harry was
shaking all over. He had never felt so angry in his life.
“MORE BRANDY!” yelled Uncle Vernon, who had gone very white. He
emptied the bottle into Aunt Marge’s glass. “You, boy,” he snarled at Harry.
“Go to bed, go on —”
“No, Vernon,” hiccuped Aunt Marge, holding up a hand, her tiny bloodshot
eyes fixed on Harry’s. “Go on, boy, go on. Proud of your parents, are you?
They go and get themselves killed in a car crash (drunk, I expect) —”“They didn’t die in a car crash!” said Harry, who found himsel  even seen CVs . . .” began Uncle Vernon, but Harry lost patience.
Getting to his feet, he advanced on his uncle, now pointing at the TV set
himself.
“These accidents aren’t accidents — the crashes and explosions and
derailments and whatever else has happened since we last watched the news.
People are disappearing and dying and he’s behind it — Voldemort. I’ve told
you this over and over again, he kills Muggles for fun. Even the fogs —
they’re caused by dementors, and if you can’t remember what they are, ask
your son!”
Dudley’s hands jerked upward to cover his mouth. With his parents’ and
Harry’s eyes upon him, he slowly lowered them again and asked, “There
are . . . more of them?”
“More?” laughed Harry. “More than the two that attacked us, you mean?
Of course there are, there are hundreds, maybe thousands by this time, seeing
as they feed off fear and despair —”
“All right, all right,” blustered Vernon Dursley. “You’ve made your point

Hermione, who maintained a rigidly disapproving expression throughout and
refused to talk at all if Harry had used the 
Muffliato
 spell on anyone in the
vicinity.
Sitting up in bed, Harry turned the book sideways so as to examine more
closely the scribbled instructions for a spell that seemed to have caused the
Prince some trouble. There were many crossings-out and alterations, but
finally, crammed into a corner of the page, the scribble:
Levicorpus (nvbl)
While the wind and sleet pounded relentlessly on the windows, and Neville
snored loudly, Harry stared at the letters in brackets. 
Nvbl . . . 
that had to
mean “nonverbal.” Harry rather doubted he would be able to bring off this
particular spell; he was still having difficulty with nonverbal spells,
something Snape had been quick to comment on in every D.A.D.A. class. On
the other hand, the Prince had proved a much more effective teacher than
Snape so far.
Pointing his wand at nothing in particular, he gave it an upward flick and
said 
Levicorp odd
socks — with the obvious exception of the Dursleys’, which consisted of a
single tissue, an all-time low — Harry supposed they too were remembering
the Ton-Tongue Toffee. Hermione had given Harry a book called 
Quidditch
Teams of Britain and Ireland;
 Ron, a bulging bag of Dungbombs; Sirius, a
handy penknife with attachments to unlock any lock and undo any knot; andHagrid, a vast box of sweets including all Harry’s favorites: Bertie Bott’s
Every Flavor Beans, Chocolate Frogs, Drooble’s Best Blowing Gum, and
Fizzing Whizbees. There was also, of course, Mrs. Weasley’s usual package,
including a new sweater (green, with a picture of a dragon on it — Harry
supposed Charlie had told her all about the Horntail), and a large quantity of
homemade mince pies.
Harry and Ron met up with Hermione in the common room, and they went
down to breakfast together. They spent most of the morning in Gryffindor
Tower, where everyone was enjoying their presents, then returned to the Great
Hall for a magnificent lunch, which inc ses?”
“Did you see his face?”
“Did you see his scar?”
Whispers followed Harry from the moment he left his dormitory the next
day. People lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him,
or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again, staring. Harry wished they
wouldn’t, because he was trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes.
There were a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts: wide,
sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere different on a
Friday; some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to
jump. Then there were doors that wouldn’t open unless you asked politely, or
tickled them in exactly the right place, and doors that weren’t really doors at
all, but solid walls just pretending. It was also very hard to remember where
anything was, because it all seemed to move around a lot. The people in the
portraits kept going to visit each other, and Harry was sure the coats of armor
could walk.The ghosts didn’t help, either. It was always  ntions. You know I
wouldn’t’ve used a spell like that, not even on Malfoy, but you can’t blame
the Prince, he hadn’t written ‘try this out, it’s really good’ — he was just
making notes for himself, wasn’t he, not for anyone else. . . .”
“Are you telling me,” said Hermione, “that you’re going to go back — ?”
“And get the book? Yeah, I am,” said Harry forcefully. “Listen, without the
Prince I’d never have won the Felix Felicis. I’d never have known how to
save Ron from poisoning, I’d never have —”
“— got a reputation for Potions brilliance you don’t deserve,” said
Hermione nastily.
“Give it a rest, Hermione!” said Ginny, and Harry was so amazed, so
grateful, he looked up. “By the sound of it, Malfoy was trying to use an
Unforgivable Curse, you should be glad Harry had something good up his
sleeve!”
“Well, of course I’m glad Harry wasn’t cursed!” said Hermione, clearly
stung. “But you can’t call that Sectumsempra spell good, Ginny, look where
it’s landed him! And I’d have thought, seeing what this has done to yo ,” she added, as Harry and Ron rolled their eyes, “because I’m
starting to think this Prince character was a bit dodgy.”
Both Harry and Ron shouted her down at once.
“It was a laugh!” said Ron, upending a ketchup bottle over his sausages.
“Just a laugh, Hermione, that’s all!”
“Dangling people upside down by the ankle?” said Hermione. “Who puts
their time and energy into making up spells like that?”
“Fred and George,” said Ron, shrugging, “it’s their kind of thing. And, er
—”
“My dad,” said Harry. He had only just remembered.
“What?” said Ron and Hermione together.
“My dad used this spell,” said Harry. “I — Lupin told me.”
This last part was not true; in fact, Harry had seen his father use the spell
on Snape, but he had never told Ron and Hermione about that particular
excursion into the Pensieve. Now, however, a wonderful possibility occurred
to him. Could the Half-Blood Prince possibly be — ?
“Maybe your dad did use it, Harry,” said Hermione, “but he’s not the only
one. We’ve seen a whole bunch of people use  — Pillsworth, I think they said —”
“Yes, a lot of offices have been raining lately,” said Mr. Weasley. “Did you
try Meteolojinx Recanto? It worked for Bletchley.”
“Meteolojinx Recanto?” whispered Ron. “No, I didn’t. Thanks, D — I
mean, thanks, Arthur.”
The lift doors opened; the old witch with the anthill hair left, and Ron
darted past her out of sight. Harry made to follow him, but found his path
blocked as Percy Weasley strode into the lift, his nose buried in some papers
he was reading.
Not until the doors had clanged shut again did Percy realize he was in a lift
with his father. He glanced up, saw Mr. Weasley, turned radish red, and left
the lift the moment the doors opened again. For the second time, Harry tried
to get out, but this time found his way blocked by Mr. Weasley’s arm.
“One moment, Runcorn.”
The lift doors closed and as they clanked down another floor, Mr. Weasley
said, “I hear you laid information about Dirk Cresswell.”
Harry had the impression that Mr. Weasley’s anger was no less because o eted. Harry fully expected to receive low marks
on his, because he had disagreed with Snape on the best way to tackle
dementors, but he did not care: Slughorn’s memory was the most important
thing to him now.
“I’m telling you, the stupid Prince isn’t going to be able to help you with
this, Harry!” said Hermione, more loudly. “There’s only one way to force
someone to do what you want, and that’s the Imperius Curse, which is illegal
—”
“Yeah, I know that, thanks,” said Harry, not looking up from the book.
“That’s why I’m looking for something different. Dumbledore says
Veritaserum won’t do it, but there might be something else, a potion or a
spell. . . .”
“You’re going about it the wrong way,” said Hermione. “Only you can get
the memory, Dumbledore says. That must mean you can persuade Slughorn
where other people can’t. It’s not a question of slipping him a potion, anyone
could do that —”“How d’you spell ‘belligerent’?” said Ron, shaking his quill very hard
while staring at his parchment. “It can’t be B — U — M -shifter exploded in a wisp of smoke.
The silver stag faded from sight. Harry wished it could have stayed, he could
have used some company . . . but he moved on, quickly and quietly as
possible, listening hard, his wand held high once more.
Left . . . right . . . left again . . . Twice he found himself facing dead ends.
He did the Four-Point Spell again and found that he was going too far east.
He turned back, took a right turn, and saw an odd golden mist floating ahead
of him.
Harry approached it cautiously, pointing the wand’s beam at it. This looked
like some kind of enchantment. He wondered whether he might be able to
blast it out of the way.
“Reducto!”
 he said.
The spell shot straight through the mist, leaving it intact. He supposed he
should have known better; the Reductor Curse was for solid objects. What
would happen if he walked through the mist? Was it worth chancing it, or
should he double back?
He was still hesitating when a scream shattered the silence.
“Fleur?” Harry yelled.
There was silence. "
What does the Imperius Curse do?,Controls the victim,"The Imperius Curse is a powerful and complex spell that allows the caster to control the actions of another person, making them do or say whatever the caster desires.","ne of your throats . . .”
Ron gave an involuntary shudder.
“Years back, there were a lot of witches and wizards being controlled by
the Imperius Curse,” said Moody, and Harry knew he was talking about the
days in which Voldemort had been all-powerful. “Some job for the Ministry,
trying to sort out who was being forced to act, and who was acting of their
own free will.
“The Imperius Curse can be fought, and I’ll be teaching you how, but it
takes real strength of character, and not everyone’s got it. Better avoid beinghit with it if you can. CONSTANT VIGILANCE!” he barked, and everyone
jumped.
Moody picked up the somersaulting spider and threw it back into the jar.
“Anyone else know one? Another illegal curse?”
Hermione’s hand flew into the air again and so, to Harry’s slight surprise,
did Neville’s. The only class in which Neville usually volunteered
information was Herbology, which was easily his best subject. Neville looked
surprised at his own daring.
“Yes?” said Moody, his magical eye rolling right over to  a raid on his
Clapham home . . .’”
“Stan Shunpike, a Death Eater?” said Harry, remembering the spotty youth
he had first met three years before. “No way!”
“He might have been put under the Imperius Curse,” said Ron reasonably.
“You never can tell.”
“It doesn’t look like it,” said Hermione, who was still reading. “It says here
he was arrested after he was overheard talking about the Death Eaters’ secret
plans in a pub.” She looked up with a troubled expression on her face. “If he
was under the Imperius Curse, he’d hardly stand around gossiping about their
plans, would he?”
“It sounds like he was trying to make out he knew more than he did,” said
Ron. “Isn’t he the one who claimed he was going to become Minister ofMagic when he was trying to chat up those veela?”
“Yeah, that’s him,” said Harry. “I dunno what they’re playing at, taking
Stan seriously.”
“They probably want to look as though they’re doing something,” said
Hermione, frowning. “People are terrified — you know the Patil twins’
parents want them to g  the trunk with Moody,
and set off for Hogwarts. I kept him alive, under the Imperius Curse. I wanted
to be able to question him. To find out about his past, learn his habits, so that I
could fool even Dumbledore. I also needed his hair to make the Polyjuice
Potion. The other ingredients were easy. I stole boomslang skin from the
dungeons. When the Potions master found me in his office, I said I was under
orders to search it.”“And what became of Wormtail after you attacked Moody?” said
Dumbledore.
“Wormtail returned to care for my master, in my father’s house, and to keep
watch over my father.”
“But your father escaped,” said Dumbledore.
“Yes. After a while he began to fight the Imperius Curse just as I had done.
There were periods when he knew what was happening. My master decided it
was no longer safe for my father to leave the house. He forced him to send
letters to the Ministry instead. He made him write and say he was ill. But
Wormtail neglected his duty. He was not watchful enough. My father escaped.
My curse on you isn’t going to tell you what he’s about to do. He’s not
going to do it nice and polite to your face. You need to be prepared. You need
to be alert and watchful. You need to put that away, Miss Brown, when I’m
talking.”
Lavender jumped and blushed. She had been showing Parvati her
completed horoscope under the desk. Apparently Moody’s magical eye could
see through solid wood, as well as out of the back of his head.
“So . . . do any of you know which curses are most heavily punished by
Wizarding law?”
Several hands rose tentatively into the air, including Ron’s and Hermione’s.
Moody pointed at Ron, though his magical eye was still fixed on Lavender.
“Er,” said Ron tentatively, “my dad told me about one. . . . Is it called theImperius Curse, or something?”
“Ah, yes,” said Moody appreciatively. “Your father 
would
 know that one.
Gave the Ministry a lot of trouble at one time, the Imperius Curse.”
Moody got heavily to his mismatched feet, opened his desk drawer, and
took out a glass jar. Three large  ate step. He
had had much more difficulty with the curse than Harry, though Moodyassured him the effects would wear off by lunchtime. “Talk about
paranoid . . .” Ron glanced nervously over his shoulder to check that Moody
was definitely out of earshot and went on. “No wonder they were glad to get
shot of him at the Ministry. Did you hear him telling Seamus what he did to
that witch who shouted ‘Boo’ behind him on April Fools’ Day? And when are
we supposed to read up on resisting the Imperius Curse with everything else
we’ve got to do?”
All the fourth years had noticed a definite increase in the amount of work
they were required to do this term. Professor McGonagall explained why,
when the class gave a particularly loud groan at the amount of Transfiguration
homework she had assigned.
“You are now entering a most important phase of your magical education!”
she told them, her eyes glinting dangerously behind her square spectacles.
“Your Ordinary Wizarding Levels are drawing closer —”
“We don’t take O.W.L.s till t.
Mungo’s, his brain had gone all funny and he couldn’t talk. But remember
what the Healer told us? He was recovering. And they couldn’t risk him
getting better, could they? I mean, the shock of whatever happened when he
touched that weapon probably made the Imperius Curse lift. Once he’d got his
voice back, he’d explain what he’d been doing, wouldn’t he? They would
have known he’d been sent to steal the weapon. Of course, it would have been
easy for Lucius Malfoy to put the curse on him. Never out of the Ministry, is
he?”
“He was even hanging around that day I had my hearing,” said Harry. “In
the — hang on . . .” he said slowly. “He was in the Department of Mysteries
corridor that day! Your dad said he was probably trying to sneak down and
find out what happened in my hearing, but what if —”
“Sturgis,” gasped Hermione, looking thunderstruck.
“Sorry?” said Ron, looking bewildered.
“Sturgis Podmore,” said Hermione, breathlessly. “Arrested for trying to get
through a door. Lucius Malfoy got him too. I bet he d eted. Harry fully expected to receive low marks
on his, because he had disagreed with Snape on the best way to tackle

why
 did you put on that ring? It
carries a curse, surely you realized that. Why even touch it?”
Marvolo Gaunt’s ring lay on the desk before Dumbledore. It was cracked;
the sword of Gryffindor lay beside it.
Dumbledore grimaced.
“I . . . was a fool. Sorely tempted . . .”
“Tempted by what?”
Dumbledore did not answer.
“It is a miracle you managed to return here!” Snape sounded furious. “That
ring carried a curse of extraordinary power, to contain it is all we can hope
for; I have trapped the curse in one hand for the time being —”
Dumbledore raised his blackened, useless hand, and examined it with the
expression of one being shown an interesting curio.
“You have done very well, Severus. How long do you think I have?”
Dumbledore’s tone was conversational; he might have been asking for a
weather forecast. Snape hesitated, and then said, “I cannot tell. Maybe a year.
There is no halting such a spell forever. It will spread eventually, it is the sort
of curse that strengthens over time.”

“Five points from Gryffindor!” Percy said tersely, fingering his prefect
badge. “And I hope it teaches you a lesson! No more 
detective work,
 or I’ll
write to Mum!”
And he strode off, the back of his neck as red as Ron’s ears.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione chose seats as far as possible from Percy in the
common room that night. Ron was still in a very bad temper and kept blotting
his Charms homework. When he reached absently for his wand to remove the
smudges, it ignited the parchment. Fuming almost as much as his homework,
Ron slammed 
The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 2
 shut. To Harry’s surprise,
Hermione followed suit.
“Who can it be, though?” she said in a quiet voice, as though continuing a
conversation they had just been having. “Who’d 
want
 to frighten all the
Squibs and Muggle-borns out of Hogwarts?”
“Let’s think,” said Ron in mock puzzlement. “Who do we know who thinks
Muggle-b ille laughed gleefully.
“What did you do with the dragon?”
“Released it into the wild,” said Ron. “Hermione was all for keeping it as a
pet —”
“Don’t exaggerate, Ron —”
“But what have you been doing? People have been saying you’ve just been
on the run, Harry, but I don’t think so. I think you’ve been up to something.”
“You’re right,” said Harry, “but tell us about Hogwarts, Neville, we haven’theard anything.”
“It’s been . . . well, it’s not really like Hogwarts anymore,” said Neville, the
smile fading from his face as he spoke. “Do you know about the Carrows?”
“Those two Death Eaters who teach here?”
“They do more than teach,” said Neville. “They’re in charge of all
discipline. They like punishment, the Carrows.”
“Like Umbridge?”
“Nah, they make her look tame. The other teachers are all supposed to refer
us to the Carrows if we do anything wrong. They don’t, though, if they can
avoid it. You can tell they all hate them as much as we do.

and there were directions for what looked like spells that the Prince had made

“Or herself,” said Hermione irritably, overhearing Harry pointing some of
these out to Ron in the common room on Saturday evening. “It might have
been a girl. I think the handwriting looks more like a girl’s than a boy’s.”“The Half-Blood 
Prince,
 he was called,” Harry said. “How many girls have
been Princes?”
Hermione seemed to have no answer to this. She merely scowled and
twitched her essay on 
The Principles of Rematerialization
 away from Ron,
who was trying to read it upside down.
Harry looked at his watch and hurriedly put the old copy of 
Advanced
Potion-Making
 back into his bag.
“It’s five to eight, I’d better go, I’ll be late for Dumbledore.”
“Ooooh!” gasped Hermione, looking up at once. “Good luck! We’ll wait
up, we want to hear what he teaches you!”
“Hope it goes okay,” said Ron, and the pair of them watched Harry leave
through the portrait hole.
Harry proceeded through very important!” said Hermione, shocked.
“Not the way Lockhart teaches it,” said Ron. “I haven’t learned anything
from him except not to set pixies loose.”
Neville Longbottom had been sent letters from all the witches and wizards
in his family, all giving him different advice on what to choose. Confused and
worried, he sat reading the subject lists with his tongue poking out, asking
people whether they thought Arithmancy sounded more difficult than Study
of Ancient Runes. Dean Thomas, who, like Harry, had grown up with
Muggles, ended up closing his eyes and jabbing his wand at the list, then
picking the subjects it landed on. Hermione took nobody’s advice but signed
up for everything.
Harry smiled grimly to himself at the thought of what Uncle Vernon and
Aunt Petunia would say if he tried to discuss his career in wizardry with them.
Not that he didn’t get any guidance: Percy Weasley was eager to share his
experience.
“Depends where you want to 
go
, Harry,” he said. “It’s never too early to
think about the fu wn hair was flecked with gray.
“Who d’you reckon he is?” Ron hissed as they sat down and slid the door
shut, taking the seats farthest away from the window.
“Professor R. J. Lupin,” whispered Hermione at once.
“How d’you know that?”
“It’s on his case,” she replied, pointing at the luggage rack over the man’s
head, where there was a small, battered case held together with a largequantity of neatly knotted string. The name 
Professor R. J. Lupin
 was
stamped across one corner in peeling letters.
“Wonder what he teaches?” said Ron, frowning at Professor Lupin’s pallid
profile.
“That’s obvious,” whispered Hermione. “There’s only one vacancy, isn’t
there? Defense Against the Dark Arts.”
Harry, Ron, and Hermione had already had two Defense Against the Dark
Arts teachers, both of whom had lasted only one year. There were rumors that
the job was jinxed.
“Well, I hope he’s up to it,” said Ron doubtfully. “He looks like one good
hex would finish him off, doesn’t he? Anyway . . .” He turned to Harry.
“What were you goin rts, except now it’s just the Dark Arts. We’re supposed to practice the
Cruciatus Curse on people who’ve earned detentions —”
“What?”
Harry, Ron, and Hermione’s united voices echoed up and down the
passage.
“Yeah,” said Neville. “That’s how I got this one,” he pointed at a
particularly deep gash in his cheek, “I refused to do it. Some people are into
it, though; Crabbe and Goyle love it. First time they’ve ever been top in
anything, I expect.
“Alecto, Amycus’s sister, teaches Muggle Studies, which is compulsory for
everyone. We’ve all got to listen to her explain how Muggles are like animals,
stupid and dirty, and how they drove wizards into hiding by being vicious
toward them, and how the natural order is being reestablished. I got this one,”
he indicated another slash to his face, “for asking her how much Muggle
blood she and her brother have got.”
“Blimey, Neville,” said Ron, “there’s a time and a place for getting a smart
mouth.”
“You didn’t hear her,” said Neville. “You wouldn’t have stood it either. The between them this year,”
said Professor McGonagall, a hint of disapproval in her voice; it was common
knowledge that she despised the subject of Divination. “The sixth year is
being taken by Professor Trelawney.”
Parvati set off for Divination five minutes later looking slightly crestfallen.
“So, Potter, Potter . . .” said Professor McGonagall, consulting her notes as
she turned to Harry. “Charms, Defense Against the Dark Arts, Herbology,
Transfiguration . . . all fine. I must say, I was pleased with your
Transfiguration mark, Potter, very pleased. Now, why haven’t you applied to
continue with Potions? I thought it was your ambition to become an Auror?”
“It was, but you told me I had to get an ‘Outstanding’ in my O.W.L.,
Professor.”
“And so you did when Professor Snape was teaching the subject. Professor
Slughorn, however, is perfectly happy to accept N.E.W.T. students with
‘Exceeds Expectations’ at O.W.L. Do you wish to proceed with Potions?”
“Yes,” said Harry, “but I didn’t buy the books or any ingredients  “Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder he’s looking so
nervous, that’s Professor Snape. He teaches Potions, but he doesn’t want to —
everyone knows he’s after Quirrell’s job. Knows an awful lot about the Dark
Arts, Snape.”
Harry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn’t look at him again.
At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to his
feet again. The hall fell silent.
“Ahem — just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I
have a few start-of-term notices to give you.
“First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all
pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember that aswell.”
Dumbledore’s twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley twins.
“I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that
no magic should be used between classes in the corridors.
“Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone
interested in playing for their House teams should contact Mad"
What does the Polyjuice Potion do?,Transforms the drinker into someone else,"The Polyjuice Potion is a magical potion that can transform the drinker into someone else. It was first mentioned in a Potions lesson taught by Professor Slughorn, and Hermione later suggested using it to disguise themselves as Slytherins in order to question Malfoy.","ng. . . .”
“Yeah, that is weird,” said Harry, frowning. “I heard him telling Crabbe it
wasn’t Crabbe’s business what he was doing . . . so what’s he telling all
these . . . all these . . .”
Harry’s voice tailed away; he was staring at the fire.
“God, I’ve been stupid,” he said quietly. “It’s obvious, isn’t it? There was a
great vat of it down in the dungeon. . . . He could’ve nicked some any time
during that lesson. . . .”
“Nicked what?” said Ron.
“Polyjuice Potion. He stole some of the Polyjuice Potion Slughorn showed
us in our first Potions lesson. . . . There aren’t a whole variety of students
standing guard for Malfoy . . . it’s just Crabbe and Goyle as usual. . . . Yeah, it
all fits!” said Harry, jumping up and starting to pace in front of the fire.
“They’re stupid enough to do what they’re told even if he won’t tell them
what he’s up to . . . but he doesn’t want them to be seen lurking around
outside the Room of Requirement, so he’s got them taking Polyjuice to make
them look like other people. . . . Th  a month or so, you feel like explaining, you will let us know, won’t
you?” said Ron irritably.
“All right,” said Hermione coldly. “What we’d need to do is to get inside
the Slytherin common room and ask Malfoy a few questions without him
realizing it’s us.”
“But that’s impossible,” Harry said as Ron laughed.
“No, it’s not,” said Hermione. “All we’d need would be some Polyjuice
Potion.”
“What’s that?” said Ron and Harry together.
“Snape mentioned it in class a few weeks ago —”
“D’you think we’ve got nothing better to do in Potions than listen to
Snape?” muttered Ron.
“It transforms you into somebody else. Think about it! We could change
into three of the Slytherins. No one would know it was us. Malfoy would
probably tell us anything. He’s probably boasting about it in the Slytherin
common room right now, if only we could hear him.”
“This Polyjuice stuff sounds a bit dodgy to me,” said Ron, frowning. “What
if we were stuck looking like three of the Slytherins forever?”
“It wears off after a while,” said Hermio  way, please, Harry,” said Dumbledore. He raised his wand and
made complicated movements over the surface of the potion, murmuring
soundlessly. Nothing happened, except perhaps that the potion glowed a little
brighter. Harry remained silent while Dumbledore worked, but after a while
Dumbledore withdrew his wand, and Harry felt it was safe to talk again.
“You think the Horcrux is in there, sir?”
“Oh yes.” Dumbledore peered more closely into the basin. Harry saw his
face reflected, upside down, in the smooth surface of the green potion. “But
how to reach it? This potion cannot be penetrated by hand, Vanished, parted,
scooped up, or siphoned away, nor can it be Transfigured, Charmed, or
otherwise made to change its nature.”
Almost absentmindedly, Dumbledore raised his wand again, twirled it once
in midair, and then caught the crystal goblet that he had conjured out of
nowhere.
“I can only conclude that this potion is supposed to be drunk.”
“What?” said Harry. “No!”
“Yes, I think so: Only by drinking it can I emp ky remained on her knees, trembling, her hands over her face.
Dumbledore forced the man’s mouth open and poured three drops inside it.
Then he pointed his wand at the man’s chest and said, 
“Rennervate.”
Crouch’s son opened his eyes. His face was slack, his gaze unfocused.
Dumbledore knelt before him, so that their faces were level.
“Can you hear me?” Dumbledore asked quietly.
The man’s eyelids flickered.
“Yes,” he muttered.
“I would like you to tell us,” said Dumbledore softly, “how you came to be
here. How did you escape from Azkaban?”
Crouch took a deep, shuddering breath, then began to speak in a flat,
expressionless voice.
“My mother saved me. She knew she was dying. She persuaded my father
to rescue me as a last favor to her. He loved her as he had never loved me. He
agreed. They came to visit me. They gave me a draught of Polyjuice Potion
containing one of my mother’s hairs. She took a draught of Polyjuice Potion
containing one of my hairs. We took on each other’s appearance.”
Winky was shaking her hea see him, but
he seems in no immediate danger.”
Harry did as he was told; Dumbledore covered Moody in the cloak, tucked
it around him, and clambered out of the trunk again. Then he picked up the
hip flask that stood upon the desk, unscrewed it, and turned it over. A thick
glutinous liquid splattered onto the office floor.
“Polyjuice Potion, Harry,” said Dumbledore. “You see the simplicity of it,and the brilliance. For Moody never 
does
 drink except from his hip flask, he’s
well known for it. The imposter needed, of course, to keep the real Moody
close by, so that he could continue making the potion. You see his hair . . .”
Dumbledore looked down on the Moody in the trunk. “The imposter has been
cutting it off all year, see where it is uneven? But I think, in the excitement of
tonight, our fake Moody might have forgotten to take it as frequently as he
should have done . . . on the hour . . . every hour. . . . We shall see.”
Dumbledore pulled out the chair at the desk and sat down upon it, his eyes
fixed upon t letely clear potion. Harry stared at it.
“Do you know what this is, Potter?” Snape said, his eyes glittering
dangerously again.
“No,” said Harry, with complete honesty this time.
“It is Veritaserum — a Truth Potion so powerful that three drops would
have you spilling your innermost secrets for this entire class to hear,” said
Snape viciously. “Now, the use of this potion is controlled by very strict
Ministry guidelines. But unless you watch your step, you might just find that
my hand 
slips
” — he shook the crystal bottle slightly — “right over your
evening pumpkin juice. And then, Potter . . . then we’ll find out whether
you’ve been in my office or not.”
Harry said nothing. He turned back to his ginger roots once more, picked
up his knife, and started slicing them again. He didn’t like the sound of thatTruth Potion at all, nor would he put it past Snape to slip him some. He
repressed a shudder at the thought of what might come spilling out of his
mouth if Snape did it . . . quite apart from landing a whole l nd
raising the empty goblet, “you have my orders.”
“Why can’t I drink the potion instead?” asked Harry desperately.
“Because I am much older, much cleverer, and much less valuable,” said
Dumbledore. “Once and for all, Harry, do I have your word that you will do
all in your power to make me keep drinking?”
“Couldn’t — ?”
“Do I have it?”
“But —”
“Your word, Harry.”
“I — all right, but —”
Before Harry could make any further protest, Dumbledore lowered the
crystal goblet into the potion. For a split second, Harry hoped that he would
not be able to touch the potion with the goblet, but the crystal sank into the
surface as nothing else had; when the glass was full to the brim, Dumbledore
lifted it to his mouth.
“Your good health, Harry.”
And he drained the goblet. Harry watched, terrified, his hands gripping the
rim of the basin so hard that his fingertips were numb.
“Professor?” he said anxiously, as Dumbledore lowered the empty glass.
“How do you feel?”
Dumbledore shook his head, his eyes closed. Harry wondered w smelling green onion, a pointed purple crystal, and a
rotting newt tail before the other Gryffindor boys pointed out that he was in
no danger; he was a pureblood, and therefore unlikely to be attacked.
“They went for Filch first,” Neville said, his round face fearful. “And
everyone knows I’m almost a Squib.”In the second week of December Professor McGonagall came around as
usual, collecting names of those who would be staying at school for
Christmas. Harry, Ron, and Hermione signed her list; they had heard that
Malfoy was staying, which struck them as very suspicious. The holidays
would be the perfect time to use the Polyjuice Potion and try to worm a
confession out of him.
Unfortunately, the potion was only half finished. They still needed the
bicorn horn and the boomslang skin, and the only place they were going to get
them was from Snape’s private stores. Harry privately felt he’d rather face
Slytherin’s legendary monster than let Snape catch him robbing his office.
“What we need,” said Hermione briskly as"
What is the name of Voldemort's snake?,Nagini,"According to the context, the name of Voldemort's snake is not explicitly mentioned, but it is referred to as ""the snake"" or "" Nagini"" in the context of the conversation.","n she took you upstairs? Was
the snake hiding somewhere? Did it just come out and kill her and attackyou?”
“No,” he said. “
She
 was the snake . . . or the snake was her . . . all along.”
“W-what?”
He closed his eyes. He could still smell Bathilda’s house on him: It made
the whole thing horribly vivid.
“Bathilda must’ve been dead a while. The snake was . . . was inside her.
You-Know-Who put it there in Godric’s Hollow, to wait. You were right. He
knew I’d go back.”
“The snake was
 inside 
her?”
He opened his eyes again: Hermione looked revolted, nauseated.
“Lupin said there would be magic we’d never imagined,” Harry said. “She
didn’t want to talk in front of you, because it was Parseltongue, all
Parseltongue, and I didn’t realize, but of course I could understand her. Once
we were up in the room, the snake sent a message to You-Know-Who, I heard
it happen inside my head, I felt him get excited, he said to keep me there . . .
and then . . .”
He remembered the snake coming out of Bathilda’s neck: Hermione did n e getting
to the bottom of this business. He had moved forward in his chair so that,
without realizing it, he was perched on the very edge, tense as though poised
for flight.
“How come I saw through the snake’s eyes if it’s Voldemort’s thoughts I’m
sharing?”
“Do not say the Dark Lord’s name!” 
spat Snape.
There was a nasty silence. They glared at each other across the Pensieve.
“Professor Dumbledore says his name,” said Harry quietly.
“Dumbledore is an extremely powerful wizard,” Snape muttered. “While
he 
may feel secure enough to use the name . . . the rest of us . . .” He rubbed
his left forearm, apparently unconsciously, on the spot where Harry knew the
Dark Mark was burned into his skin.
“I just wanted to know,” Harry began again, forcing his voice back to
politeness, “why —”
“You seem to have visited the snake’s mind because that was where the
Dark Lord was at that particular moment,” snarled Snape. “He was possessingthe snake at the time and so you dreamed you were inside it too . . .”
“And Vol — he —  d swiftly away,
clearing the floor.
“Don’t move, Potter,” said Snape lazily, clearly enjoying the sight of Harry
standing motionless, eye to eye with the angry snake. “I’ll get rid of it. . . .”
“Allow me!” shouted Lockhart. He brandished his wand at the snake and
there was a loud bang; the snake, instead of vanishing, flew ten feet into the
air and fell back to the floor with a loud smack. Enraged, hissing furiously, it
slithered straight toward Justin Finch-Fletchley and raised itself again, fangs
exposed, poised to strike.
Harry wasn’t sure what made him do it. He wasn’t even aware of deciding
to do it. All he knew was that his legs were carrying him forward as though hewas on casters and that he had shouted stupidly at the snake, “Leave him
alone!” And miraculously — inexplicably — the snake slumped to the floor,
docile as a thick, black garden hose, its eyes now on Harry. Harry felt the fear
drain out of him. He knew the snake wouldn’t attack anyone now, though how
he knew it, he couldn’t have explained. ying to disturb it
all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the
only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least
he got to visit the rest of the house.
The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised its
head until its eyes were on a level with Harry’s.
It winked.
Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was
watching. They weren’t. He looked back at the snake and winked, too.
The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its
eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly:
“I get that all the time.”“I know,” Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn’t sure the
snake could hear him. “It must be really annoying.”
The snake nodded vigorously.
“Where do you come from, anyway?” Harry asked.
The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry peered at it.
Boa Constrictor, Brazil.
“Was it nice there?”
The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign ag 
come a time when Lord Voldemort will seem to fear for the life of his snake.”
“For Nagini?” Snape looked astonished.
“Precisely. If there comes a time when Lord Voldemort stops sending that
snake forth to do his bidding, but keeps it safe beside him under magicalprotection, then, I think, it will be safe to tell Harry.”
“Tell him what?”
Dumbledore took a deep breath and closed his eyes.
“Tell him that on the night Lord Voldemort tried to kill him, when Lily cast
her own life between them as a shield, the Killing Curse rebounded upon
Lord Voldemort, and a fragment of Voldemort’s soul was blasted apart from
the whole, and latched itself onto the only living soul left in that collapsing
building. Part of Lord Voldemort lives inside Harry, and it is that which gives
him the power of speech with snakes, and a connection with Lord
Voldemort’s mind that he has never understood. And while that fragment of
soul, unmissed by Voldemort, remains attached to and protected by Harry,
Lord Voldemort cannot die.”
Harry seeme es? Did he
expect to see Voldemort staring out of them, afraid, perhaps, that
their vivid green might turn suddenly to scarlet, with catlike slits for pupils?
Harry remembered how the snakelike face of Voldemort had once forced
itself out of the back of Professor Quirrell’s head, and he ran his hand over the
back of his own, wondering what it would feel like if Voldemort burst out of
his skull. . . .
He felt dirty, contaminated, as though he were carrying some deadly germ,
unworthy to sit on the underground train back from the hospital with
innocent, clean people whose minds and bodies were free of the taint of
Voldemort. . . . He had not merely seen the snake, he had 
been 
the snake, he
knew it now. . . .
And then a truly terrible thought occurred to him, a memory bobbing to the
surface of his mind, one that made his insides writhe and squirm like
serpents. . . .
“What’s he after apart from followers?”“Stuff he can only get by stealth . . . like a weapon. Something he didn’t
have last time.”
I’m the weapon, “I forgot,” he said.
“Lucky you,” said Ginny coolly.
“I’m sorry,” Harry said, and he meant it. “So . . . so do you think I’m being
possessed, then?”“Well, can you remember everything you’ve been doing?” Ginny asked.
“Are there big blank periods where you don’t know what you’ve been up to?”
Harry racked his brains.
“No,” he said.
“Then You-Know-Who hasn’t ever possessed you,” said Ginny simply.
“When he did it to me, I couldn’t remember what I’d been doing for hours at
a time. I’d find myself somewhere and not know how I got there.”
Harry hardly dared believe her, yet his heart was lightening almost in spite
of himself.
“That dream I had about your dad and the snake, though —”
“Harry, you’ve had these dreams before,” Hermione said. “You had flashes
of what Voldemort was up to last year.”
“This was different,” said Harry, shaking his head. “I was inside that snake.
It was like I 
was
 the snake. . . . What if Voldemort somehow transported me
to London — ?”
“One day,” said Hermione, sounding thoroughly exasperat rs of his name rearranged
themselves:
I AM LORD VOLDEMORT
“You see?” he whispered. “It was a name I was already using at Hogwarts,
to my most intimate friends only, of course. You think I was going to use my
filthy Muggle father’s name forever? I, in whose veins runs the blood of
Salazar Slytherin himself, through my mother’s side? I, keep the name of a
foul, common Muggle, who abandoned me even before I was born, just
because he found out his wife was a witch? No, Harry — I fashioned myself a
new name, a name I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak,when I had become the greatest sorcerer in the world!”
Harry’s brain seemed to have jammed. He stared numbly at Riddle, at the
orphaned boy who had grown up to murder Harry’s own parents, and so many
others. . . . At last he forced himself to speak.
“You’re not,” he said, his quiet voice full of hatred.
“Not what?” snapped Riddle.
“Not the greatest sorcerer in the world,” said Harry, breathing fast. “Sorry
to disappoint you and all that, but the grea"
Who is the caretaker of Hogwarts?,Argus Filch,The caretaker of Hogwarts is Argus Filch.," excursion carefully, because he had been caught out of
bed and out-of-bounds by Filch the caretaker in the middle of the night once
before, and had no desire to repeat the experience. The Invisibility Cloak
would, of course, be essential, and as an added precaution, Harry thought he
would take the Marauder’s Map, which, next to the Cloak, was the most
useful aid to rule-breaking Harry owned. The map showed the whole of
Hogwarts, including its many shortcuts and secret passageways and, most
important of all, it revealed the people inside the castle as minuscule, labeled
dots, moving around the corridors, so that Harry would be forewarned if
somebody was approaching the bathroom.
On Thursday night, Harry sneaked up to bed, put on the Cloak, crept backdownstairs, and, just as he had done on the night when Hagrid had shown him
the dragons, waited for the portrait hole to open. This time it was Ron who
waited outside to give the Fat Lady the password (“banana fritters”). “Good
luck,” Ron muttered, climbing into t voice, “I’ll see you at the feast. Have a good time.”
He accompanied them to the entrance hall, where Filch, the caretaker, was
standing inside the front doors, checking off names against a long list, peering
suspiciously into every face, and making sure that no one was sneaking out
who shouldn’t be going.
“Staying here, Potter?” shouted Malfoy, who was standing in line with
Crabbe and Goyle. “Scared of passing the dementors?”
Harry ignored him and made his solitary way up the marble staircase,
through the deserted corridors, and back to Gryffindor Tower.
“Password?” said the Fat Lady, jerking out of a doze.
“Fortuna Major,” said Harry listlessly.
The portrait swung open and he climbed through the hole into the common
room. It was full of chattering first and second years, and a few older
students, who had obviously visited Hogsmeade so often the novelty had
worn off.
“Harry! Harry! Hi, Harry!”
It was Colin Creevey, a second year who was deeply in awe of Harry and
never missed an opportunity to speak to him.
 ilch, the caretaker, has asked me to tell you that the list of objects
forbidden inside the castle has this year been extended to include ScreamingYo-yos, Fanged Frisbees, and Ever-Bashing Boomerangs. The full list
comprises some four hundred and thirty-seven items, I believe, and can be
viewed in Mr. Filch’s office, if anybody would like to check it.”
The corners of Dumbledore’s mouth twitched. He continued, “As ever, I
would like to remind you all that the forest on the grounds is out-of-bounds to
students, as is the village of Hogsmeade to all below third year.
“It is also my painful duty to inform you that the Inter-House Quidditch
Cup will not take place this year.”
“What?”
 Harry gasped. He looked around at Fred and George, his fellow
members of the Quidditch team. They were mouthing soundlessly at
Dumbledore, apparently too appalled to speak. Dumbledore went on, “This is
due to an event that will be starting in October, and continuing throughout the
school year, taking up much of the teachers’ time and M

It was a map showing every detail of the Hogwarts castle and grounds. But
the truly remarkable thing were the tiny ink dots moving around it, each
labeled with a name in minuscule writing. Astounded, Harry bent over it. A
labeled dot in the top left corner showed that Professor Dumbledore was
pacing his study; the caretaker’s cat, Mrs. Norris, was prowling the second
floor; and Peeves the Poltergeist was currently bouncing around the trophy
room. And as Harry’s eyes traveled up and down the familiar corridors, he
noticed something else.
This map showed a set of passages he had never entered. And many of
them seemed to lead —
“Right into Hogsmeade,” said Fred, tracing one of them with his finger.
“There are seven in all. Now, Filch knows about these four” — he pointed
them out — “but we’re sure we’re the only ones who know about 
these.
 Don’t
bother with the one behind the mirror on the fourth floor. We used it until last
winter, but it’s caved in — completely blocked. And we don’t reckon
an  once more. Talking
ceased immediately as all turned to face the headmaster. Harry was feeling
pleasantly drowsy now. His four-poster bed was waiting somewhere above,
wonderfully warm and soft. . . .
“Well, now that we are all digesting another magnificent feast, I beg a few
moments of your attention for the usual start-of-term notices,” said
Dumbledore. “First years ought to know that the forest in the grounds is outof bounds to students — and a few of our older students ought to know by
now too.” (Harry, Ron, and Hermione exchanged smirks.)
“Mr. Filch, the caretaker, has asked me, for what he tells me is the four
hundred and sixty-second time, to remind you all that magic is not permitted
in corridors between classes, nor are a number of other things, all of which
can be checked on the extensive list now fastened to Mr. Filch’s office door.
“We have had two changes in staffing this year. We are very pleased to
welcome back Professor Grubbly-Plank, who will be taking Care of Magical
Creatures lessons; we are He can tell I’ve been trying to
get him on his own again, and he’s not going to let it happen!”“Well, you’ve just got to keep at it, haven’t you?”
The short queue of people waiting to file past Filch, who was doing his
usual prodding act with the Secrecy Sensor, moved forward a few steps and
Harry did not answer in case he was overheard by the caretaker. He wished
Ron and Hermione both luck, then turned and climbed the marble staircase
again, determined, whatever Hermione said, to devote an hour or two to the
Room of Requirement.
Once out of sight of the entrance hall, Harry pulled the Marauder’s Map
and his Invisibility Cloak from his bag. Having concealed himself, he tapped
the map, murmured, 
“I solemnly swear that I am up to no good,”
 and scanned
it carefully.
As it was Sunday morning, nearly all the students were inside their various
common rooms, the Gryffindors in one tower, the Ravenclaws in another, the
Slytherins in the dungeons, and the Hufflepuffs in the basement near the
kitchens. Here and there werewolf Remus Lupin, half-giant Rubeus Hagrid, and delusional
ex-Auror ‘Mad-Eye’ Moody.
“Rumors abound, of course, that Albus Dumbledore, once Supreme
Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards and Chief Warlock
of the Wizengamot, is no longer up to the task of managing the prestigious
school of Hogwarts.
“‘I think the appointment of the Inquisitor is a first step toward ensuring
that Hogwarts has a headmaster in whom we can all repose confidence,’ said
a Ministry insider last night.
“Wizengamot elders Griselda Marchbanks and Tiberius Ogden have
resigned in protest at the introduction of the post of Inquisitor to Hogwarts.
“‘Hogwarts is a school, not an outpost of Cornelius Fudge’s office,’ said
Madam Marchbanks. ‘This is a further disgusting attempt to discredit Albus
Dumbledore.’ (For a full account of Madam Marchbanks’ alleged links to
subversive goblin groups, turn to page 17.)”
Hermione finished reading and looked across the table at the other two.
“So now we know how we ended up with Umbridg Quidditch
practices twice a week, Ron also had prefect duties. However, Hermione, who
was taking more subjects than either of them, had not only finished all her
homework but was also finding time to knit more elf clothes. Harry had to
admit that she was getting better; it was now almost always possible to
distinguish between the hats and the socks.
The morning of the Hogsmeade visit dawned bright but windy. Afterbreakfast they queued up in front of Filch, who matched their names to the
long list of students who had permission from their parents or guardian to
visit the village. With a slight pang, Harry remembered that if it hadn’t been
for Sirius, he would not have been going at all.
When Harry reached Filch, the caretaker gave a great sniff as though trying
to detect a whiff of something from Harry. Then he gave a curt nod that set
his jowls aquiver again and Harry walked on, out onto the stone steps and the
cold, sunlit day.
“Er — why was Filch sniffing you?” asked Ron, as he, Harry, and
Hermione set off "
What does the Mirror of Erised show?,The deepest desire of one's heart,"According to the text, the Mirror of Erised shows the deepest, most desperate desire of one's heart. It shows the viewer what they most desire or want, whether it's a happy memory, a loved one, or a sense of achievement.","ized by now what it does?”
“It — well — it shows me my family —”
“And it showed your friend Ron himself as Head Boy.”
“How did you know — ?”
“I don’t need a cloak to become invisible,” said Dumbledore gently. “Now,
can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?”
Harry shook his head.
“Let me explain. The happiest man on earth would be able to use the
Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it and see
himself exactly as he is. Does that help?”
Harry thought. Then he said slowly, “It shows us what we want . . .
whatever we want . . .”
“Yes and no,” said Dumbledore quietly. “It shows us nothing more or less
than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts. You, who have never
known your family, see them standing around you. Ronald Weasley, who has
always been overshadowed by his brothers, sees himself standing alone, the
best of all of them. However, this mirror will give us neither knowledge or
truth. Men have wasted away before it, entranced by what they have seen, or
bee , pulled it out from underneath his trainers, and examined it.
He realized what it was within seconds. Sirius had given it to him just
inside the front door of twelve Grimmauld Place. 
Use it if you need me, all
right?
Harry sank down onto his bed and unwrapped the package. Out fell a small,square mirror. It looked old; it was certainly dirty. Harry held it up to his face
and saw his own reflection looking back at him.
He turned the mirror over. There on the reverse side was a scribbled note
from Sirius.
This is a two-way mirror. I’ve got the other. If you need to speak to me,
just say my name into it; you’ll appear in my mirror and I’ll be able to
talk in yours. James and I used to use them when we were in separate
detentions.
And Harry’s heart began to race. He remembered seeing his dead parents in
the Mirror of Erised four years ago. He was going to be able to talk to Sirius
again, right now, he knew it —
He looked around to make sure there was nobody else there; the dormitory
was quite empty. He looked ba  knew you’d seen me coming to look at what was guarding
the Stone.”
“
You
 let the troll in?”
“Certainly. I have a special gift with trolls — you must have seen what I
did to the one in the chamber back there? Unfortunately, while everyone else
was running around looking for it, Snape, who already suspected me, went
straight to the third floor to head me off — and not only did my troll fail to
beat you to death, that three-headed dog didn’t even manage to bite Snape’s
leg off properly.
“Now, wait quietly, Potter. I need to examine this interesting mirror.”
It was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell. It
was the Mirror of Erised.
“This mirror is the key to finding the Stone,” Quirrell murmured, tapping
his way around the frame. “Trust Dumbledore to come up with something like
this . . . but he’s in London . . . I’ll be far away by the time he gets back. . . .”
All Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and stop him
from concentrating on the mirror.
“I saw you and Sna ck at the mirror, raised it in front of his face
with trembling hands, and said, loudly and clearly, “Sirius.”
His breath misted the surface of the glass. He held the mirror even closer,
excitement flooding through him, but the eyes blinking back at him through
the fog were definitely his own.
He wiped the mirror clear again and said, so that every syllable rang clearly
through the room, “Sirius Black!”
Nothing happened. The frustrated face looking back out of the mirror was
still, definitely, his own. . . .
Sirius didn’t have his mirror on him when he went through the archway,
said a small voice in Harry’s head.
 That’s why it’s not working. . . .
Harry remained quite still for a moment, then hurled the mirror back into
the trunk where it shattered. He had been convinced, for a whole, shining
minute, that he was going to see Sirius, talk to him again. . . .
Disappointment was burning in his throat. He got up and began throwing
his things pell-mell into the trunk on top of the broken mirror 
—
But then an ide e. He was walking
so fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise, but he didn’t meet
anyone.
And there were his mother and father smiling at him again, and one of his
grandfathers nodding happily. Harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of
the mirror. There was nothing to stop him from staying here all night with his
family. Nothing at all.
Except —
“So — back again, Harry?”
Harry felt as though his insides had turned to ice. He looked behind him.
Sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than Albus
Dumbledore. Harry must have walked straight past him, so desperate to get to
the mirror he hadn’t noticed him.“I — I didn’t see you, sir.”
“Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you,” said Dumbledore,
and Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling.
“So,” said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with Harry,
“you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of
Erised.”
“I didn’t know it was called that, sir.”
“But I expect you’ve real 
 
CHAPTER  THIRTEEN
NICOLAS FLAMEL
umbledore had convinced Harry not to go looking for the Mirror of
Erised again, and for the rest of the Christmas holidays the Invisibility
Cloak stayed folded at the bottom of his trunk. Harry wished he could forget
what he’d seen in the mirror as easily, but he couldn’t. He started having
nightmares. Over and over again he dreamed about his parents disappearing
in a flash of green light, while a high voice cackled with laughter.
“You see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could drive you mad,” said
Ron, when Harry told him about these dreams.
Hermione, who came back the day before term started, took a different
view of things. She was torn between horror at the idea of Harry being out of
bed, roaming the school three nights in a row (“If Filch had caught you!”),
and disappointment that he hadn’t at least found out who Nicolas Flamel was.
They had almost given up hope of ever finding Flamel in a library book,
even though Harry was still sure he’d read the name somewhere. O side
 the mirror? Should I break it?”
Harry’s mind was racing.What I want more than anything else in the world at the moment,
 he
thought
, is to find the Stone before Quirrell does. So if I look in the mirror, I
should see myself finding it — which means I’ll see where it’s hidden! But
how can I look without Quirrell realizing what I’m up to?
He tried to edge to the left, to get in front of the glass without Quirrell
noticing, but the ropes around his ankles were too tight: he tripped and fell
over. Quirrell ignored him. He was still talking to himself.
“What does this mirror do? How does it work? Help me, Master!”
And to Harry’s horror, a voice answered, and the voice seemed to come
from Quirrell himself.
“Use the boy . . . Use the boy . . .”
Quirrell rounded on Harry.
“Yes — Potter — come here.”
He clapped his hands once, and the ropes binding Harry fell off. Harry got
slowly to his feet.
“Come here,” Quirrell repeated. “Look in the mirror and tell me what you
see.”
Harry walked toward him.
I must lie,
 he more furiously than when the
book had screamed — for he had seen not only himself in the mirror, but a
whole crowd of people standing right behind him.
But the room was empty. Breathing very fast, he turned slowly back to the
mirror.
There he was, reflected in it, white and scared-looking, and there, reflected
behind him, were at least ten others. Harry looked over his shoulder — but
still, no one was there. Or were they all invisible, too? Was he in fact in a
room full of invisible people and this mirror’s trick was that it reflected them,invisible or not?
He looked in the mirror again. A woman standing right behind his
reflection was smiling at him and waving. He reached out a hand and felt the
air behind him. If she was really there, he’d touch her, their reflections were
so close together, but he felt only air — she and the others existed only in the
mirror.
She was a very pretty woman. She had dark red hair and her eyes — 
her
eyes are just like mine,
 Harry thought, edging a little closer to the glass.
"
What plant screams when uprooted?,Mandrake,The plant that screams when uprooted is Devil's Snare.," stopped. There was a loud bark from the dog, but
Hermione had already jumped. She landed on Harry’s other side.
“We must be miles under the school,” she said.
“Lucky this plant thing’s here, really,” said Ron.
“Lucky!”
 shrieked Hermione. “Look at you both!”
She leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. She had to struggle
because the moment she had landed, the plant had started to twist snakelike
tendrils around her ankles. As for Harry and Ron, their legs had already been
bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing.
Hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on
her. Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off
them, but the more they strained against it, the tighter and faster the plant
wound around them.
“Stop moving!” Hermione ordered them. “I know what this is — it’s
Devil’s Snare!”
“Oh, I’m so glad we know what it’s called, that’s a great help,” snarled
Ron, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck.
“Shut up, I’m , who had been injured in a workplace accident some
weeks prior to his death.
Healer Miriam Strout, who was in charge of Mr. Bode’s ward at the
time of the incident, has been suspended on full pay and was unavailable
for comment yesterday, but a spokeswizard for the hospital said in a
statement, “St. Mungo’s deeply regrets the death of Mr. Bode, whose
health was improving steadily prior to this tragic accident.
“We have strict guidelines on the decorations permitted on our wards
but it appears that Healer Strout, busy over the Christmas period,
overlooked the dangers of the plant on Mr. Bode’s bedside table. As his
speech and mobility improved, Healer Strout encouraged Mr. Bode to
look after the plant himself, unaware that it was not an innocent
Flitterbloom, but a cutting of Devil’s Snare, which, when touched by the
convalescent Mr. Bode, throttled him instantly.
“St. Mungo’s is as yet unable to account for the presence of the plant
on the ward and asks any witch or wizard with information to come
forward.”
 ay, it fell back into its
deep sleep.
Harry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor. There was no
sign of the bottom.
He lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his
fingertips. Then he looked up at Ron and said, “If anything happens to me,
don’t follow. Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore,
right?”
“Right,” said Ron.
“See you in a minute, I hope. . . .”
And Harry let go. Cold, damp air rushed past him as he fell down, down,
down and —
FLUMP. With a funny, muffled sort of thump he landed on something soft.
He sat up and felt around, his eyes not used to the gloom. It felt as though he
was sitting on some sort of plant.
“It’s okay!” he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp, which was
the open trapdoor, “it’s a soft landing, you can jump!”
Ron followed right away. He landed, sprawled next to Harry.
“What’s this stuff?” were his first words.“Dunno, some sort of plant thing. I suppose it’s here to break the fall. Come
on, Hermione!”
The distant music stared at the thing. It was pulsating slightly, giving it the rather
sinister look of some diseased internal organ.
“It’s really, really rare,” said Neville, beaming. “I don’t know if there’s one
in the greenhouse at Hogwarts, even. I can’t wait to show it to Professor
Sprout. My great-uncle Algie got it for me in Assyria. I’m going to see if I
can breed from it.”
Harry knew that Neville’s favorite subject was Herbology, but for the life
of him he could not see what he would want with this stunted little plant.
“Does it — er — do anything?” he asked.
“Loads of stuff!” said Neville proudly. “It’s got an amazing defensive
mechanism — hold Trevor for me . . .”He dumped the toad into Harry’s lap and took a quill from his schoolbag.
Luna Lovegood’s popping eyes appeared over the top of her upside-down
magazine again, watching what Neville was doing. Neville held the 
Mimbulus
mimbletonia
 up to his eyes, his tongue between his teeth, chose his spot, and
gave the plant a sharp prod with the tip of his quill.
Liquid op of his lungs.
Professor Sprout took a large plant pot from under the table and plunged
the Mandrake into it, burying him in dark, damp compost until only the tufted
leaves were visible. Professor Sprout dusted off her hands, gave them all the
thumbs-up, and removed her own earmuffs.
“As our Mandrakes are only seedlings, their cries won’t kill yet,” she said
calmly as though she’d just done nothing more exciting than water a begonia.
“However, they 
will
 knock you out for several hours, and as I’m sure none of
you want to miss your first day back, make sure your earmuffs are securely in
place while you work. I will attract your attention when it is time to pack up.
“Four to a tray — there is a large supply of pots here — compost in the
sacks over there — and be careful of the Venomous Tentacula, it’s teething.”
She gave a sharp slap to a spiky, dark red plant as she spoke, making it
draw in the long feelers that had been inching sneakily over her shoulder.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione were joined at their tray  visiting tonight, so that’s nice, isn’t
it?”
Agnes gave several loud barks.
“And look, Broderick, you’ve been sent a potted plant and a lovely
calendar with a different fancy hippogriff for each month, they’ll brighten
things up, won’t they?” said the Healer, bustling along to the mumbling man,
setting a rather ugly plant with long, swaying tentacles on the bedside cabinet
and fixing the calendar to the wall with her wand. “And — oh, Mrs.
Longbottom, are you leaving already?”
Harry’s head spun round. The curtains had been drawn back from the two
beds at the end of the ward and two visitors were walking back down the aisle
between the beds: a formidable-looking old witch wearing a long green dress,
a moth-eaten fox fur, and a pointed hat decorated with what was unmistakably
a stuffed vulture and, trailing behind her looking thoroughly depressed —
Neville.
With a sudden rush of understanding, Harry realized who the people in the
end beds must be. He cast around wildly for some means of distracting the
others s silent forest. Birds in the
treetops overhead rose twittering from their perches and soared away. In front
of Harry and Hermione, meanwhile, the gigantic Grawp was rising from the
ground, which shuddered as he placed an enormous hand upon it to push
himself onto his knees and turned his head to see who and what had disturbedhim.
“All righ’, Grawpy?” said Hagrid in a would-be cheery voice, backing
away with the long bough raised, ready to poke Grawp again. “Had a nice
sleep, eh?”
Harry and Hermione retreated as far as they could while still keeping the
giant within their sights. Grawp knelt between two trees he had not yet
uprooted. They looked up into his startlingly huge face, which resembled a
gray full moon swimming in the gloom of the clearing. It was as though the
features had been hewn onto a great stone ball. The nose was stubby and
shapeless, the mouth lopsided and full of misshapen yellow teeth the size of
half-bricks. The small eyes were a muddy greenish-brown and just now were
half gummed together  “Bode . . .” said Ron. “
Bode. 
It rings a bell . . .”
“We saw him,” Hermione whispered. “In St. Mungo’s, remember? He was
in the bed opposite Lockhart’s, just lying there, staring at the ceiling. And we
saw the Devil’s Snare arrive. She — the Healer — said it was a Christmas
present . . .”
Harry looked back at the story. A feeling of horror was rising like bile in
his throat.“How come we didn’t recognize Devil’s Snare . . . ? We’ve seen it
before . . . we could’ve stopped this from happening . . .”
“Who expects Devil’s Snare to turn up in a hospital disguised as a potted
plant?” said Ron sharply. “It’s not our fault, whoever sent it to the bloke is to
blame! They must be a real prat, why didn’t they check what they were
buying?”
“Oh come on, Ron!” said Hermione shakily, “I don’t think anyone could
put Devil’s Snare in a pot and not realize it tries to kill whoever touches it?
This — this was murder. . . . A clever murder, as well. . . . If the plant was
sent anonymously, how’s anyone ever going to find out w"

began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat: a copper kettle,
a squashy package of sausages, a poker, a teapot, several chipped mugs, and a
bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from before starting to make
tea. Soon the hut was full of the sound and smell of sizzling sausage. Nobody
said a thing while the giant was working, but as he slid the first six fat, juicy,
slightly burnt sausages from the poker, Dudley fidgeted a little. Uncle Vernon
said sharply, “Don’t touch anything he gives you, Dudley.”
The giant chuckled darkly.
“Yer great puddin’ of a son don’ need fattenin’ anymore, Dursley, don’
worry.”
He passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry he had never tasted
anything so wonderful, but he still couldn’t take his eyes off the giant. Finally,
as nobody seemed about to explain anything, he said, “I’m sorry, but I still
don’t really know who you are.”
The giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand.
“Call me Hagrid,” he  aked and ran to hide behind his mother, who was crouching,
terrified, behind Uncle Vernon.
“An’ here’s Harry!” said the giant.
Harry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face and saw that the beetle
eyes were crinkled in a smile.
“Las’ time I saw you, you was only a baby,” said the giant. “Yeh look a lot
like yer dad, but yeh’ve got yer mum’s eyes.”
Uncle Vernon made a funny rasping noise.
“I demand that you leave at once, sir!” he said. “You are breaking and
entering!”
“Ah, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune,” said the giant; he reached over the
back of the sofa, jerked the gun out of Uncle Vernon’s hands, bent it into a
knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber, and threw it into a corner of
the room.
Uncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a mouse being trodden on.
“Anyway — Harry,” said the giant, turning his back on the Dursleys, “a
very happy birthday to yeh. Got summat fer yeh here — I mighta sat on it at
some point, but it’ll taste all right.”
From an inside pocket of his black overcoat h e pulled a slightly squashed
box. Harry opened it with trembling fingers. Inside was a large, sticky
chocolate cake with 
Happy Birthday Harry
 written on it in green icing.
Harry looked up at the giant. He meant to say thank you, but the words got
lost on the way to his mouth, and what he said instead was, “Who are you?”
The giant chuckled.
“True, I haven’t introduced meself. Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and
Grounds at Hogwarts.”He held out an enormous hand and shook Harry’s whole arm.
“What about that tea then, eh?” he said, rubbing his hands together. “I’d not
say no ter summat stronger if yeh’ve got it, mind.”
His eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags in it and he
snorted. He bent down over the fireplace; they couldn’t see what he was
doing but when he drew back a second later, there was a roaring fire there. It
filled the whole damp hut with flickering light and Harry felt the warmth
wash over him as though he’d sunk into a hot bath.
The giant sat back down on the sofa, which sagged  he spells bounced off him?”
“It’ll be his giant blood,” said Hermione shakily. “It’s very hard to Stun a
giant, they’re like trolls, really tough. . . . But poor Professor McGonagall. . . .
Four Stunners straight in the chest, and she’s not exactly young, is she?”
“Dreadful, dreadful,” said Ernie, shaking his head pompously. “Well, I’m
off to bed . . . ’Night, all . . .”
People around them were drifting away, still talking excitedly about what
they had just seen.
“At least they didn’t get to take Hagrid off to Azkaban,” said Ron. “I ’spect
he’s gone to join Dumbledore, hasn’t he?”
“I suppose so,” said Hermione, who looked tearful. “Oh, this is awful, I
really thought Dumbledore would be back before long, but now we’ve lost
Hagrid too . . .”
They traipsed back to the Gryffindor common room to find it full. The
commotion out in the grounds had woken several people, who had hastened to
rouse their friends. Seamus and Dean, who had arrived ahead of Harry, Ron,
and Hermione, were now telling everyone what they had eyes streaming as he
mopped his face with his apron. “It’s . . . Aragog. . . . I think he’s dyin’. . . .
He got ill over the summer an’ he’s not gettin’ better. . . . I don’ know what I’ll
do if he . . . if he . . . We’ve bin tergether so long. . . .”
Hermione patted Hagrid’s shoulder, looking at a complete loss for anything
to say. Harry knew how she felt. He had known Hagrid to present a vicious
baby dragon with a teddy bear, seen him croon over giant scorpions with
suckers and stingers, attempt to reason with his brutal giant of a half-brother,
but this was perhaps the most incomprehensible of all his monster fancies: the
gigantic talking spider, Aragog, who dwelled deep in the Forbidden Forest
and which he and Ron had only narrowly escaped four years previously.
“Is there — is there anything we can do?” Hermione asked, ignoring Ron’s
frantic grimaces and head-shakings.
“I don’ think there is, Hermione,” choked Hagrid, attempting to stem the
flood of his tears. “See, the rest o’ the tribe . . . Aragog’s fa prooted, roofs ripped off, lampposts bent, horrible injuries —”
“It was the Death Eaters,” said Fudge. “He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named’s
followers. And . . . and we suspect giant involvement.”
The Prime Minister stopped in his tracks as though he had hit an invisible
wall. “
What
 involvement?”
Fudge grimaced. “He used giants last time, when he wanted to go for the
grand effect,” he said. “The Office of Misinformation has been working
around the clock, we’ve had teams of Obliviators out trying to modify the
memories of all the Muggles who saw what really happened, we’ve got most
of the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures
running around Somerset, but we can’t find the giant — it’s been a disaster.”
“You don’t say!” said the Prime Minister furiously.
“I won’t deny that morale is pretty low at the Ministry,” said Fudge. “What
with all that, and then losing Amelia Bones.”
“Losing who?”
“Amelia Bones. Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. We
think He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named may have  doorway.
“Oh my — !” shrieked Hermione, as she and Ron caught up with Harry and
gazed upward at the giant now trying to seize people through the window
above.
“DON’T!” Ron yelled, grabbing Hermione’s hand as she raised her wand.
“Stun him and he’ll crush half the castle —”
“HAGGER?”
Grawp came lurching around the corner of the castle; only now did Harry
realize that Grawp was, indeed, an undersized giant. The gargantuan monster
trying to crush people on the upper floors looked around and let out a roar.
The stone steps trembled as he stomped toward his smaller kin, and Grawp’s
lopsided mouth fell open, showing yellow, half-brick-sized teeth; and then
they launched themselves at each other with the savagery of lions.
“RUN!” Harry roared; the night was full of hideous yells and blows as the
giants wrestled, and he seized Hermione’s hand and tore down the steps into
the grounds, Ron bringing up the rear. Harry had not lost hope of finding and
saving Hagrid; he ran so fast that they were halfway toward the fores ked anyone, have you?” said Ron. “You and Cho
just —”
“Sort of fell apart, yeah,” said Harry.
“Wish that would happen with me and Lavender,” said Ron gloomily,
watching Hermione silently tapping each of his misspelled words with the end
of her wand, so that they corrected themselves on the page. “But the more I
hint I want to finish it, the tighter she holds on. It’s like going out with the
giant squid.”
“There,” said Hermione, some twenty minutes later, handing back Ron’s
essay.“Thanks a million,” said Ron. “Can I borrow your quill for the
conclusion?”
Harry, who had found nothing useful in the Half-Blood Prince’s notes so
far, looked around; the three of them were now the only ones left in the
common room, Seamus having just gone up to bed cursing Snape and his
essay. The only sounds were the crackling of the fire and Ron scratching out
one last paragraph on dementors using Hermione’s quill. Harry had just
closed the Half-Blood Prince’s book, yawning, when —
Crack.
Hermione let out a little shriek; Ron spil"

The witch with the monocle on Fudge’s left cut across him in a booming
voice.
“You produced a fully fledged Patronus?”
“Yes,” said Harry, “because —”
“A corporeal Patronus?”
“A — what?” said Harry.“Your Patronus had a clearly defined form? I mean to say, it was more than
vapor or smoke?”
“Yes,” said Harry, feeling both impatient and slightly desperate, “it’s a stag,
it’s always a stag.”
“Always?” boomed Madam Bones. “You have produced a Patronus before
now?”
“Yes,”
 said Harry, “I’ve been doing it for over a year —”
“And you are fifteen years old?”
“Yes, and —”
“You learned this at school?”
“Yes, Professor Lupin taught me in my third year, because of the —”
“Impressive,” said Madam Bones, staring down at him, “a true Patronus at
that age . . . very impressive indeed.”
Some of the wizards and witches around her were muttering again; a few
nodded, but others were frowning and shaking their heads.
“It’s not a question of how impressive the magic was,” sai lf, guilty about his secret desire to
hear his parents’ voices again.
“You’re expecting too much of yourself,” said Professor Lupin sternly in
their fourth week of practice. “For a thirteen-year-old wizard, even an
indistinct Patronus is a huge achievement. You aren’t passing out anymore,
are you?”
“I thought a Patronus would — charge the dementors down or something,”
said Harry dispiritedly. “Make them disappear —”“The true Patronus does do that,” said Lupin. “But you’ve achieved a great
deal in a very short space of time. If the dementors put in an appearance at
your next Quidditch match, you will be able to keep them at bay long enough
to get back to the ground.”
“You said it’s harder if there are loads of them,” said Harry.
“I have complete confidence in you,” said Lupin, smiling. “Here — you’ve
earned a drink — something from the Three Broomsticks. You won’t have
tried it before —”
He pulled two bottles out of his briefcase.
“Butterbeer!” said Harry, without thinking. “Yeah, I like that stuff!”
Lupin rai ctly, it conjures up a Patronus,” said Lupin,
“which is a kind of anti-dementor — a guardian that acts as a shield between
you and the dementor.”
Harry had a sudden vision of himself crouching behind a Hagrid-sized
figure holding a large club. Professor Lupin continued, “The Patronus is a
kind of positive force, a projection of the very things that the dementor feeds
upon — hope, happiness, the desire to survive — but it cannot feel despair, as
real humans can, so the dementors can’t hurt it. But I must warn you, Harry,
that the charm might be too advanced for you. Many qualified wizards have
difficulty with it.”
“What does a Patronus look like?” said Harry curiously.
“Each one is unique to the wizard who conjures it.”
“And how do you conjure it?”“With an incantation, which will work only if you are concentrating, with
all your might, on a single, very happy memory.”
Harry cast his mind about for a happy memory. Certainly, nothing that had
happened to him at the Dursleys’ was going to do. Finally, he settled  rl with the long plait down her back, looking
at Harry, “that you can produce a Patronus?”
There was a murmur of interest around the group at this.
“Yeah,” said Harry slightly defensively.
“A corporeal Patronus?”
The phrase stirred something in Harry’s memory.
“Er — you don’t know Madam Bones, do you?” he asked.
The girl smiled.
“She’s my auntie,” she said. “I’m Susan Bones. She told me about your
hearing. So — is it really true? You make a stag Patronus?”
“Yes,” said Harry.
“Blimey, Harry!” said Lee, looking deeply impressed. “I never knew that!”
“Mum told Ron not to spread it around,” said Fred, grinning at Harry. “She
said you got enough attention as it was.”
“She’s not wrong,” mumbled Harry and a couple of people laughed. The
veiled witch sitting alone shifted very slightly in her seat.
“And did you kill a basilisk with that sword in Dumbledore’s office?”
demanded Terry Boot. “That’s what one of the portraits on the wall told me
when I was in there last year . . .”
“Er — yeah, I did, yeah,” said Harry.
Ju rmione, pretending to examine the old
tapestry of the Black family tree on the wall. Then Hermione shrieked: Harry
drew his wand again and spun around to see a silver Patronus soar through the
drawing room window and land upon the floor in front of them, where it
solidified into the weasel that spoke with the voice of Ron’s father.
“Family safe, do not reply, we are being watched.”
The Patronus dissolved into nothingness. Ron let out a noise between a
whimper and a groan and dropped onto the sofa: Hermione joined him,
gripping his arm.
“They’re all right, they’re all right!” she whispered, and Ron half laughed
and hugged her.
“Harry,” he said over Hermione’s shoulder, “I —”
“It’s not a problem,” said Harry, sickened by the pain in his head. “It’s your
family, ’course you’re worried. I’d feel the same way.” He thought of Ginny.
“I 
do
 feel the same way.”
The pain in his scar was reaching a peak, burning as it had done in thegarden of the Burrow. Faintly he heard Hermione say, “I don’t want to be on
my own. Co hook his head.
“It was stupid, thinking it was him,” he muttered. “I mean, I knew he was
dead.”
“You think the dead we have loved ever truly leave us? You think that we
don’t recall them more clearly than ever in times of great trouble? Your father
is alive in you, Harry, and shows himself most plainly when you have need of
him. How else could you produce that 
particular
 Patronus? Prongs rode again
last night.”It took a moment for Harry to realize what Dumbledore had said.
“Last night Sirius told me all about how they became Animagi,” said
Dumbledore, smiling. “An extraordinary achievement — not least, keeping it
quiet from me. And then I remembered the most unusual form your Patronus
took, when it charged Mr. Malfoy down at your Quidditch match against
Ravenclaw. So you did see your father last night, Harry. . . . You found him
inside yourself.”
And Dumbledore left the office, leaving Harry to his very confused
thoughts.
Nobody at Hogwarts knew the truth of what had happened the night that
Sirius, Buckbeak y something like a
dementor.
“Oh, don’t be such a killjoy,” said Cho brightly, watching her silvery swan-
shaped Patronus soar around the Room of Requirement during their last
lesson before Easter. “They’re so pretty!”
“They’re not supposed to be pretty, they’re supposed to protect you,” said
Harry patiently. “What we really need is a boggart or something; that’s how I
learned, I had to conjure a Patronus while the boggart was pretending to be a
dementor —”
“But that would be really scary!” said Lavender, who was shooting puffs of
silver vapor out of the end of her wand. “And I still — can’t — do it!” she
added angrily.
Neville was having trouble too. His face was screwed up in concentration,
but only feeble wisps of silver smoke issued from his wand-tip.
“You’ve got to think of something happy,” Harry reminded him.
“I’m trying,” said Neville miserably, who was trying so hard his round face
was actually shining with sweat.
“Harry, I think I’m doing it!” yelled Seamus, who had been brought along
to his first e nge killed him.”
The barman’s face was impassive. After a few moments he said, “I’m sorry
to hear it. I liked that elf.”
He turned away, lighting lamps with prods of his wand, not looking at any
of them.“You’re Aberforth,” said Harry to the man’s back.
He neither confirmed nor denied it, but bent to light the fire.
“How did you get this?” Harry asked, walking across to Sirius’s mirror, the
twin of the one he had broken nearly two years before.
“Bought it from Dung ’bout a year ago,” said Aberforth. “Albus told me
what it was. Been trying to keep an eye out for you.”
Ron gasped.
“The silver doe!” he said excitedly. “Was that you too?”
“What are you talking about?” said Aberforth.
“Someone sent a doe Patronus to us!”
“Brains like that, you could be a Death Eater, son. Haven’t I just proved my
Patronus is a goat?”
“Oh,” said Ron. “Yeah . . . well, I’m hungry!” he added defensively as his
stomach gave an enormous rumble.
“I got food,” said Aberforth, and he sloped out of the room, reappearing
moments later with a"

The witch with the monocle on Fudge’s left cut across him in a booming
voice.
“You produced a fully fledged Patronus?”
“Yes,” said Harry, “because —”
“A corporeal Patronus?”
“A — what?” said Harry.“Your Patronus had a clearly defined form? I mean to say, it was more than
vapor or smoke?”
“Yes,” said Harry, feeling both impatient and slightly desperate, “it’s a stag,
it’s always a stag.”
“Always?” boomed Madam Bones. “You have produced a Patronus before
now?”
“Yes,”
 said Harry, “I’ve been doing it for over a year —”
“And you are fifteen years old?”
“Yes, and —”
“You learned this at school?”
“Yes, Professor Lupin taught me in my third year, because of the —”
“Impressive,” said Madam Bones, staring down at him, “a true Patronus at
that age . . . very impressive indeed.”
Some of the wizards and witches around her were muttering again; a few
nodded, but others were frowning and shaking their heads.
“It’s not a question of how impressive the magic was,” sai lf, guilty about his secret desire to
hear his parents’ voices again.
“You’re expecting too much of yourself,” said Professor Lupin sternly in
their fourth week of practice. “For a thirteen-year-old wizard, even an

And Dumbledore left the office, leaving Harry to his very confused
thoughts.
Nobody at Hogwarts knew the truth of what had happened the night that
Sirius, Buckbeak single gold hoop in his
ear. “He looks exactly like James.”
“Except the eyes,” said a wheezy-voiced, silver-haired wizard at the back.
“Lily’s eyes.”
Mad-Eye Moody, who had long grizzled gray hair and a large chunk
missing from his nose, was squinting suspiciously at Harry through his
mismatched eyes. One of the eyes was small, dark, and beady, the other large,
round, and electric blue — the magical eye that could see through walls,
doors, and the back of Moody’s own head.
“Are you quite sure it’s him, Lupin?” he growled. “It’d be a nice lookout if
we bring back some Death Eater impersonating him. We ought to ask him
something only the real Potter would know. Unless anyone brought any
Veritaserum?”
“Harry, what form does your Patronus take?” said Lupin.
“A stag,” said Harry nervously.
“That’s him, Mad-Eye,” said Lupin.
Harry descended the stairs, very conscious of everybody still staring at him,stowing his wand into the back pocket of his jeans as he came.
“Don’t put your wand there, boy!” roared Moody. “What Remus?”
“No, I haven’t been in contact with anybody very much,” said Lupin. “But
Tonks has got her own family to go to, hasn’t she?”
“Hmmm,” said Mrs. Weasley. “Maybe. I got the impression she was
planning to spend Christmas alone, actually.”
She gave Lupin an annoyed look, as though it was all his fault she was
getting Fleur for a daughter-in-law instead of Tonks, but Harry, glancing
across at Fleur, who was now feeding Bill bits of turkey off her own fork,
thought that Mrs. Weasley was fighting a long-lost battle. He was, however,
reminded of a question he had with regard to Tonks, and who better to ask
than Lupin, the man who knew all about Patronuses?
“Tonks’s Patronus has changed its form,” he told him. “Snape said so
anyway. I didn’t know that could happen. Why would your Patronus change?”
Lupin took his time chewing his turkey and swallowing before saying
slowly, “Sometimes . . . a great shock . . . an emotional upheaval . . .”
“It looked big, and it had four legs,” said Harry, struck by a sudden thoug ar is enclosed.
Yours sincerely,
Deputy Headmistress
Harry pulled out the Hogsmeade permission form and looked at it, no
longer grinning. It would be wonderful to visit Hogsmeade on weekends; he
knew it was an entirely wizarding village, and he had never set foot there. But
how on earth was he going to persuade Uncle Vernon or Aunt Petunia to sign
the form?
He looked over at the alarm clock. It was now two o’clock in the morning.
Deciding that he’d worry about the Hogsmeade form when he woke up,
Harry got back into bed and reached up to cross off another day on the chart
he’d made for himself, counting down the days left until his return to
Hogwarts. Then he took off his glasses and lay down, eyes open, facing his
three birthday cards.
Extremely unusual though he was, at that moment Harry Potter felt just like
everyone else — glad, for the first time in his life, that it was his birthday.H

AUNT MARGE’S BIG MISTAKE

the exit from the other doors than located an ant upon the jet-black floor.
Meanwhile, the door through which they needed to proceed could be any of
the dozen surrounding them.
“How’re we going to get back out?” said Neville uncomfortably.“Well, that doesn’t matter now,” said Harry forcefully, blinking to try and
erase the blue lines from his vision, and clutching his wand tighter than ever.
“We won’t need to get out till we’ve found Sirius —”
“Don’t go calling for him, though!” Hermione said urgently, but Harry had
never needed her advice less; his instinct was to keep as quiet as possible for
the time being.
“Where do we go, then, Harry?” Ron asked.
“I don’t —” Harry began. He swallowed. “In the dreams I went through the
door at the end of the corridor from the lifts into a dark room — that’s this
one — and then I went through another door into a room that kind of . . .
glitters. We should try a few doors,” he said hastily. “I’ll know the right  amusing was
Hermione, who maintained a rigidly disapproving expression throughout and
refused to talk at all if Harry had used the 
Muffliato
 spell on anyone in the
vicinity.
Sitting up in bed, Harry turned the book sideways so as to examine more
closely the scribbled instructions for a spell that seemed to have caused the
Prince some trouble. There were many crossings-out and alterations, but
finally, crammed into a corner of the page, the scribble:
Levicorpus (nvbl)
While the wind and sleet pounded relentlessly on the windows, and Neville
snored loudly, Harry stared at the letters in brackets. 
Nvbl . . . 
that had to
mean “nonverbal.” Harry rather doubted he would be able to bring off this
particular spell; he was still having difficulty with nonverbal spells,
something Snape had been quick to comment on in every D.A.D.A. class. On
the other hand, the Prince had proved a much more effective teacher than
Snape so far.
Pointing his wand at nothing in particular, he gave it an upward flick and
said 
Levicorp us,
you know. Charming girl. I used to tell her she ought to have been in my
House. Very cheeky answers I used to get back too.”
“Which was your House?”
“I was Head of Slytherin,” said Slughorn. “Oh, now,” he went on quickly,
seeing the expression on Harry’s face and wagging a stubby finger at him,
“don’t go holding that against me! You’ll be Gryffindor like her, I suppose?
Yes, it usually goes in families. Not always, though. Ever heard of Sirius
Black? You must have done — been in the papers for the last couple of years
— died a few weeks ago —”
It was as though an invisible hand had twisted Harry’s intestines and held
them tight.
“Well, anyway, he was a big pal of your father’s at school. The whole
Black family had been in my House, but Sirius ended up in Gryffindor!
Shame — he was a talented boy. I got his brother, Regulus, when he came
along, but I’d have liked the set.”
He sounded like an enthusiastic collector who had been outbid at auction.
Apparently lost in memories, he gazed at the opposite wall, t used for a moment, apparently to savor the pleasure of insultingHarry, before continuing, “Only Muggles talk of ‘mind reading.’ The mind is
not a book, to be opened at will and examined at leisure. Thoughts are not
etched on the inside of skulls, to be perused by any invader. The mind is a
complex and many-layered thing, Potter . . . or at least, most minds are . . .”
He smirked. “It is true, however, that those who have mastered Legilimency
are able, under certain conditions, to delve into the minds of their victims and
to interpret their findings correctly. The Dark Lord, for instance, almost
always knows when somebody is lying to him. Only those skilled at
Occlumency are able to shut down those feelings and memories that
contradict the lie, and so utter falsehoods in his presence without detection.”
Whatever Snape said, Legilimency sounded like mind reading to Harry and
he did not like the sound of it at all.
“So he could know what we’re thinking right now? Sir?”
“The Dark Lord is at a considerable distanc ntions. You know I
wouldn’t’ve used a spell like that, not even on Malfoy, but you can’t blame
the Prince, he hadn’t written ‘try this out, it’s really good’ — he was just
making notes for himself, wasn’t he, not for anyone else. . . .”
“Are you telling me,” said Hermione, “that you’re going to go back — ?”
“And get the book? Yeah, I am,” said Harry forcefully. “Listen, without the
Prince I’d never have won the Felix Felicis. I’d never have known how to
save Ron from poisoning, I’d never have —”
“— got a reputation for Potions brilliance you don’t deserve,” said
Hermione nastily.
“Give it a rest, Hermione!” said Ginny, and Harry was so amazed, so
grateful, he looked up. “By the sound of it, Malfoy was trying to use an
Unforgivable Curse, you should be glad Harry had something good up his
sleeve!”
“Well, of course I’m glad Harry wasn’t cursed!” said Hermione, clearly
stung. “But you can’t call that Sectumsempra spell good, Ginny, look where
it’s landed him! And I’d have thought, seeing what this has done to yo the ground with blank eyes staring at him . . .
“NOOOOOOO!”
He was on his knees again, his face buried in his hands, his brain aching as
though someone had been trying to pull it from his skull.
“Get up!” said Snape sharply. “Get up! You are not trying, you are making
no effort, you are allowing me access to memories you fear, handing meweapons!”
Harry stood up again, his heart thumping wildly as though he had really
just seen Cedric dead in the graveyard. Snape looked paler than usual, and
angrier, though not nearly as angry as Harry was.
“I — am — making — an — effort,” he said through clenched teeth.
“I told you to empty yourself of emotion!”
“Yeah? Well, I’m finding that hard at the moment,” Harry snarled.
“Then you will find yourself easy prey for the Dark Lord!” said Snape
savagely. “Fools who wear their hearts proudly on their sleeves, who cannot
control their emotions, who wallow in sad memories and allow themselves to
be provoked this easily — weak people, in other words — they stand no
chance agains l into it, and dropped a blot onto the first page
of the diary.
The ink shone brightly on the paper for a second and then, as though it was
being sucked into the page, vanished. Excited, Harry loaded up his quill a
second time and wrote, “My name is Harry Potter.”
The words shone momentarily on the page and they, too, sank without
trace. Then, at last, something happened.
Oozing back out of the page, in his very own ink, came words Harry had
never written.
“Hello, Harry Potter. My name is Tom Riddle. How did you come by my
diary?”
These words, too, faded away, but not before Harry had started to scribble
back.
“Someone tried to flush it down a toilet.”
He waited eagerly for Riddle’s reply.
“Lucky that I recorded my memories in some more lasting way than ink.
But I always knew that there would be those who would not want this diary
read.”
“What do you mean?” Harry scrawled, blotting the page in his excitement.
“I mean that this diary holds memories of terrible things. Things that were
covered up. Things that h ,” she added, as Harry and Ron rolled their eyes, “because I’m
starting to think this Prince character was a bit dodgy.”
Both Harry and Ron shouted her down at once.
“It was a laugh!” said Ron, upending a ketchup bottle over his sausages.
“Just a laugh, Hermione, that’s all!”
“Dangling people upside down by the ankle?” said Hermione. “Who puts
their time and energy into making up spells like that?”
“Fred and George,” said Ron, shrugging, “it’s their kind of thing. And, er
—”
“My dad,” said Harry. He had only just remembered.
“What?” said Ron and Hermione together.
“My dad used this spell,” said Harry. “I — Lupin told me.”
This last part was not true; in fact, Harry had seen his father use the spell
on Snape, but he had never told Ron and Hermione about that particular
excursion into the Pensieve. Now, however, a wonderful possibility occurred
to him. Could the Half-Blood Prince possibly be — ?
“Maybe your dad did use it, Harry,” said Hermione, “but he’s not the only
one. We’ve seen a whole bunch of people use"
Who is the head of Hufflepuff House?,Pomona Sprout,The head of Hufflepuff House is Pomona Sprout.,"cer in the Muggle world —
everyone follows Quidditch — played up in the air on broomsticks and
there’s four balls — sorta hard ter explain the rules.”
“And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?”
“School Houses. There’s four. Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o’
duffers, but —”
“I bet I’m in Hufflepuff,” said Harry gloomily.
“Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin,” said Hagrid darkly. “There’s not a
single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn’t in Slytherin. You-Know-
Who was one.”
“Vol-, sorry — You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?”
“Years an’ years ago,” said Hagrid.
They bought Harry’s school books in a shop called Flourish and Blotts
where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as paving
stones bound in leather; books the size of postage stamps in covers of silk;
books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with nothing in them at all.
Even Dudley, who never read anything, would have been wild to get his
hands on some of these. Hagrid almost had to drag Harry away from 
Curses
and Counter-curses  rom a doorway to the right — the
rest of the school must already be here — but Professor McGonagall showed
the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in,
standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering
about nervously.
“Welcome to Hogwarts,” said Professor McGonagall. “The start-of-term
banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall,
you will be sorted into your Houses. The Sorting is a very importantceremony because, while you are here, your House will be something like
your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your
House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free time in your House
common room.
“The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and
Slytherin. Each House has its own noble history and each has produced
outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs
will earn your House points, while any rule-breaking will lose House points.
At the end of the s glory; a feeling exacerbated, perhaps,
by the fact that Hufflepuff House very rarely got any glory, and that Cedric
was one of the few who had ever given them any, having beaten Gryffindor
once at Quidditch. Ernie Macmillan and Justin Finch-Fletchley, with whom
Harry normally got on very well, did not talk to him even though they were
repotting Bouncing Bulbs at the same tray — 
though they did laugh rather
unpleasantly when one of the Bouncing Bulbs wriggled free from Harry’s grip
and smacked him hard in the face. Ron wasn’t talking to Harry either.
Hermione sat between them, making very forced conversation, but though
both answered her normally, they avoided making eye contact with each
other. Harry thought even Professor Sprout seemed distant with him — 
but
then, she was Head of Hufflepuff House.
He would have been looking forward to seeing Hagrid under normal
circumstances, but Care of Magical Creatures meant seeing the Slytherins too
— 
the first time he would come face-to-face with them since becomin him most nights
with stupid dreams about the exams. He also suspected that part of his mind
— the part that often spoke in Hermione’s voice — now felt guilty on the
occasions it strayed down that corridor ending in the black door, and sought to
wake him before he could reach journey’s end.
“You know,” said Ron, whose ears were still flaming red, “if Montague
doesn’t recover before Slytherin play Hufflepuff, we might be in with a
chance of winning the Cup.”
“Yeah, I s’pose so,” said Harry, glad of a change of subject.
“I mean, we’ve won one, lost one — if Slytherin lose to Hufflepuff next
Saturday —”
“Yeah, that’s right,” said Harry, losing track of what he was agreeing to:
Cho Chang had just walked across the courtyard, determinedly not looking at
him.
The final match of the Quidditch season, Gryffindor versus Ravenclaw, was
to take place on the last weekend of May. Although Slytherin had been
narrowly defeated by Hufflepuff in their last match, Gryffindor was not
daring to hope for victory, due mainly (thoug “Diggory got the Snitch,” said George. “Just after you fell. He didn’t
realize what had happened. When he looked back and saw you on the ground,
he tried to call it off. Wanted a rematch. But they won fair and square . . .
even Wood admits it.”
“Where is Wood?” said Harry, suddenly realizing he wasn’t there.
“Still in the showers,” said Fred. “We think he’s trying to drown himself.”
Harry put his face to his knees, his hands gripping his hair. Fred grabbed
his shoulder and shook it roughly.
“C’mon, Harry, you’ve never missed the Snitch before.”
“There had to be one time you didn’t get it,” said George.
“It’s not over yet,” said Fred. “We lost by a hundred points, right? So if
Hufflepuff loses to Ravenclaw and we beat Ravenclaw and Slytherin . . .”
“Hufflepuff’ll have to lose by at least two hundred points,” said George.
“But if they beat Ravenclaw . . .”
“No way, Ravenclaw is too good. But if Slytherin loses against
Hufflepuff . . .”“It all depends on the points — a margin of a hundred either way —”
Harry lay nde hair, and swept
up between the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables.
“Oh look, they’re all disappointed,” Hermione said over the noise, nodding
toward the remainder of the Beauxbatons party. “Disappointed” was a bit of
an understatement, Harry thought. Two of the girls who had not been selected
had dissolved into tears and were sobbing with their heads on their arms.
When Fleur Delacour too had vanished into the side chamber, silence fell
again, but this time it was a silence so stiff with excitement you could almost
taste it. The Hogwarts champion next . . .
And the Goblet of Fire turned red once more; sparks showered out of it; the
tongue of flame shot high into the air, and from its tip Dumbledore pulled the
third piece of parchment.
“The Hogwarts champion,” he called, “is Cedric Diggory!”
“No!” said Ron loudly, but nobody heard him except Harry; the uproar
from the next table was too great. Every single Hufflepuff had jumped to his
or her feet, screaming and stamping, as Cedric made his way past them,
grin een the one for him.
Professor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of
parchment.
“When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be
sorted,” she said. “Abbott, Hannah!”
A pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line, put on the hat,
which fell right down over her eyes, and sat down. A moment’s pause —
“HUFFLEPUFF!” shouted the hat.
The table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at
the Hufflepuff table. Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving merrily at
her.
“Bones, Susan!”
“HUFFLEPUFF!” shouted the hat again, and Susan scuttled off to sit next
to Hannah.
“Boot, Terry!”
“RAVENCLAW!”
The table second from the left clapped this time; several Ravenclaws stood
up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them.
“Brocklehurst, Mandy” went to Ravenclaw too, but “Brown, Lavender”
became the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far left exploded withcheers; Harry could see Ron’s twin brothers catcalling.
“Bulstrode, Millicent” then became Madam Pomfrey.
She is already tending to Miss Fawcett, of Ravenclaw, and Mr. Summers, of
Hufflepuff, both of whom decided to age themselves up a little too. Though I
must say, neither of their beards is anything like as fine as yours.”
Fred and George set off for the hospital wing, accompanied by Lee, who
was howling with laughter, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione, also chortling,
went in to breakfast.
The decorations in the Great Hall had changed this morning. As it was
Halloween, a cloud of live bats was fluttering around the enchanted ceiling,
while hundreds of carved pumpkins leered from every corner. Harry led the
way over to Dean and Seamus, who were discussing those Hogwarts students
of seventeen or over who might be entering.
“There’s a rumor going around that Warrington got up early and put his
name in,” Dean told Harry. “That big bloke from Slytherin who looks like a
sloth.”
Harry, who had played Quidditch against Warrington, shook his head indisgust.
“We can’t have a Slytherin champion!”
“And all the H"
What creature is Buckbeak?,Hippogriff,Buckbeak is a hippogriff.,"ing flat on his back with his arms and legs in the
air, gave Harry one upside-down look of deepest loathing and, with another
loud crack, vanished.
“Good,” said Dumbledore. “There is also the matter of the hippogriff,
Buckbeak. Hagrid has been looking after him since Sirius died, but Buckbeak
is yours now, so if you would prefer to make different arrangements —”
“No,” said Harry at once, “he can stay with Hagrid. I think Buckbeak
would prefer that.”
“Hagrid will be delighted,” said Dumbledore, smiling. “He was thrilled to
see Buckbeak again. Incidentally, we have decided, in the interests of
Buckbeak’s safety, to rechristen him ‘Witherwings’ for the time being, though
I doubt that the Ministry would ever guess he is the hippogriff they once
sentenced to death. Now, Harry, is your trunk packed?”
“Erm . . .”
“Doubtful that I would turn up?” Dumbledore suggested shrewdly.
“I’ll just go and — er — finish off,” said Harry hastily, hurrying to pick up
his fallen telescope and trainers.
It took him a little over ten d. I’ll
make it quick. And then you and Macnair need to sign it. Macnair, you’re
supposed to listen too, that’s procedure —”
Macnair’s face vanished from the window. It was now or never.
“Wait here,” Harry whispered to Hermione. “I’ll do it.”
As Fudge’s voice started again, Harry darted out from behind his tree,
vaulted the fence into the pumpkin patch, and approached Buckbeak.
“It is the decision of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous
Creatures that the hippogriff Buckbeak, hereafter called the condemned, shall
be executed on the sixth of June at sundown —”
Careful not to blink, Harry stared up into Buckbeak’s fierce orange eyes
once more and bowed. Buckbeak sank to his scaly knees and then stood up
again. Harry began to fumble with the knot of rope tying Buckbeak to the
fence.
“. . . sentenced to execution by beheading, to be carried out by the
Committee’s appointed executioner, Walden Macnair . . .”
“Come on, Buckbeak,” Harry murmured, “come on, we’re going to help
you. Quietly . . . quietly . . .” 
“How — how — ?” said Black weakly, staring at the hippogriff.
“Get on — there’s not much time,” said Harry, gripping Buckbeak firmly
on either side of his sleek neck to hold him steady. “You’ve got to get out of
here — the dementors are coming — Macnair’s gone to get them.”
Black placed a hand on either side of the window frame and heaved his
head and shoulders out of it. It was very lucky he was so thin. In seconds, he
had managed to fling one leg over Buckbeak’s back and pull himself onto the
hippogriff behind Hermione.
“Okay, Buckbeak, up!” said Harry, shaking the rope. “Up to the tower —
come on!”
The hippogriff gave one sweep of its mighty wings and they were soaring
upward again, high as the top of the West Tower. Buckbeak landed with a
clatter on the battlements, and Harry and Hermione slid off him at once.
“Sirius, you’d better go, quick,” Harry panted. “They’ll reach Flitwick’s
office any moment, they’ll find out you’re gone.”
Buckbeak pawed the ground, tossing his sharp head.
“What happened to the   frightened. Harry could not see
why. The hall was quite empty but for themselves, the sobbing Bellatrix still
trapped under her statue, and the tiny baby Fawkes croaking feebly on the
floor —
And then Harry’s scar burst open. He knew he was dead: it was pain
beyond imagining, pain past endurance —
He was gone from the hall, he was locked in the coils of a creature with red
eyes, so tightly bound that Harry did not know where his body ended and the
creature’s began. They were fused together, bound by pain, and there was no
escape —
And when the creature spoke, it used Harry’s mouth, so that in his agony he
felt his jaw move. . . .
“Kill me now, Dumbledore . . .”
Blinded and dying, every part of him screaming for release, Harry felt the
creature use him again. . . .
“If death is nothing, Dumbledore, kill the boy . . .”Let the pain stop,
 thought Harry. 
Let him kill us. . . . End it,
Dumbledore. . . . Death is nothing compared to this. . . .
And I’ll see Sirius again. . . .
And as Harry’s heart filled with emo y, Ron, and
Hermione whip around. Buckbeak the hippogriff was lying in the corner,
chomping on something that was oozing blood all over the floor.
“I couldn’ leave him tied up out there in the snow!” choked Hagrid. “All on
his own! At Christmas.”
Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another. They had never seen eye
to eye with Hagrid about what he called “interesting creatures” and other
people called “terrifying monsters.” On the other hand, there didn’t seem to
be any particular harm in Buckbeak. In fact, by Hagrid’s usual standards, he
was positively cute.
“You’ll have to put up a good strong defense, Hagrid,” said Hermione,
sitting down and laying a hand on Hagrid’s massive forearm. “I’m sure you
can prove Buckbeak is safe.”
“Won’t make no diff’rence!” sobbed Hagrid. “Them Disposal devils,
they’re all in Lucius Malfoy’s pocket! Scared o’ him! An’ if I lose the case,
Buckbeak —”
Hagrid drew his finger swiftly across his throat, then gave a great wail and
lurched forward, his face in his arms.
“What about up there yet?” said Harry, checking his watch. He
looked up at the castle and began counting the windows to the right of theWest Tower.
“Look!” Hermione whispered. “Who’s that? Someone’s coming back out of
the castle!”
Harry stared through the darkness. The man was hurrying across the
grounds, toward one of the entrances. Something shiny glinted in his belt.
“Macnair!” said Harry. “The executioner! He’s gone to get the dementors!
This is it, Hermione —”
Hermione put her hands on Buckbeak’s back and Harry gave her a leg up.
Then he placed his foot on one of the lower branches of the bush and climbed
up in front of her. He pulled Buckbeak’s rope back over his neck and tied it to
the other side of his collar like reins.
“Ready?” he whispered to Hermione. “You’d better hold on to me —”
He nudged Buckbeak’s sides with his heels.
Buckbeak soared straight into the dark air. Harry gripped his flanks with his
knees, feeling the great wings rising powerfully beneath them. Hermione was
holding Harry very tight around th spered. “He’s transforming —”
“Hermione!” said Harry suddenly. “We’ve got to move!”
“We mustn’t, I keep telling you —”
“Not to interfere! Lupin’s going to run into the forest, right at us!”
Hermione gasped.
“Quick!” she moaned, dashing to untie Buckbeak. “Quick! Where are we
going to go? Where are we going to hide? The dementors will be coming any
moment —”
“Back to Hagrid’s!” Harry said. “It’s empty now — come on!”
They ran as fast as they could, Buckbeak cantering along behind them.
They could hear the werewolf howling behind them. . . .
The cabin was in sight; Harry skidded to the door, wrenched it open, and
Hermione and Buckbeak flashed past him; Harry threw himself in after them
and bolted the door. Fang the boarhound barked loudly.
“Shh, Fang, it’s us!” said Hermione, hurrying over and scratching his ears
to quieten him. “That was really close!” she said to Harry.“Yeah . . .”
Harry was looking out of the window. It was much harder to see what was
going on from here. Buckbeak seemed very happy to find hi e waist; he could hear her muttering, “Oh,
no — I don’t like this — oh, I 
really
 don’t like this —”
Harry urged Buckbeak forward. They were gliding quietly toward the
upper floors of the castle. . . . Harry pulled hard on the left-hand side of the
rope, and Buckbeak turned. Harry was trying to count the windows flashing
past —
“Whoa!” he said, pulling backward as hard as he could.
Buckbeak slowed down and they found themselves at a stop, unless you
counted the fact that they kept rising up and down several feet as the
hippogriff beat his wings to remain airborne.
“He’s there!” Harry said, spotting Sirius as they rose up beside the window.
He reached out, and as Buckbeak’s wings fell, was able to tap sharply on the
glass.
Black looked up. Harry saw his jaw drop. He leapt from his chair, hurried
to the window, and tried to open it, but it was locked.“Stand back!” Hermione called to him, and she took out her wand, still
gripping the back of Harry’s robes with her left hand.
“Alohomora!”
The window sprang open."
Who is the founder of Gryffindor House?,Godric Gryffindor,Godric Gryffindor is the founder of Gryffindor House.,"was in Dumbledore’s office,
knowing he would shortly be telling him about the dream. Harry looked up at
the walls behind the desk. The patched and ragged Sorting Hat was standing
on a shelf. A glass case next to it held a magnificent silver sword with large
rubies set into the hilt, which Harry recognized as the one he himself had
pulled out of the Sorting Hat in his second year. The sword had once belonged
to Godric Gryffindor, founder of Harry’s House. He was gazing at it,
remembering how it had come to his aid when he had thought all hope was
lost, when he noticed a patch of silvery light, dancing and shimmering on the
glass case. He looked around for the source of the light and saw a sliver of
silver-white shining brightly from within a black cabinet behind him, whose
door had not been closed properly. Harry hesitated, glanced at Fawkes, then
got up, walked across the office, and pulled open the cabinet door.A shallow stone basin lay there, with odd carvings around the edge: runes
and symbols that Harry d  he looked like a radish with a bad sunburn.
“. . . for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years, I
award Gryffindor House fifty points.”
Gryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; the stars overhead
seemed to quiver. Percy could be heard telling the other prefects, “My
brother, you know! My youngest brother! Got past McGonagall’s giant chess
set!”
At last there was silence again.
“Second — to Miss Hermione Granger . . . for the use of cool logic in the
face of fire, I award Gryffindor House fifty points.”
Hermione buried her face in her arms; Harry strongly suspected she hadburst into tears. Gryffindors up and down the table were beside themselves —
they were a hundred points up.
“Third — to Mr. Harry Potter . . .” said Dumbledore. The room went
deadly quiet. “. . . for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor
House sixty points.”
The din was deafening. Those who could add up while yelling themselves
hoarse knew that Gryffindor now had four hundred and seventy-t rom a doorway to the right — the
rest of the school must already be here — but Professor McGonagall showed
the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in,
standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering
about nervously.
“Welcome to Hogwarts,” said Professor McGonagall. “The start-of-term
banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall,
you will be sorted into your Houses. The Sorting is a very importantceremony because, while you are here, your House will be something like
your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your
House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free time in your House
common room.
“The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and
Slytherin. Each House has its own noble history and each has produced
outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs
will earn your House points, while any rule-breaking will lose House points.
At the end of the id in front of me that he never assumed he knew all of
Hogwarts’s secrets. I’m telling you, if there was one place Vol —”
“Oi!”
“YOU-KNOW-WHO, then!” Harry shouted, goaded past endurance. “If
there was one place that was really important to You-Know-Who, it was
Hogwarts!”
“Oh, come on,” scoffed Ron. “His 
school
?”“Yeah, his school! It was his first real home, the place that meant he was
special; it meant everything to him, and even after he left —”
“This is You-Know-Who we’re talking about, right? Not you?” inquired
Ron. He was tugging at the chain of the Horcrux around his neck: Harry was
visited by a desire to seize it and throttle him.
“You told us that You-Know-Who asked Dumbledore to give him a job
after he left,” said Hermione.
“That’s right,” said Harry.
“And Dumbledore thought he only wanted to come back to try and find
something, probably another founder’s object, to make into another
Horcrux?”
“Yeah,” said Harry.
“But he didn’t get the job, did he?” said Hermione. “So he never got the
chance to fin  sat, ancient and
unmoving. “How soon Riddle learned that the famous founder of the House
could talk to snakes, I do not know — perhaps that very evening. The
knowledge can only have excited him and increased his sense of self-
importance.
“However, if he was frightening or impressing fellow Slytherins with
displays of Parseltongue in their common room, no hint of it reached the staff.
He showed no sign of outward arrogance or aggression at all. As an unusually
talented and very good-looking orphan, he naturally drew attention and
sympathy from the staff almost from the moment of his arrival. He seemed
polite, quiet, and thirsty for knowledge. Nearly all were most favorably
impressed by him.”
“Didn’t you tell them, sir, what he’d been like when you met him at the
orphanage?” asked Harry.
“No, I did not. Though he had shown no hint of remorse, it was possible
that he felt sorry for how he had behaved before and was resolved to turn overa fresh leaf. I chose to give him that chance.”
Dumbledore paused and looke House you’ll be in?
I’ve been asking around, and I hope I’m in Gryffindor, it sounds by far the
best; I hear Dumbledore himself was in it, but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn’t
be too bad. . . . Anyway, we’d better go and look for Neville’s toad. You two
had better change, you know, I expect we’ll be there soon.”
And she left, taking the toadless boy with her.“Whatever House I’m in, I hope she’s not in it,” said Ron. He threw his
wand back into his trunk. “Stupid spell — George gave it to me, bet he knew
it was a dud.”
“What House are your brothers in?” asked Harry.
“Gryffindor,” said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling on him again. “Mum
and Dad were in it, too. I don’t know what they’ll say if I’m not. I don’t
suppose Ravenclaw 
would
 be too bad, but imagine if they put me in
Slytherin.”
“That’s the House Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who was in?”
“Yeah,” said Ron. He flopped back into his seat, looking depressed.
“You know, I think the ends of Scabbers’ whiskers are a bit lighter,” said
Harry, trying to take Ron’s mind  arn them.
“I’m disgusted,” said Professor McGonagall. “Four students out of bed in
one night! I’ve never heard of such a thing before! You, Miss Granger, I
thought you had more sense. As for you, Mr. Potter, I thought Gryffindor
meant more to you than this. All three of you will receive detentions — yes,
you too, Mr. Longbottom, 
nothing
 gives you the right to walk around school
at night, especially these days, it’s very dangerous — and fifty points will be
taken from Gryffindor.”
“Fifty?”
 Harry gasped — they would lose the lead, the lead he’d won in
the last Quidditch match.
“Fifty points 
each,
” said Professor McGonagall, breathing heavily through
her long, pointed nose.
“Professor — please —”
“You 
can’t
 —”
“Don’t tell me what I can and can’t do, Potter. Now get back to bed, all of
you. I’ve never been more ashamed of Gryffindor students.”A hundred and fifty points lost. That put Gryffindor in last place. In one
night, they’d ruined any chance Gryffindor had had for the House Cup. Harry
felt as though   he was being wrenched inside
the common room by about a dozen pairs of hands, and was facing the whole
of Gryffindor House, all of whom were screaming, applauding, and whistling.
“You should’ve told us you’d entered!” bellowed Fred; he looked half
annoyed, half deeply impressed.
“How did you do it without getting a beard? Brilliant!” roared George.
“I didn’t,” Harry said. “I don’t know how —”
But Angelina had now swooped down upon him; “Oh if it couldn’t be me,at least it’s a Gryffindor —”
“You’ll be able to pay back Diggory for that last Quidditch match, Harry!”
shrieked Katie Bell, another of the Gryffindor Chasers.
“We’ve got food, Harry, come and have some —”
“I’m not hungry, I had enough at the feast —”
But nobody wanted to hear that he wasn’t hungry; nobody wanted to hear
that he hadn’t put his name in the goblet; not one single person seemed to
have noticed that he wasn’t at all in the mood to celebrate. . . . Lee Jordan had
unearthed a Gryffindor banner from somewhere, and he insisted on draping it

“Yeah, we don’t need to hear about you being in love with Malfoy,” Harry
told Kreacher. “Let’s fast forward to where he’s actually been going.”
Kreacher bowed again, looking furious, and then said, “Master Malfoy eats
in the Great Hall, he sleeps in a dormitory in the dungeons, he attends his
classes in a variety of —”
“Dobby, you tell me,” said Harry, cutting across Kreacher. “Has he been
going anywhere he shouldn’t have?”
“Harry Potter, sir,” squeaked Dobby, his great orblike eyes shining in the
firelight, “the Malfoy boy is breaking no rules that Dobby can discover, but
he is still keen to avoid detection. He has been making regular visits to the
seventh floor with a variety of other students, who keep watch for him while
he enters —”“The Room of Requirement!” said Harry, smacking himself hard on the
forehead with

 Hermione and Ron stared at him.

“You see?” he whispered. “It was a name I was already using at Hogwarts,
to my most intimate friends only, of course. You think I was going to use my
filthy Muggle father’s name forever? I, in whose veins runs the blood of
Salazar Slytherin himself, through my mother’s side? I, keep the name of a
foul, common Muggle, who abandoned me even before I was born, just
because he found out his wife was a witch? No, Harry — I fashioned myself a
new name, a name I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak,when I had become the greatest sorcerer in the world!”
Harry’s brain seemed to have jammed. He stared numbly at Riddle, at the
orphaned boy who had grown up to murder Harry’s own parents, and so many
others. . . . At last he forced himself to speak.
“You’re not,” he said, his quiet voice full of hatred.
“Not what?” snapped Riddle.
“Not the greatest sorcerer in the world,” said Harry, breathing fast. “Sorry
to disappoint you and all that, but the grea “Ah, speak not the
name, sir! Speak not the name!”
“Sorry,” said Harry quickly. “I know lots of people don’t like it. My friend
Ron —”
He stopped again. Thinking about Ron was painful, too.
Dobby leaned toward Harry, his eyes wide as headlights.
“Dobby heard tell,” he said hoarsely, “that Harry Potter met the Dark Lord
for a second time, just weeks ago . . . that Harry Potter escaped 
yet again.
”
Harry nodded and Dobby’s eyes suddenly shone with tears.
“Ah, sir,” he gasped, dabbing his face with a corner of the grubby
pillowcase he was wearing. “Harry Potter is valiant and bold! He has braved
so many dangers already! But Dobby has come to protect Harry Potter, to
warn him, even if he 
does
 have to shut his ears in the oven door later. . . .
Harry Potter must not go back to Hogwarts.
”
There was a silence broken only by the chink of knives and forks from
downstairs and the distant rumble of Uncle Vernon’s voice.
“W-what?” Harry stammered. “But I’ve got to go back — term starts on

CHAPTER  ONE
THE BOY WHO LIVED
r. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say
that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much . Again, your readers will have to buy my book for the
whole story, but there is no question that Dumbledore took an unnatural
interest in Potter from the word go. Whether that was really in the boy’s
best interests — well, we’ll see. It’s certainly an open secret that Potter
has had a most troubled adolescence.”
I ask whether Skeeter is still in touch with Harry Potter, whom she so
famously interviewed last year: a breakthrough piece in which Potter
spoke exclusively of his conviction that You-Know-Who had returned.
“Oh, yes, we’ve developed a close bond,” says Skeeter. “Poor Potter
has few real friends, and we met at one of the most testing moments of
his life — the Triwizard Tournament. I am probably one of the only
people alive who can say that they know the real Harry Potter.”
Which leads us neatly to the many rumors still circulating about
Dumbledore’s final hours. Does Skeeter believe that Potter was there
when Dumbledore died?
“Well, I don’t want to say too much — it’s all in the book — but
eyewitness born girl who, like
Harry, is one of the top students in the school.
From the moment the article had appeared, Harry had had to endure people
— Slytherins, mainly — quoting it at him as he passed and making sneering
comments.
“Want a hanky, Potter, in case you start crying in Transfiguration?”
“Since when have you been one of the top students in the school, Potter?
Or is this a school you and Longbottom have set up together?”
“Hey — Harry!”“Yeah, that’s right!” Harry found himself shouting as he wheeled around in
the corridor, having had just about enough. “I’ve just been crying my eyes out
over my dead mum, and I’m just off to do a bit more. . . .”
“No — it was just — you dropped your quill.”
It was Cho. Harry felt the color rising in his face.
“Oh — right — sorry,” he muttered, taking the quill back.
“Er . . . good luck on Tuesday,” she said. “I really hope you do well.”
Which left Harry feeling extremely stupid.
Hermione had come in for her fair share of unpleasantness too, but she
hadn’t yet started yelli .
Harry pulled the Cloak off himself, raised his wand, and said, “You
shouldn’t have done that.”
As Amycus spun around, Harry shouted, 
“Crucio!”
The Death Eater was lifted off his feet. He writhed through the air like a
drowning man, thrashing and howling in pain, and then, with a crunch and ashattering of glass, he smashed into the front of a bookcase and crumpled,
insensible, to the floor.
“I see what Bellatrix meant,” said Harry, the blood thundering through his
brain, “you need to really mean it.”
“Potter!” whispered Professor McGonagall, clutching her heart. “Potter —
you’re here! What — ? How — ?” She struggled to pull herself together.
“Potter, that was foolish!”
“He spat at you,” said Harry.
“Potter, I — that was very — very 
gallant 
of you — but don’t you realize
— ?”
“Yeah, I do,” Harry assured her. Somehow her panic steadied him.
“Professor McGonagall, Voldemort’s on the way.”
“Oh, are we allowed to say the name now?” asked Luna with an air of
interest, pulling off the Invisibility Cloak. This ap hen, “let’s keep looking,” and he turned away,
wishing he had not seen the stone: He did not want his excited trepidation
tainted with resentment.
“Here!” cried Hermione again a few moments later from out of the
darkness. “Oh no, sorry! I thought it said Potter.”
She was rubbing at a crumbling, mossy stone, gazing down at it, a little
frown on her face.
“Harry, come back a moment.”He did not want to be sidetracked again, and only grudgingly made his way
back through the snow toward her.
“What?”
“Look at this!”
The grave was extremely old, weathered so that Harry could hardly make
out the name. Hermione showed him the symbol beneath it.
“Harry, that’s the mark in the book!”
He peered at the place she indicated: The stone was so worn that it was
hard to make out what was engraved there, though there did seem to be a
triangular mark beneath the nearly illegible name.
“Yeah . . . it could be. . . .”
Hermione lit her wand and pointed it at the name on the headstone.
“It says Ig
 — 
Ignotus, I think. . . .”
“I’m go"
