Who is Harry Potter's best friend?,Ron Weasley,"According to the context, Harry Potter's best friend was Sirius Black, his godfather, and James Potter, his father.","say you remember him at Hogwarts, Rosmerta,” murmured Professor
McGonagall. “Do you remember who his best friend was?”
“Naturally,” said Madam Rosmerta, with a small laugh. “Never saw one
without the other, did you? The number of times I had them in here — ooh,
they used to make me laugh. Quite the double act, Sirius Black and James
Potter!”
Harry dropped his tankard with a loud clunk. Ron kicked him.
“Precisely,” said Professor McGonagall. “Black and Potter. Ringleaders of
their little gang. Both very bright, of course — exceptionally bright, in fact —
but I don’t think we’ve ever had such a pair of troublemakers —”
“I dunno,” chuckled Hagrid. “Fred and George Weasley could give ’em a
run fer their money.”
“You’d have thought Black and Potter were brothers!” chimed in Professor
Flitwick. “Inseparable!”
“Of course they were,” said Fudge. “Potter trusted Black beyond all his
other friends. Nothing changed when they left school. Black was best man
when James married Lily. Then they named him godfather to Harry. or
companionship on his trip to Diagon Alley. He preferred to operate alone. The
adult Voldemort is the same. You will hear many of his Death Eaters claiming
that they are in his confidence, that they alone are close to him, even
understand him. They are deluded. Lord Voldemort has never had a friend,
nor do I believe that he has ever wanted one.
“And lastly — I hope you are not too sleepy to pay attention to this, Harry
— the young Tom Riddle liked to collect trophies. You saw the box of stolen
articles he had hidden in his room. These were taken from victims of his
bullying behavior, souvenirs, if you will, of particularly unpleasant bits of
magic. Bear in mind this magpie-like tendency, for this, particularly, will be
important later.“And now, it really is time for bed.”
Harry got to his feet. As he walked across the room, his eyes fell upon the
little table on which Marvolo Gaunt’s ring had rested last time, but the ring
was no longer there.
“Yes, Harry?” said Dumbledore, for Harry had come to a halt.
“Th AMILY!”
And he threw the receiver back onto the telephone as if dropping a
poisonous spider.The fight that had followed had been one of the worst ever.
“HOW DARE YOU GIVE THIS NUMBER TO PEOPLE LIKE —
PEOPLE LIKE 
YOU
!”
 
Uncle Vernon had roared, spraying Harry with spit.
Ron obviously realized that he’d gotten Harry into trouble, because he
hadn’t called again. Harry’s other best friend from Hogwarts, Hermione
Granger, hadn’t been in touch either. Harry suspected that Ron had warned
Hermione not to call, which was a pity, because Hermione, the cleverest witch
in Harry’s year, had Muggle parents, knew perfectly well how to use a
telephone, and would probably have had enough sense not to say that she
went to Hogwarts.
So Harry had had no word from any of his wizarding friends for five long
weeks, and this summer was turning out to be almost as bad as the last one.
There was just one very small improvement — after swearing that he
wouldn’t use her to send letters to any of his friends, Harry had been allowed
to"
What house is Harry Potter sorted into?,Gryffindor,"According to the text, Harry Potter is sorted into Gryffindor House."," you are here, your House will be something like
your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your
House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free time in your House
common room.
“The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and
Slytherin. Each House has its own noble history and each has produced
outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs
will earn your House points, while any rule-breaking will lose House points.
At the end of the year, the House with the most points is awarded the House
Cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever House
becomes yours.
“The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest
of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can
while you are waiting.”
Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville’s cloak, which was fastened
under his left ear, and on Ron’s smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to
flatten his hair.
“I shall return when we are r rom a doorway to the right — the
rest of the school must already be here — but Professor McGonagall showed
the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in,
standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering
about nervously.
“Welcome to Hogwarts,” said Professor McGonagall. “The start-of-term
banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall,
you will be sorted into your Houses. The Sorting is a very importantceremony because, while you are here, your House will be something like
your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your
House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free time in your House
common room.
“The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and
Slytherin. Each House has its own noble history and each has produced
outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs
will earn your House points, while any rule-breaking will lose House points.
At the end of the House you’ll be in?
I’ve been asking around, and I hope I’m in Gryffindor, it sounds by far the
best; I hear Dumbledore himself was in it, but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn’t
be too bad. . . . Anyway, we’d better go and look for Neville’s toad. You two
had better change, you know, I expect we’ll be there soon.”
And she left, taking the toadless boy with her.“Whatever House I’m in, I hope she’s not in it,” said Ron. He threw his
wand back into his trunk. “Stupid spell — George gave it to me, bet he knew
it was a dud.”
“What House are your brothers in?” asked Harry.
“Gryffindor,” said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling on him again. “Mum
and Dad were in it, too. I don’t know what they’ll say if I’m not. I don’t
suppose Ravenclaw 
would
 be too bad, but imagine if they put me in
Slytherin.”
“That’s the House Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who was in?”
“Yeah,” said Ron. He flopped back into his seat, looking depressed.
“You know, I think the ends of Scabbers’ whiskers are a bit lighter,” said
Harry, trying to take Ron’s mind "
What is the name of Harry Potter's owl?,Hedwig,The name of Harry Potter's owl is Hedwig.,"rry Potter’s, incidentally, who fought the Death Eaters
alongside him at the Ministry in June and —”
But the rest of this story was obscured by the large birdcage standing on
top of it. Inside it was a magnificent snowy owl. Her amber eyes surveyed the
room imperiously, her head swiveling occasionally to gaze at her snoring
master. Once or twice she clicked her beak impatiently, but Harry was too
deeply asleep to hear her.
A large trunk stood in the very middle of the room. Its lid was open; it
looked expectant; yet it was almost empty but for a residue of old underwear,
sweets, empty ink bottles, and broken quills that coated the very bottom.
Nearby, on the floor, lay a purple leaflet emblazoned with the words:

PROTECTING YOUR HOME AND FAMILY AGAINST DARK

The Wizarding community is currently under threat from an organization
calling itself the Death Eaters. Observing the following simple securityguidelines will help protect you, your family, and yo h was large and gray, keeled right over and lay
motionless. There was a large package tied to its legs.
Harry recognized the unconscious owl at once — his name was Errol, and
he belonged to the Weasley family. Harry dashed to the bed, untied the cords
around Errol’s legs, took off the parcel, and then carried Errol to Hedwig’s
cage. Errol opened one bleary eye, gave a feeble hoot of thanks, and began to
gulp some water.
Harry turned back to the remaining owls. One of them, the large snowy
female, was his own Hedwig. She, too, was carrying a parcel and looked
extremely pleased with herself. She gave Harry an affectionate nip with her
beak as he removed her burden, then flew across the room to join Errol.
Harry didn’t recognize the third owl, a handsome tawny one, but he knew
at once where it had come from, because in addition to a third package, it was
carrying a letter bearing the Hogwarts crest. When Harry relieved this owl of
its burden, it ruffled its feathers importantly, stretched its wings, and took off sick of finding everything out from the
Slytherins.”
“Good thinking!” said Harry, also looking up at the owls. “Hey, Hermione,
I think you’re in luck —”
A gray owl was soaring down toward Hermione.“It hasn’t got a newspaper, though,” she said, looking disappointed. “It’s
—”
But to her bewilderment, the gray owl landed in front of her plate, closely
followed by four barn owls, a brown owl, and a tawny.
“How many subscriptions did you take out?” said Harry, seizing
Hermione’s goblet before it was knocked over by the cluster of owls, all of
whom were jostling close to her, trying to deliver their own letter first.
“What on earth — ?” Hermione said, taking the letter from the gray owl,
opening it, and starting to read. “Oh really!” she sputtered, going rather red.
“What’s up?” said Ron.
“It’s — oh how ridiculous —”
She thrust the letter at Harry, who saw that it was not handwritten, but
composed from pasted letters that seemed to have been cut out of the

Who is the headmaster of Hogwarts?,Albus Dumbledore,The headmaster of Hogwarts is Severus Snape.,"red
parchment.
A large picture of a familiar, hook-nosed, black-haired man stared up at
them all, beneath a headline that read:
SEVERUS SNAPE CONFIRMED AS HOGWARTS HEADMASTER
“No!” said Ron and Hermione loudly.
Hermione was quickest; she snatched up the newspaper and began to read
the accompanying story out loud.
“‘Severus Snape, long-standing Potions master at Hogwarts School of
Witchcraft and Wizardry, was today appointed headmaster in the most
important of several staffing changes at the ancient school. Following the
resignation of the previous Muggle Studies teacher, Alecto Carrow will take
over the post while her brother, Amycus, fills the position of Defense Against
the Dark Arts professor.
“
‘I welcome the opportunity to uphold our finest Wizarding traditions and
values —’ 
Like committing murder and cutting off people’s ears, I suppose!
Snape, headmaster! Snape in Dumbledore’s study — Merlin’s pants!” she
shrieked, making both Harry and Ron jump. She leapt up from the table and
hurtled from the room,  unfolded it, and read it, with Ron,
Seamus, Dean, and Neville looking over his shoulder. It was an article topped
with a picture of Hagrid looking extremely shifty.
DUMBLEDORE’S GIANT MISTAKE
Albus Dumbledore, eccentric headmaster of Hogwarts School of
Witchcraft and Wizardry, has never been afraid to make
controversial staff appointments, 
writes Rita Skeeter, Special
Correspondent.
 In September of this year, he hired Alastor “Mad-
Eye” Moody, the notoriously jinx-happy ex-Auror, to teach Defense
Against the Dark Arts, a decision that caused many raised eyebrows
at the Ministry of Magic, given Moody’s well-known habit of
attacking anybody who makes a sudden movement in his presence.
Mad-Eye Moody, however, looks responsible and kindly when set
beside the part-human Dumbledore employs to teach Care ofMagical Creatures.
Rubeus Hagrid, who admits to being expelled from Hogwarts in
his third year, has enjoyed the position of gamekeeper at the school
ever since, a job secured for him by Dumbledore. Last year,
ho werewolf Remus Lupin, half-giant Rubeus Hagrid, and delusional
ex-Auror ‘Mad-Eye’ Moody.
“Rumors abound, of course, that Albus Dumbledore, once Supreme
Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards and Chief Warlock
of the Wizengamot, is no longer up to the task of managing the prestigious
school of Hogwarts.
“‘I think the appointment of the Inquisitor is a first step toward ensuring
that Hogwarts has a headmaster in whom we can all repose confidence,’ said
a Ministry insider last night.
“Wizengamot elders Griselda Marchbanks and Tiberius Ogden have
resigned in protest at the introduction of the post of Inquisitor to Hogwarts.
“‘Hogwarts is a school, not an outpost of Cornelius Fudge’s office,’ said
Madam Marchbanks. ‘This is a further disgusting attempt to discredit Albus
Dumbledore.’ (For a full account of Madam Marchbanks’ alleged links to
subversive goblin groups, turn to page 17.)”
Hermione finished reading and looked across the table at the other two.

Anthony Goldstein, his own wand would fly out of his hand, yet Anthony did
not seem to be making a sound. Harry did not have to look far for the solution
of the mystery, however; Fred and George were several feet from Smith and
taking it in turns to point their wands at his back.
“Sorry, Harry,” said George hastily, when Harry caught his eye. “Couldn’t
resist . . .”
Harry walked around the other pairs, trying to correct those who were
doing the spell wrong. Ginny was teamed with Michael Corner; she was
doing very well, whereas Michael was either very bad or unwilling to jinx her.
Ernie Macmillan was flourishing his wand unnecessarily, giving his partner
time to get in under his guard; the Creevey brothers were enthusiastic but
erratic and mainly responsible for all the books leaping off the shelves around
them. Luna Lovegood was similarly patchy, occasionally sending Justin
Finch-Fletchley’s wand spinning out of his hand, at other times merely
causing his hair to stand on end.
“Okay, stop!” Harry s f Zacharias
Smith, who had jeered at Harry for wanting to teach Dumbledore’s Army how
to Disarm.
“Yes, Harry,” said Lupin with painful restraint, “and a great number of
Death Eaters witnessed that happening! Forgive me, but it was a very unusual
move then, under imminent threat of death. Repeating it tonight in front of
Death Eaters who either witnessed or heard about the first occasion was close
to suicidal!”
“So you think I should have killed Stan Shunpike?” said Harry angrily.
“Of course not,” said Lupin, “but the Death Eaters — frankly, most people!
— would have expected you to attack back! Expelliarmus is a useful spell,
Harry, but the Death Eaters seem to think it is your signature move, and I urgeyou not to let it become so!”
Lupin was making Harry feel idiotic, and yet there was still a grain of
defiance inside him.
“I won’t blast people out of my way just because they’re there,” said Harry.
“That’s Voldemort’s job.”
Lupin’s retort was lost: Finally succeeding in squeezing through the door,
Hagrid sta  and found himself facing a
Blast-Ended Skrewt.
Cedric was right — it 
was
 enormous. Ten feet long, it looked more like a
giant scorpion than anything. Its long sting was curled over its back. Its thick
armor glinted in the light from Harry’s wand, which he pointed at it.
“Stupefy!”The spell hit the skrewt’s armor and rebounded; Harry ducked just in time,
but could smell burning hair; it had singed the top of his head. The skrewt
issued a blast of fire from its end and flew forward toward him.
“Impedimenta!”
 Harry yelled. The spell hit the skrewt’s armor again and
ricocheted off; Harry staggered back a few paces and fell over.
“IMPEDIMENTA!”
The skrewt was inches from him when it froze — he had managed to hit it
on its fleshy, shell-less underside. Panting, Harry pushed himself away from it
and ran, hard, in the opposite direction — the Impediment Curse was not
permanent; the skrewt would be regaining the use of its legs at any moment.
He took a left path and hit a dead end, a right, and hit another; forcin"

Snape’s back. “Though I would question whether it is advisable to teach them
a potion like the Strengthening Solution. I think the Ministry would prefer it if
that was removed from the syllabus.”
Snape straightened up slowly and turned to look at her.
“Now . . . how long have you been teaching at Hogwarts?” she asked, her
quill poised over her clipboard.
“Fourteen years,” Snape replied. His expression was unfathomable. His
eyes on Snape, Harry added a few drops to his potion; it hissed menacingly
and turned from turquoise to orange.
“You applied first for the Defense Against the Dark Arts post, I believe?”
Professor Umbridge asked Snape.
“Yes,” said Snape quietly.
“But you were unsuccessful?”
Snape’s lip curled.
“Obviously.”
Professor Umbridge scribbled on her clipboard.
“And you have applied regularly for the Defense Against the Dark Arts
post since you first joined the school, I believe?”
“Yes,” said Snape quietly, barely moving his lips. He looked very angry.
“Do you have   Thursday afternoon’s double
Potions lesson loomed nearer, “is a diversion. Then one of us can sneak into
Snape’s office and take what we need.”
Harry and Ron looked at her nervously.
“I think I’d better do the actual stealing,” Hermione continued in a matter-
of-fact tone. “You two will be expelled if you get into any more trouble, and
I’ve got a clean record. So all you need to do is cause enough mayhem to
keep Snape busy for five minutes or so.”
Harry smiled feebly. Deliberately causing mayhem in Snape’s Potions class
was about as safe as poking a sleeping dragon in the eye.
Potions lessons took place in one of the large dungeons. Thursday
afternoon’s lesson proceeded in the usual way. Twenty cauldrons stood
steaming between the wooden desks, on which stood brass scales and jars of
ingredients. Snape prowled through the fumes, making waspish remarks about
the Gryffindors’ work while the Slytherins sniggered appreciatively. Draco
Malfoy, who was Snape’s favorite student, kept flicking puffer-fish eyes at
Ro s lesson, he knew he’d been wrong.
Snape didn’t dislike Harry — he 
hated
 him.
Potions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons. It was colder here
than up in the main castle, and would have been quite creepy enough without
the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls.
Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and like
Flitwick, he paused at Harry’s name.
“Ah, yes,” he said softly, “Harry Potter. Our new — 
celebrity
.”
Draco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behind their
hands. Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class. His eyes
were black like Hagrid’s, but they had none of Hagrid’s warmth. They were
cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels.
“You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potion-making,”
he began. He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but they caught every
word — like Professor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping a class
silent without effort. “As there is little foolish wand-wavin"

CHAPTER  FOUR
AT FLOURISH AND BLOTTS
ife at the Burrow was as different as possible from life on Privet Drive.
The Dursleys liked everything neat and ordered; the Weasleys’ house
burst with the strange and unexpected. Harry got a shock the first time he
looked in the mirror over the kitchen mantelpiece and it shouted,
“Tuck your
shirt in, scruffy!”
 The ghoul in the attic howled and dropped pipes whenever
he felt things were getting too quiet, and small explosions from Fred and
George’s bedroom were considered perfectly normal. What Harry found most
unusual about life at Ron’s, however, wasn’t the talking mirror or the clanking
ghoul: It was the fact that everybody there seemed to like him.
Mrs. Weasley fussed over the state of his socks and tried to force him to eat
fourth helpings at every meal. Mr. Weasley liked Harry to sit next to him at
the dinner table so that he could bombard him with questions about life with
Muggles  me 
what,
 Arthur?” Mrs. Weasley repeated, in a dangerous sort of
voice.
“It’s nothing, Molly,” mumbled Mr. Weasley, “Fred and George just — but
I’ve had words with them —”
“What have they done this time?” said Mrs. Weasley. “If it’s got anything
to do with Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes —”
“Why don’t you show Harry where he’s sleeping, Ron?” said Hermione
from the doorway.
“He knows where he’s sleeping,” said Ron, “in my room, he slept there last
—”“We can all go,” said Hermione pointedly.
“Oh,” said Ron, cottoning on. “Right.”
“Yeah, we’ll come too,” said George.
“You stay where you are!”
 snarled Mrs. Weasley.
Harry and Ron edged out of the kitchen, and they, Hermione, and Ginny set
off along the narrow hallway and up the rickety staircase that zigzagged
through the house to the upper stories.
“What are Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes?” Harry asked as they climbed.
Ron and Ginny both laughed, although Hermione didn’t.
“Mum found this stack of order forms when she was cleaning Fred and
George’s room,” said Ron quietly.  Slytherins all sing:
Weasley is our King.
 
Weasley was born in a bin,
He always lets the Quaffle in,
Weasley will make sure we win,
Weasley is our King.
 
“— and Alicia passes back to Angelina!” Lee shouted, and as Harry
swerved, his insides boiling at what he had just heard, he knew Lee was
trying to drown out the sound of the singing. “Come on now, Angelina —
looks like she’s got just the Keeper to beat! — SHE SHOOTS — SHE —
aaaah . . .”
Bletchley, the Slytherin Keeper, had saved the goal; he threw the Quaffle to
Warrington who sped off with it, zigzagging in between Alicia and Katie; the
singing from below grew louder and louder as he drew nearer and nearer Ron—
 
Weasley is our King,
Weasley is our King,
He always lets the Quaffle in,
Weasley is our King.
 
Harry could not help himself: Abandoning his search for the Snitch, he
turned his Firebolt toward Ron, a lone figure at the far end of the pitch,
hovering before the three goal hoops while the massive Warrington pelted
toward him . . .

And he knew by her tone that it was his mother and father this time: He
moved toward her, feeling as if something heavy were pressing on his chest,
the same sensation he had had right after Dumbledore had died, a grief that
had actually weighed on his heart and lungs.
The headstone was only two rows behind Kendra and Ariana’s. It was
made of white marble, just like Dumbledore’s tomb, and this made it easy to
read, as it seemed to shine in the dark. Harry did not need to kneel or even
approach very close to it to make out the words engraved upon it.

What platform do students use to board the Hogwarts Express?,Platform 9 3/4,Platform nine and three-quarters.," ten. The only tricky part was doing this in an
unobtrusive way, so as to avoid attracting Muggle attention. They did it in
groups today; Harry, Ron, and Hermione (the most conspicuous, since they
were accompanied by Pigwidgeon and Crookshanks) went first; they leaned
casually against the barrier, chatting unconcernedly, and slid sideways
through it . . . and as they did so, platform nine and three-quarters
materialized in front of them.
The Hogwarts Express, a gleaming scarlet steam engine, was already there,
clouds of steam billowing from it, through which the many Hogwarts students
and parents on the platform appeared like dark ghosts. Pigwidgeon became
noisier than ever in response to the hooting of many owls through the mist.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione set off to find seats, and were soon stowing their
luggage in a compartment halfway along the train. They then hopped back
down onto the platform to say good-bye to Mrs. Weasley, Bill, and Charlie.
“I might be seeing you all sooner than you think,” said Char ough onto
platform nine and three quarters, where the Hogwarts Express stood belching
sooty steam over a platform packed with departing students and their families.Harry inhaled the familiar smell and felt his spirits soar. . . . He was really
going back. . . .
“I hope the others make it in time,” said Mrs. Weasley anxiously, staring
behind her at the wrought-iron arch spanning the platform, through which
new arrivals would come.
“Nice dog, Harry!” called a tall boy with dreadlocks.
“Thanks, Lee,” said Harry, grinning, as Sirius wagged his tail frantically.
“Oh good,” said Mrs. Weasley, sounding relieved, “here’s Alastor with the
luggage, look . . .”
A porter’s cap pulled low over his mismatched eyes, Moody came limping
through the archway pushing a cart full of their trunks.
“All okay,” he muttered to Mrs. Weasley and Tonks. “Don’t think we were
followed . . .”
Seconds later, Mr. Weasley emerged onto the platform with Ron and
Hermione. They had almost unloaded Moody’s luggage cart when Fred,
George, and Ginn  back to us.”
They looked around. People were still watching them, mainly because of
Hedwig’s continuing screeches.
“I think we’d better go and wait by the car,” said Harry. “We’re attracting
too much atten —”
“Harry!” said Ron, his eyes gleaming. “The car!”
“What about it?”
“We can fly the car to Hogwarts!”
“But I thought —”
“We’re stuck, right? And we’ve got to get to school, haven’t we? And even
underage wizards are allowed to use magic if it’s a real emergency, section
nineteen or something of the Restriction of Thingy —”
“But your mum and dad . . .” said Harry, pushing against the barrier again
in the vain hope that it would give way. “How will they get home?”
“They don’t need the car!” said Ron impatiently. “They know how toApparate! You know, just vanish and reappear at home! They only bother
with Floo powder and the car because we’re all underage and we’re not
allowed to Apparate yet. . . .”
Harry’s feeling of panic turned suddenly to excitement.
“Can you fly it?”
“No problem,” said Ron, wheeling his "

and Hermione good-bye, then wheeled the trolley bearing his trunk and
Hedwig’s cage toward Uncle Vernon, who greeted him in his usual fashion.
“What’s that?” he snarled, staring at the envelope Harry was still clutching
in his hand. “If it’s another form for me to sign, you’ve got another —”
“It’s not,” said Harry cheerfully. “It’s a letter from my godfather.”
“Godfather?” spluttered Uncle Vernon. “You haven’t got a godfather!”
“Yes, I have,” said Harry brightly. “He was my mum and dad’s best friend.
He’s a convicted murderer, but he’s broken out of Wizard prison and he’s on
the run. He likes to keep in touch with me, though . . . keep up with my
news . . . check if I’m happy. . . .”
And, grinning broadly at the look of horror on Uncle Vernon’s face, Harry
set off toward the station exit, Hedwig rattling along in front of him, for what

into his previously despised mother’s family — the woman whom, you will
remember, he had thought could not be a witch if she had succumbed to the
shameful human weakness of death.
“All he had to go upon was the single name ‘Marvolo,’ which he knew
from those who ran the orphanage had been his mother’s father’s name.
Finally, after painstaking research through old books of Wizarding families,
he discovered the existence of Slytherin’s surviving line. In the summer of his
sixteenth year, he left the orphanage to which he returned annually and set off
to find his Gaunt relatives. And now, Harry, if you will stand . . .”
Dumbledore rose, and Harry saw that he was again holding a small crystal
bottle filled with swirling, pearly memory.
“I was very lucky to collect this,” he said, as he poured the gleaming mass
into the Pensieve. “As you will understand when we have experienced it.
Shall we?”
Harry stepped up to the stone basin and bowed obediently until his face
sank through the surface of th Harry. But you see what they’re doing? They want to turn you into someone

“We

“And of course, they didn’t report a word about the dementors attacking
you,” said Hermione. “Someone’s told them to keep that quiet. That
should’ve been a really big story, out-of-control dementors. They haven’t
even reported that you broke the International Statute of Secrecy — we
thought they would, it would tie in so well with this image of you as some
stupid show-off — we think they’re biding their time until you’re expelled,

possessions was his Nimbus Two Thousand racing broom.
Harry put the leather case aside and picked up his last parcel. He
recognized the untidy scrawl on the brown paper at once: This was from
Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper. He tore off the top layer of paper and
glimpsed something green and leathery, but before he could unwrap it
properly, the parcel gave a strange quiver, and whatever was inside it snapped
loudly — as though it had jaws.
Harry froze. He knew that Hagrid would never send him anything
dangerous on purpose, but then, Hagrid didn’t have a normal person’s view of
what was dangerous. Hagrid had been known to befriend giant spiders, buy
vicious, three-headed dogs from men in pubs, and sneak illegal dragon eggs
into his cabin.
Harry poked the parcel nervously. It snapped loudly again. Harry reached
for the lamp on his bedside table, gripped it firmly in one hand, and raised it
over his head, ready to strike. Then he seized the rest of the wrapping paper in
his other ha unfolded it, and read it, with Ron,
Seamus, Dean, and Neville looking over his shoulder. It was an article topped
with a picture of Hagrid looking extremely shifty.
DUMBLEDORE’S GIANT MISTAKE
Albus Dumbledore, eccentric headmaster of Hogwarts School of
Witchcraft and Wizardry, has never been afraid to make
controversial staff appointments, 
writes Rita Skeeter, Special
Correspondent.
 In September of this year, he hired Alastor “Mad-
Eye” Moody, the notoriously jinx-happy ex-Auror, to teach Defense
Against the Dark Arts, a decision that caused many raised eyebrows
at the Ministry of Magic, given Moody’s well-known habit of
attacking anybody who makes a sudden movement in his presence.
Mad-Eye Moody, however, looks responsible and kindly when set
beside the part-human Dumbledore employs to teach Care ofMagical Creatures.
Rubeus Hagrid, who admits to being expelled from Hogwarts in
his third year, has enjoyed the position of gamekeeper at the school
ever since, a job secured for him by Dumbledore. Last year,

gleaming silver Tail-Twig Clippers, a tiny brass compass to clip on yourbroom for long journeys, and a 
Handbook of Do-It-Yourself Broomcare.
Apart from his friends, the thing that Harry missed most about Hogwarts
was Quidditch, the most popular sport in the magical world — highly
dangerous, very exciting, and played on broomsticks. Harry happened to be a
very good Quidditch player; he had been the youngest person in a century to
be picked for one of the Hogwarts House teams. One of Harry’s most prized
possessions was his Nimbus Two Thousand racing broom.
Harry put the leather case aside and picked up his last parcel. He
recognized the untidy scrawl on the brown paper at once: This was from
Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper. He tore off the top layer of paper and
glimpsed something green and leathery, but before he could unwrap it

“Yeah, that’s right,” said Ron in a heartened tone. “And we 
have 
got plenty
of time to do it all . . .”
Harry glanced over to his right as they approached the Quidditch pitch, to
where the trees of the Forbidden Forest were swaying darkly. Nothing flew
out of them; the sky was empty but for a few distant owls fluttering around
the Owlery Tower. He had enough to worry about; the flying horse wasn’t
doing him any harm: He pushed it out of his mind.
They collected balls from the cupboard in the changing room and set to
work, Ron guarding the three tall goalposts, Harry playing Chaser and trying
to get the Quaffle past Ron. Harry thought Ron was pretty good; he blocked
three-quarters of the goals Harry attempted to put past him and played better
the longer they practiced. After a couple of hours they returned to the school,
where they ate lunch, during which Hermione made it quite clear that she
thought they were irresponsible, then returned to the Quidditch pitch for the
real tr sed. Ron
doesn’t seem too happy about it.
Harry laughed as he put Hermione’s letter aside and picked up her present.
It was very heavy. Knowing Hermione, he was sure it would be a large book
full of very difficult spells — but it wasn’t. His heart gave a huge bound as he
ripped back the paper and saw a sleek black leather case, with silver words
stamped across it, reading 
Broomstick Servicing Kit
.
“Wow, Hermione!” Harry whispered, unzipping the case to look inside.
There was a large jar of Fleetwood’s High-Finish Handle Polish, a pair of
gleaming silver Tail-Twig Clippers, a tiny brass compass to clip on yourbroom for long journeys, and a 
Handbook of Do-It-Yourself Broomcare.
Apart from his friends, the thing that Harry missed most about Hogwarts
was Quidditch, the most popular sport in the magical world — highly
dangerous, very exciting, and played on broomsticks. Harry happened to be a
very good Quidditch player; he had been the youngest person in a century to
be picked for one of the Hogwarts House team on. At either end of the field were
three golden poles with hoops on the end. They reminded Harry of the little
plastic sticks Muggle children blew bubbles through, except that they were
fifty feet high.
Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry mounted his broomstick and
kicked off from the ground. What a feeling — he swooped in and out of the
goalposts and then sped up and down the field. The Nimbus Two Thousand
turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch.
“Hey, Potter, come down!”
Oliver Wood had arrived. He was carrying a large wooden crate under his
arm. Harry landed next to him.
“Very nice,” said Wood, his eyes glinting. “I see what McGonagall
meant . . . you really are a natural. I’m just going to teach you the rules this
evening, then you’ll be joining team practice three times a week.”
He opened the crate. Inside were four different-sized balls.
“Right,” said Wood. “Now, Quidditch is easy enough to understand, even if
it’s not too easy to play. There are seven players on each side. Three of "

Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington at your service. Resident ghost of
Gryffindor Tower.”
“I know who you are!” said Ron suddenly. “My brothers told me about you
— you’re Nearly Headless Nick!”
“I would 
prefer
 you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy —” the ghost began
stiffly, but sandy-haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted.
“
Nearly
 Headless? How can you be 
nearly
 headless?”
Sir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little chat wasn’t going at
all the way he wanted.
“Like 
this,
” he said irritably. He seized his left ear and pulled. His whole
head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge.
Someone had obviously tried to behead him, but not done it properly.
Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces, Nearly Headless Nick
flipped his head back onto his neck, coughed, and said, “So — new
Gryffindors! I hope you’re going to help us win the House Championship this
year? Gryffindors have never gone so long without winning. Slytherins havegot the Cup six years ching the
bottom of the stairs, where Nearly Headless Nick, ghost of Gryffindor Tower,
stood waiting for him.
“Harry! My dear boy!”Nick made to grasp Harry’s hands with both of his own: Harry’s felt as
though they had been thrust into icy water.
“Nick, you’ve got to help me. Who’s the ghost of Ravenclaw Tower?”
Nearly Headless Nick looked surprised and a little offended.
“The Gray Lady, of course; but if it is ghostly services you require — ?”
“It’s got to be her — d’you know where she is?”
“Let’s see. . . .”
Nick’s head wobbled a little on his ruff as he turned hither and thither,
peering over the heads of the swarming students.
“That’s her over there, Harry, the young woman with the long hair.”
Harry looked in the direction of Nick’s transparent, pointing finger and saw
a tall ghost who caught sight of Harry looking at her, raised her eyebrows, and
drifted away through a solid wall.
Harry ran after her. Once through the door of the corridor into which she
had disappeared, he saw her at the very end of the p ings at friends from other Houses, eyeing one another’s new haircuts and
robes. Again Harry noticed people putting their heads together to whisper as
he passed; he gritted his teeth and tried to act as though he neither noticed nor
cared.
Luna drifted away from them at the Ravenclaw table. The moment they
reached Gryffindor’s, Ginny was hailed by some fellow fourth years and left
to sit with them; Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Neville found seats together
about halfway down the table between Nearly Headless Nick, the Gryffindor
House ghost, and Parvati Patil and Lavender Brown, the last two of whom
gave Harry airy, overly friendly greetings that made him quite sure they had
stopped talking about him a split second before. He had more important
things to worry about, however: He was looking over the students’ heads to
the staff table that ran along the top wall of the Hall.
“He’s not there.”
Ron and Hermione scanned the staff table too, though there was no real
need; Hagrid’s size made him instantly obvious in any"

And they marched off through the crowd of curious Muggles, out of the
station and back onto the side road where the old Ford Anglia was parked.
Ron unlocked the cavernous trunk with a series of taps from his wand.
They heaved their luggage back in, put Hedwig on the back seat, and got into
the front.
“Check that no one’s watching,” said Ron, starting the ignition with another
tap of his wand. Harry stuck his head out of the window: Traffic was
rumbling along the main road ahead, but their street was empty.
“Okay,” he said.
Ron pressed a tiny silver button on the dashboard. The car around them
vanished — and so did they. Harry could feel the seat vibrating beneath him,
hear the engine, feel his hands on his knees and his glasses on his nose, but
for all he could see, he had become a pair of eyeballs, floating a few feet
above the ground in a dingy street full of parked cars.
“Let’s go,” said Ron’s voi  back to us.”
They looked around. People were still watching them, mainly because of
Hedwig’s continuing screeches.
“I think we’d better go and wait by the car,” said Harry. “We’re attracting
too much atten —”
“Harry!” said Ron, his eyes gleaming. “The car!”
“What about it?”
“We can fly the car to Hogwarts!”
“But I thought —”
“We’re stuck, right? And we’ve got to get to school, haven’t we? And even
underage wizards are allowed to use magic if it’s a real emergency, section
nineteen or something of the Restriction of Thingy —”
“But your mum and dad . . .” said Harry, pushing against the barrier again
in the vain hope that it would give way. “How will they get home?”
“They don’t need the car!” said Ron impatiently. “They know how toApparate! You know, just vanish and reappear at home! They only bother
with Floo powder and the car because we’re all underage and we’re not
allowed to Apparate yet. . . .”
Harry’s feeling of panic turned suddenly to excitement.
“Can you fly it?”
“No problem,” said Ron, wheeling his  iction of Thingy —”

What is the name of the house elf who serves the Malfoy family?,Dobby,"According to the text, the house-elf who serves the Malfoy family is Kreacher."," Malfoy made Dudley Dursley look like a kind,
thoughtful, and sensitive boy.
“I don’t know whether the Malfoys own a house-elf. . . .” said Harry.
“Well, whoever owns him will be an old Wizarding family, and they’ll be
rich,” said Fred.
“Yeah, Mum’s always wishing we had a house-elf to do the ironing,” said
George. “But all we’ve got is a lousy old ghoul in the attic and gnomes all
over the garden. House-elves come with big old manors and castles and
places like that; you wouldn’t catch one in our house. . . .”Harry was silent. Judging by the fact that Draco Malfoy usually had the
best of everything, his family was rolling in wizard gold; he could just see
Malfoy strutting around a large manor house. Sending the family servant to
stop Harry from going back to Hogwarts also sounded exactly like the sort of
thing Malfoy would do. Had Harry been stupid to take Dobby seriously?
“I’m glad we came to get you, anyway,” said Ron. “I was getting really
worried when you didn’t answer any of my letters. I thought it was r
to a house-elf!”
“Yeah, we don’t need to hear about you being in love with Malfoy,” Harry
told Kreacher. “Let’s fast forward to where he’s actually been going.”
Kreacher bowed again, looking furious, and then said, “Master Malfoy eats
in the Great Hall, he sleeps in a dormitory in the dungeons, he attends his
classes in a variety of —”
“Dobby, you tell me,” said Harry, cutting across Kreacher. “Has he been
going anywhere he shouldn’t have?”
“Harry Potter, sir,” squeaked Dobby, his great orblike eyes shining in the
firelight, “the Malfoy boy is breaking no rules that Dobby can discover, but
he is still keen to avoid detection. He has been making regular visits to the
seventh floor with a variety of other students, who keep watch for him while
he enters —”“The Room of Requirement!” said Harry, smacking himself hard on the
forehead with 
Advanced Potion-Making.
 Hermione and Ron stared at him.

“Must be, it’s not a very common name, is it?” said Harry. “Why?”
“I’ve heard Dad talking about him,” said George. “He was a big supporter
of You-Know-Who.”
“And when You-Know-Who disappeared,” said Fred, craning around to
look at Harry, “Lucius Malfoy came back saying he’d never meant any of it.
Load of dung — Dad reckons he was right in You-Know-Who’s inner circle.”
Harry had heard these rumors about Malfoy’s family before, and they
didn’t surprise him at all. Malfoy made Dudley Dursley look like a kind,
thoughtful, and sensitive boy.
“I don’t know whether the Malfoys own a house-elf. . . .” said Harry.
“Well, whoever owns him will be an old Wizarding family, and they’ll be

“— murderer,” spat Harry.
“Well . . . yes,” said Hermione. “So . . . I was sort of right. Snape must have
been proud of being ‘half a Prince,’ you see? Tobias Snape was a Muggle
from what it said in the 
Prophet.
”
“Yeah, that fits,” said Harry. “He’d play up the pure-blood side so he could
get in with Lucius Malfoy and the rest of them. . . . He’s just like Voldemort.

make himself feared using the Dark Arts, gave himself an impressive new
name —

have missed — ?”
He broke off, looking out the window. He could not stop himself dwelling
upon Dumbledore’s inexcusable trust in Snape . . . but as Hermione had just
inadvertently reminded him, he, Harry, had been taken in just the same. . . . Inspite of the increasing nastiness of those scribbled spells, he had refused to
believe ill of the boy who had been so clever, who had helped him so
much. . . .
Helped him  If, say, her father wasa wizard whose surname was Prince, and her mother was a Muggle, then that
would make her a ‘half-blood Prince’!”
“Yeah, very ingenious, Hermione . . .”
“But it would! Maybe she was proud of being half a Prince!”
“Listen, Hermione, I can tell it’s not a girl. I can just tell.”
“The truth is that you don’t think a girl would have been clever enough,”
said Hermione angrily.
“How can I have hung round with you for five years and not think girls are
clever?” said Harry, stung by this. “It’s the way he writes, I just know the
Prince was a bloke, I can tell. This girl hasn’t got anything to do with it.
Where did you get this anyway?”
“The library,” said Hermione predictably. “There’s a whole collection of
old 
Prophets
 up there. Well, I’m going to find out more about Eileen Prince if
I can.”
“Enjoy yourself,” said Harry irritably.
“I will,” said Hermione. “And the first place I’ll look,” she shot at him, as
she reached the portrait hole, “is records of old Potions awards!”
Harry scowled afte rewolves deserve blood, that we ought to
revenge ourselves on normal people.”
“But you are normal!” said Harry fiercely. “You’ve just got a — a problem

Lupin burst out laughing. “Sometimes you remind me a lot of James. He
called it my ‘furry little problem’ in company. Many people were under the
impression that I owned a badly behaved rabbit.”
He accepted a glass of eggnog from Mr. Weasley with a word of thanks,
looking slightly more cheerful. Harry, meanwhile, felt a rush of excitement:
This last mention of his father had reminded him that there was something he
had been looking forward to asking Lupin.
“Have you ever heard of someone called the Half-Blood Prince?”
“The Half-Blood what?”
“Prince,” said Harry, watching him closely for signs of recognition.
“There are no Wizarding princes,” said Lupin, now smiling. “Is this a title
you’re thinking of adopting? I should have thought being ‘the Chosen One’
would be enough.”
“It’s nothing to do with me!” said Harry indignantly. “The Half-Blood

but very pleased.

said, throwing a rune dictionary back to Hermione, so he could try again,
“threaten me with a dragon. Right . . .” He raised his wand once more. 
“Accio
Dictionary!”
The heavy book soared out of Hermione’s hand, flew across the room, and
Harry caught it.
“Harry, I really think you’ve got it!” said Hermione delightedly.
“Just as long as it works tomorrow,” Harry said. “The Firebolt’s going to be
much farther away than the stuff in here, it’s going to be in the castle, and I’m
going to be out there on the grounds. . . .”
“That doesn’t matter,” said Hermione firmly. “Just as long as you’re
concentrating really, really hard on it, it’ll come. Harry, we’d better get some
sleep . . . you’re going to need it.”
Harry had been focusing so hard on learning the Summoning Charm that
evening that some of his blind panic had left him. It retu n you, Harry,
that the charm might be too advanced for you. Many qualified wizards have
difficulty with it.”
“What does a Patronus look like?” said Harry curiously.
“Each one is unique to the wizard who conjures it.”
“And how do you conjure it?”“With an incantation, which will work only if you are concentrating, with
all your might, on a single, very happy memory.”
Harry cast his mind about for a happy memory. Certainly, nothing that had
happened to him at the Dursleys’ was going to do. Finally, he settled on the
moment when he had first ridden a broomstick.
“Right,” he said, trying to recall as exactly as possible the wonderful,
soaring sensation of his stomach.
“The incantation is this —” Lupin cleared his throat. 
“Expecto Patronum!”
“Expecto Patronum,” 
Harry repeated under his breath, 
“Expecto
Patronum.”
“Concentrating hard on your happy memory?”
“Oh — yeah —” said Harry, quickly forcing his thoughts back to that first
broom ride. 
“Expecto Patrono
 — no, 
Patronum
 — sorry — 
Expecto
Patronum, Expecto  ion, it isagainst nature.”
“But how do you do it?”
“By an act of evil — the supreme act of evil. By committing murder.
Killing rips the soul apart. The wizard intent upon creating a Horcrux would
use the damage to his advantage: He would encase the torn portion —”
“Encase? But how — ?”
“There is a spell, do not ask me, I don’t know!” said Slughorn, shaking his
head like an old elephant bothered by mosquitoes. “Do I look as though I
have tried it — do I look like a killer?”
“No, sir, of course not,” said Riddle quickly. “I’m sorry . . . I didn’t mean to
offend . . .”
“Not at all, not at all, not offended,” said Slughorn gruffly. “It’s natural to
feel some curiosity about these things. . . . Wizards of a certain caliber have
always been drawn to that aspect of magic. . . .”
“Yes, sir,” said Riddle. “What I don’t understand, though — just out of
curiosity — I mean, would one Horcrux be much use? Can you only split
your soul once? Wouldn’t it be better, make you stronger, to have your soul in
more pieces, I mean,"

There was a short silence in which many members of the class turned their
heads to frown at the three course aims still written on the blackboard.
“
Using
 defensive spells?” Professor Umbridge repeated with a little laugh.
“Why, I can’t imagine any situation arising in my classroom that would
require you to 
use
 a defensive spell, Miss Granger. You surely aren’t
expecting to be attacked during class?”
“We’re not going to use magic?” Ron ejaculated loudly.
“Students raise their hands when they wish to speak in my class, Mr. — ?”
“Weasley,” said Ron, thrusting his hand into the air.
Professor Umbridge, smiling still more widely, turned her back on him.
Harry and Hermione immediately raised their hands too. Professor
Umbridge’s pouchy eyes lingered on Harry for a moment before she
addressed Hermione.
“Yes, Miss Granger? You wanted to ask something else?”
“Yes,” said Hermione. “Surely the whole point of Defense Against the
Dark Arts is to practice defensive spells?”
“Are you a Minis he teaches?” said Ron, frowning at Professor Lupin’s pallid
profile.
“That’s obvious,” whispered Hermione. “There’s only one vacancy, isn’t
there? Defense Against the Dark Arts.”
Harry, Ron, and Hermione had already had two Defense Against the Dark
Arts teachers, both of whom had lasted only one year. There were rumors that
the job was jinxed.
“Well, I hope he’s up to it,” said Ron doubtfully. “He looks like one good
hex would finish him off, doesn’t he? Anyway . . .” He turned to Harry.
“What were you going to tell us?”
Harry explained all about Mr. and Mrs. Weasley’s argument and the
warning Mr. Weasley had just given him. When he’d finished, Ron looked
thunderstruck, and Hermione had her hands over her mouth. She finally
lowered them to say, “Sirius Black escaped to come after

“I don’t go looking for trouble,” said Harry, nettled. “Trouble usually finds

“How thick would Harry have to be, to go looki gainst the Dark Arts,” said
Hermione.
“Me?” said Harry, now grinning more broadly than ever. “No I’m not,
you’ve beaten me in every test —”
“Actually, I haven’t,” said Hermione coolly. “You beat me in our third year
— the only year we both sat the test and had a teacher who actually knew the
subject. But I’m not talking about test results, Harry. Look what you’ve
done

“How d’you mean?”
“You know what, I’m not sure I want someone this stupid teaching me,”
Ron said to Hermione, smirking slightly. He turned to Harry. “Let’s think,” he
said, pulling a face like Goyle concentrating. “Uh . . . first year — you saved
the Stone from You-Know-Who.”
“But that was luck,” said Harry, “that wasn’t skill —”
“Second year,” Ron interrupted, “you killed the basilisk and destroyed

“Yeah, but if Fawkes hadn’t turned up I —”

“Certainly. I have a special gift with trolls — you must have seen what I
did to the one in the chamber back there? Unfortunately, while everyone else
was running around looking for it, Snape, who already suspected me, went
straight to the third floor to head me off — and not only did my troll fail to
beat you to death, that three-headed dog didn’t even manage to bite Snape’s
leg off properly.
“Now, wait quietly, Potter. I need to examine this interesting mirror.”
It was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell. It
was the Mirror of Erised.
“This mirror is the key to finding the Stone,” Quirrell murmured, tapping
his way around the frame. “Trust Dumbledore to come up with something like
this . . . but he’s in London . . . I’ll be far away by the time he gets back. . . .”
All Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and stop him
from concentrating on the mirror.
“I saw you and Sna  said Ron finally. “If any dog needs exercise, that one does.”
Hermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again.
“You don’t use your eyes, any of you, do you?” she snapped. “Didn’t you
see what it was standing on?”
“The floor?” Harry suggested. “I wasn’t looking at its feet, I was too busy
with its heads.”
“No, 
not
 the floor. It was standing on a trapdoor. It’s obviously guardingsomething.”
She stood up, glaring at them.
“I hope you’re pleased with yourselves. We could all have been killed — or
worse, expelled. Now, if you don’t mind, I’m going to bed.”
Ron stared after her, his mouth open.
“No, we don’t mind,” he said. “You’d think we dragged her along,
wouldn’t you?”
But Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as he climbed
back into bed. The dog was guarding something. . . . What had Hagrid said?
Gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to hide
— except perhaps Hogwarts.
It looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby little package
from v ault seven hundred and thirteen was.M
 
CHAPTER  TEN
HALLOWEEN
alfoy couldn’t believe his eyes when he saw that Harry and Ron were
still at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful.
Indeed, by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the three-
headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were quite keen to have
another one. In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the package that
seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot
of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection.
“It’s either really valuable or really dangerous,” said Ron.
“Or both,” said Harry.
But as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was
about two inches long, they didn’t have much chance of guessing what it was
without further clues.
Neither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay
underneath the dog and the trapdoor. All Neville cared about was never going
near the dog again.
Hermione was now refusing to spea"
What creature is Aragog?,Acromantula,"Aragog is a giant spider, a Acromantula.","d with the light
spilling from Hagrid’s window to illuminate Aragog’s body lying on the edge
of a massive pit beside a ten-foot-high mound of freshly dug earth.
“Magnificent,” said Slughorn, approaching the spider’s head, where eight
milky eyes stared blankly at the sky and two huge, curved pincers shone,
motionless, in the moonlight. Harry thought he heard the tinkle of bottles as
Slughorn bent over the pincers, apparently examining the enormous hairy
head.
“It’s not ev’ryone appreciates how beau’iful they are,” said Hagrid to
Slughorn’s back, tears leaking from the corners of his crinkled eyes. “I didn’
know yeh were int’rested in creatures like Aragog, Horace.”
“Interested? My dear Hagrid, I revere them,” said Slughorn, stepping back
from the body. Harry saw the glint of a bottle disappear beneath his cloak,
though Hagrid, mopping his eyes once more, noticed nothing. “Now . . . shall
we proceed to the burial?”
Hagrid nodded and moved forward. He heaved the gigantic spider into his
arms and, with an enormou oad.
Harry fell to the ground on all fours as the spider released him. Ron and
Fang thudded down next to him. Fang wasn’t howling anymore, but cowering
silently on the spot. Ron looked exactly like Harry felt. His mouth was
stretched wide in a kind of silent scream and his eyes were popping.
Harry suddenly realized that the spider that had dropped him was saying
something. It had been hard to tell, because he clicked his pincers with every
word he spoke.
“Aragog!” it called. “Aragog!”
And from the middle of the misty, domed web, a spider the size of a small
elephant emerged, very slowly. There was gray in the black of his body and
legs, and each of the eyes on his ugly, pincered head was milky white. He was
blind.
“What is it?” he said, clicking his pincers rapidly.
“Men,” clicked the spider who had caught Harry.
“Is it Hagrid?” said Aragog, moving closer, his eight milky eyes wandering
vaguely.
“Strangers,” clicked the spider who had brought Ron.
“Kill them,” clicked Aragog fretfully. “I was sleeping. . . .” pes shifted all around him.
“The thing that lives in the castle,” said Aragog, “is an ancient creature we
spiders fear above all others. Well do I remember how I pleaded with Hagrid
to let me go, when I sensed the beast moving about the school.”
“What is it?” said Harry urgently.
More loud clicking, more rustling; the spiders seemed to be closing in.
“We do not speak of it!” said Aragog fiercely. “We do not name it! I never
even told Hagrid the name of that dread creature, though he asked me, many
times.”
Harry didn’t want to press the subject, not with the spiders pressing closer
on all sides. Aragog seemed to be tired of talking. He was backing slowly into
his domed web, but his fellow spiders continued to inch slowly toward Harry
and Ron.
“We’ll just go, then,” Harry called desperately to Aragog, hearing leaves
rustling behind him.
“Go?” said Aragog slowly. “I think not. . . .”
“But — but —”
“My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid, on my command. But I
cannot deny them fresh meat, when it wanders so will"
Who does Harry marry?,Ginny Weasley,"According to the context, Harry is not married yet, but he is talking about marrying Ginny Weasley.","at he really is going to marry
her,” sighed Ginny later that evening, as she, Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat
beside the open window of the Gryffindor common room, looking out over
the twilit grounds.
“She’s not that bad,” said Harry. “Ugly, though,” he added hastily, as Ginny
raised her eyebrows, and she let out a reluctant giggle.
“Well, I suppose if Mum can stand it, I can.”
“Anyone else we know died?” Ron asked Hermione, who was perusing the
Evening Prophet.
Hermione winced at the forced toughness in his voice. “No,” she said
reprovingly, folding up the newspaper. “They’re still looking for Snape but no
sign . . .”
“Of course there isn’t,” said Harry, who became angry every time this
subject cropped up. “They won’t find Snape till they find Voldemort, and
seeing as they’ve never managed to do that in all this time . . .”“I’m going to go to bed,” yawned Ginny. “I haven’t been sleeping that well
since . . . well . . . I could do with some sleep.”
She kissed Harry (Ron looked away pointedly), waved at the other from the spot.
Behind Harry, the entrance to the marquee revealed rows and rows of
fragile golden chairs set on either side of a long purple carpet. The supporting
poles were entwined with white and gold flowers. Fred and George had
fastened an enormous bunch of golden balloons over the exact point where
Bill and Fleur would shortly become husband and wife. Outside, butterflies
and bees were hovering lazily over the grass and hedgerow. Harry was rather
uncomfortable. The Muggle boy whose appearance he was affecting wasslightly fatter than him, and his dress robes felt hot and tight in the full glare
of a summer’s day.
“When I get married,” said Fred, tugging at the collar of his own robes, “I
won’t be bothering with any of this nonsense. You can all wear what you like,
and I’ll put a full Body-Bind Curse on Mum until it’s all over.”
“She wasn’t too bad this morning, considering,” said George. “Cried a bit
about Percy not being here, but who wants him? Oh blimey, brace yourselves
— here they come, look.”
Brigh ing to be married!”“Oh,” said Harry blankly. He could not help noticing how Mrs. Weasley,
Hermione, and Ginny were all determinedly avoiding one another’s gaze.
“Wow. Er — congratulations!”
She swooped down upon him and kissed him again.
“Bill is very busy at ze moment, working very ’ard, and I only work part-
time at Gringotts for my Eenglish, so he brought me ’ere for a few days to get
to know ’is family properly. I was so pleased to ’ear you would be coming —
zere isn’t much to do ’ere, unless you like cooking and chickens! Well —
enjoy your breakfast, ’Arry!”
With these words she turned gracefully and seemed to float out of the
room, closing the door quietly behind her.
Mrs. Weasley made a noise that sounded like “tchah!”
“Mum hates her,” said Ginny quietly.
“I do not hate her!” said Mrs. Weasley in a cross whisper. “I just think
they’ve hurried into this engagement, that’s all!”
“They’ve known each other a year,” said Ron, who looked oddly groggy
and was staring at the closed door.

son, Dudley, were Harry’s only living relatives. They were Muggles, and they
had a very medieval attitude toward magic. Harry’s dead parents, who had
been a witch and wizard themselves, were never mentioned under the
Dursleys’ roof. For years, Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon had hoped that if
they kept Harry as downtrodden as possible, they would be able to squash the
magic out of him. To their fury, they had been unsuccessful. These days they
lived in terror of anyone finding out that Harry had spent most of the last two
years at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The most they could
do, however, was to lock away Harry’s spellbooks, wand, cauldron, and
broomstick at the start of the summer break, and forbid him to talk to the
neighbors.
This separation from his spellbooks had been a real problem for Harry,
because his teachers at Hogwarts had given him a lot of holiday work. One of
the essays, a particularly nasty one about shrinking potions, was for Harry’  STATUS:

“Undesirable Number One,” Harry muttered under his breath as he
replaced Mr. Weasley’s folder and shut the drawer. He had an idea he knew
who that was, and sure enough, as he straightened up and glanced around the
office for fresh hiding places, he saw a poster of himself on the wall, with the
words 
UNDESIRABLE NO. 1
 emblazoned across his chest. A little pink note was
stuck to it with a picture of a kitten in the corner. Harry moved across to read
it and saw that Umbridge had written, 
“To be punished.”
Angrier than ever, he proceeded to grope in the bottoms of the vases and
baskets of dried flowers, b and ends up
setting fire to his bed.”
“I think he’s brilliant,” said Harry coldly.
“
Do
 you?” said the boy, with a slight sneer. “Why is he with you? Where
are your parents?”
“They’re dead,” said Harry shortly. He didn’t feel much like going into the
matter with this boy.
“Oh, sorry,” said the other, not sounding sorry at all. “But they were 
ourkind, weren’t they?”
“They were a witch and wizard, if that’s what you mean.”
“I really don’t think they should let the other sort in, do you? They’re just
not the same, they’ve never been brought up to know our ways. Some of them
have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine. I think
they should keep it in the old wizarding families. What’s your surname,
anyway?”
But before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, “That’s you done, my
dear,” and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped
down from the footstool.
“Well, I’ll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,” said the drawling boy.

Wizarding shops in the world, Harry felt no desire to break his word to Fudge
and stray back into the Muggle world.
Harry ate breakfast each morning in the Leaky Cauldron, where he liked
watching the other guests: funny little witches from the country, up for a day’s
shopping; venerable-looking wizards arguing over the latest article in
Transfiguration Today
; wild-looking warlocks; raucous dwarfs; and once,
what looked suspiciously like a hag, who ordered a plate of raw liver from
behind a thick woollen balaclava.
After breakfast Harry would go out into the backyard, take out his wand,
tap the third brick from the left above the trash bin, and stand back as the
archway into Diagon Alley opened in the wall.
Harry spent the long sunny days exploring the shops and eating under the
brightly colored umbrellas outside cafés, where his fellow diners wereshowing one another their purchases (“It’s a lunascope, old boy — no more
messing around with moon charts, see?”) or else discussing the case of Si anced at
Hermione and drew back into the shadows.
“Madam Lestrange,” murmured Tom, and as Hermione passed he inclined
his head subserviently.
“Good morning,” said Hermione, and as Harry crept past, still carrying
Griphook piggyback under the Cloak, he saw Tom look surprised.
“Too polite,” Harry whispered in Hermione’s ear as they passed out of the
inn into the tiny backyard. “You need to treat people like they’re scum!”“Okay, okay!”
Hermione drew out Bellatrix’s wand and tapped a brick in the nondescript
wall in front of them. At once the bricks began to whirl and spin: A hole
appeared in the middle of them, which grew wider and wider, finally forming
an archway onto the narrow cobbled street that was Diagon Alley.
It was quiet, barely time for the shops to open, and there were hardly any
shoppers abroad. The crooked, cobbled street was much altered now from the
bustling place Harry had visited before his first term at Hogwarts so many
years before. More shops than ever were boarded up, though several new

Diagon Alley had changed. The colorful, glittering window displays of
spellbooks, potion ingredients, and cauldrons were lost to view, hidden behind
the large Ministry of Magic posters that had been pasted over them. Most of
these somber purple posters carried blown-up versions of the security advice
on the Ministry pamphlets that had been sent out over the summer, but others
bore moving black-and-white photographs of Death Eaters known to be on
the loose. Bellatrix Lestrange was sneering from the front of the nearest
apothecary. A few windows were boarded up, including those of Florean
Fortescue’s Ice Cream Parlor. On the other hand, a number of shabby-looking
stalls had sprung up along the street. The nearest one, which had been erected
outside Flourish and Blotts, under a striped, stained awning, had a cardboard
sign pinned to its front:AMULETS

intended to do, I’m sure. . . .”
“Voldemort put a bit of himself in 
me
?” Harry said, thunderstruck.
“It certainly seems so.”
“So I 
should 
be in Slytherin,” Harry said, looking desperately into
Dumbledore’s face. “The Sorting Hat could see Slytherin’s power in me, and
it —”
“Put you in Gryffindor,” said Dumbledore calmly. “Listen to me, Harry.
You happen to have many qualities Salazar Slytherin prized in his hand-
picked students. His own very rare gift, Parseltongue — 
resourcefulness —
determination — 
a certain disregard for rules,” he added, his mustache
quivering again. “Yet the Sorting Hat placed you in Gryffindor. You know
why that was. Think.”
“It only put me in Gryffindor,” said Harry in a defeated voice, “because I
asked not to go in Slytherin. . . .”
“Exactly,”
 said Du  you are here, your House will be something like
your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your
House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free time in your House

“The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and
Slytherin. Each House has its own noble history and each has produced
outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs
will earn your House points, while any rule-breaking will lose House points.
At the end of the year, the House with the most points is awarded the House
Cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever House
becomes yours.
“The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest
of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can
while you are waiting.”
Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville’s cloak, which was fastened
under his left ear, and on Ron’s smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to
flatten his hair.

“You all know, of course, that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years
ago — the precise date is uncertain — by the four greatest witches and
wizards of the age. The four school Houses are named after them: Godric
Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin.
They built this castle together, far from prying Muggle eyes, for it was an age
when magic was feared by common people, and witches and wizards suffered
much persecution.”
He paused, gazed blearily around the room, and continued.
“For a few years, the founders worked in harmony together, seeking out
youngsters who showed signs of magic and bringing them to the castle to be
educated. But then disagreements sprang up between them. A rift began to
grow between Slytherin and the others. Slytherin wished to be more 
selective
about the students admitted to Hogwarts. He believed that magical learning
should be kept within all-magic families. He disliked taking students ofMuggle parentage, believing them to be untrustworthy. Afte"

drops were leaping like goldfish above the surface, though not a particle had
spilled.

forgotten the potion at all, but had waited to be asked for dramatic effect.
“Yes. That. Well,

potion called Felix Felicis. I take it,” he turned, smiling, to look at Hermione,
who had let out an audible gasp, “that you know what Felix Felicis does, Miss
Granger?”
“It’s liquid luck,” said Hermione excitedly. “It makes you lucky!”
The whole class seemed to sit up a little straighter. Now all Harry could see
of Malfoy was the back of his sleek blond head, because he was at last giving
Slughorn his full and undivided attention.

would take the Marauder’s Map, which, next to the Cloak, was the most
useful aid to rule-breaking Harry owned. The map showed the whole of

It was a map showing every detail of the Hogwarts castle and grounds. But
the truly remarkable thing were the tiny ink dots moving around it, each
labeled with a name in minuscule writing. Astounded, Harry bent over it. A
labeled dot in the top left corner showed that Professor Dumbledore was
pacing his study; the caretaker’s cat, Mrs. Norris, was prowling the second
floor; and Peeves the Poltergeist was currently bouncing around the trophy
room. And as Harry’s eyes traveled up and down the familiar corridors, he
noticed something else.
This map showed a set of passages he had never entered. And many of
them seemed to lead —
“Right into Hogsmeade,” said Fred, tracing one of them with his finger.
“There are seven in all. Now, Filch knows about these four” — he pointed
them out — “but we’re sure we’re the only ones who know about

“Like what?” said Moody sharply.
Harry wondered how much he dare say. He didn’t want Moody to guess
that he had a source of information outside Hogwarts; that might lead to
tricky questions about Sirius.
“I don’t know,” Harry muttered, “odd stuff’s been happening lately, hasn’t

Both of Moody’s mismatched eyes widened.

Marauder’s Map. “Crouch could be thinking along those lines,” he said
slowly. “Very possible . . . there have been some funny rumors flying around

Who is the Triwizard champion from Beauxbatons?,Fleur Delacour,The Triwizard champion from Beauxbatons is not mentioned in this passage.,"oke. Nearly everyone laughed, and Dumbledore chuckled appreciatively.
“I am 
not
 joking, Mr. Weasley,” he said, “though now that you mention it, I
did hear an excellent one over the summer about a troll, a hag, and a
leprechaun who all go into a bar . . .”
Professor McGonagall cleared her throat loudly.
“Er — but maybe this is not the time . . . no . . .” said Dumbledore, “where
was I? Ah yes, the Triwizard Tournament . . . well, some of you will not know
what this tournament involves, so I hope those who 
do
 know will forgive me
for giving a short explanation, and allow their attention to wander freely.
“The Triwizard Tournament was first established some seven hundred years
ago as a friendly competition between the three largest European schools of
wizardry: Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, and Durmstrang. A champion was selected
to represent each school, and the three champions competed in three magical
tasks. The schools took it in turns to host the tournament once every five
years, and it was generally agreed to ds of years ago.
“There have been several attempts over the centuries to reinstate the
tournament,” Dumbledore continued, “none of which has been very
successful. However, our own Departments of International Magical
Cooperation and Magical Games and Sports have decided the time is ripe for
another attempt. We have worked hard over the summer to ensure that this
time, no champion will find himself or herself in mortal danger.
“The Heads of Beauxbatons and Durmstrang will be arriving with their
shortlisted contenders in October, and the selection of the three champions
will take place at Halloween. An impartial judge will decide which students
are most worthy to compete for the Triwizard Cup, the glory of their school,
and a thousand Galleons personal prize money.”
“I’m going for it!” Fred Weasley hissed down the table, his face lit with
enthusiasm at the prospect of such glory and riches. He was not the only
person who seemed to be visualizing himself as the Hogwarts champion. At
every House table, Harry coul  red, luminous stars on their hats, all
except Hagrid, who had his on the back of his moleskin vest.
“We are going to be patrolling the outside of the maze,” said Professor
McGonagall to the champions. “If you get into difficulty, and wish to be
rescued, send red sparks into the air, and one of us will come and get you, do
you understand?”
The champions nodded.
“Off you go, then!” said Bagman brightly to the four patrollers.
“Good luck, Harry,” Hagrid whispered, and the four of them walked awayin different directions, to station themselves around the maze. Bagman now
pointed his wand at his throat, muttered, 
“Sonorus,”
 and his magically
magnified voice echoed into the stands.

Salazar Slytherin himself, through my mother’s side? I, keep the name of a
foul, common Muggle, who abandoned me even before I was born, just
because he found out his wife was a witch? No, Harry — I fashioned myself a
new name, a name I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak,when I had become the greatest sorcerer in the world!”
Harry’s brain seemed to have jammed. He stared numbly at Riddle, at the
orphaned boy who had grown up to murder Harry’s own parents, and so many
others. . . . At last he forced himself to speak.
“You’re not,” he said, his quiet voice full of hatred.
“Not what?” snapped Riddle.

He broke off, looking out the window. He could not stop himself dwelling
upon Dumbledore’s inexcusable trust in Snape . . . but as Hermione had just
inadvertently reminded him, he, Harry, had been taken in just the same. . . . Inspite of the increasing nastiness of those scribbled spells, he had refused to
believe ill of the boy who had been so clever, who had helped him so
much. . . .

didn’t really need Legilimency. . . . He might even have known before then,
with Slughorn talking about how brilliant I was at Potions. . . . Shouldn’t have
left his old book in the bottom of that cupboard, should he?”
“But why didn’t he turn you in?”
“I don’t  eleven years I have

Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two
lemon drops, seemed not to notice. “It all gets so confusing if we keep saying
‘You-Know-Who.’ I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying
Voldemort’s name.”
“I know you haven’t,” said Professor McGonagall, sounding half
exasperated, half admiring. “But you’re different. Everyone knows you’re the
only one You-Know- oh, all right,

“You flatter me,” said Dumbledore calmly. “Voldemort had powers I will
never have.”
“Only because you’re too — well — 
noble
 to use them.”
“It’s lucky it’s dark. I haven’t blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told
me she liked my new earmuffs.”
Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said, “The

“The thing is,” whispered Hermione through the dark, “we could have
achieved that with Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder.”
There was a small 
click,
 and the ball of light from the lamp flew back to the
ceiling and illuminated them all once more.
“Still, it’s cool,” said Ron, a little defensively. “And from what they said,
Dumbledore invented it himself!”
“I know, but surely he wouldn’t have singled you out in his will just to help
us turn out the lights!”“D’you think he knew the Ministry would confiscate his will and examine
everything he’d left us?” asked Harry.
“Definitely,” said Hermione. “He couldn’t tell us in the will why he was
leaving us these things, but that still doesn’t explain . . .”
“. . . why he couldn’t have given us a hint when he was alive?” asked Ron.
“Well, exactly,” said Hermione, now flicking through

An eerie sight met their eyes: They were standing on the edge of a great
black lake, so vast that Harry could not make out the distant banks, in a
cavern so high that the ceiling too was out of sight. A misty greenish light
shone far away in what looked like the middle of the lake; it was reflected in
the completely still water below. The greenish glow and the light from the
two wands were the only things that broke the otherwise velvety blackness,
though their rays did not penetrate as far as Harry would have expected. The
darkness was somehow denser than normal darkness.
“Let us walk,” said Dumbledore quietly. “Be very careful not to step into
the water. Stay close to me.”
He set off around the edge of the lake, and Harry followed close behind
him. Their footsteps made echoing, slapping sounds on the narrow rim of
rock that surrounded the water. On and on they walked, but the view did notvary: on one side of them, the rough cavern wall, on the other, the boundless
 eyes furious, fixed . . .and slowly, very slowly, the beads quivered to a halt, and then, just as slowly,
they began to move the other way . . . and it was Voldemort’s wand that was

fearful. . . .
One of the beads of light was quivering, inches from the tip of Voldemort’s
wand. Harry didn’t understand why he was doing it, didn’t know what it
might achieve . . . but he now concentrated as he had never done in his life on
forcing that bead of light right back into Voldemort’s wand . . . and slowly . . .

What is the name of Hermione's cat?,Crookshanks,The name of Hermione's cat is Crookshanks.," Harry. The cat’s ginger fur was thick
and fluffy, but it was definitely a bit bowlegged and its face looked grumpy
and oddly squashed, as though it had run headlong into a brick wall. Now that
Scabbers was out of sight, however, the cat was purring contentedly in
Hermione’s arms.
“Hermione, that thing nearly scalped me!” said Ron.
“He didn’t mean to, did you, Crookshanks?” said Hermione.
“And what about Scabbers?” said Ron, pointing at the lump in his chest
pocket. “He needs rest and relaxation! How’s he going to get it with that thing
around?”
“That reminds me, you forgot your rat tonic,” said Hermione, slapping the
small red bottle into Ron’s hand. “And stop 
worrying,
 Crookshanks will be
sleeping in my dormitory and Scabbers in yours, what’s the problem? Poor
Crookshanks, that witch said he’d been in there for ages; no one wanted him.”
“I wonder why,” said Ron sarcastically as they set off toward the Leaky
Cauldron.
They found Mr. Weasley sitting in the bar, reading the 
Daily Prophet
.“Harry!” he said,  ssaging his head.
“What 
was
 that?”
“It was either a very big cat or quite a small tiger,” said Harry.
“Where’s Hermione?”
“Probably getting her owl —”
They made their way back up the crowded street to the Magical Menagerie.
As they reached it, Hermione came out, but she wasn’t carrying an owl. Her
arms were clamped tightly around the enormous ginger cat.
“You 
bought
 that monster?” said Ron, his mouth hanging open.
“He’s 
gorgeous,
 isn’t he?” said Hermione, glowing.
That was a matter of opinion, thought Harry. The cat’s ginger fur was thick
and fluffy, but it was definitely a bit bowlegged and its face looked grumpy
and oddly squashed, as though it had run headlong into a brick wall. Now that
Scabbers was out of sight, however, the cat was purring contentedly in

instantly as a gnome. Barely ten inches high, its horny little feet pattered very
fast as it sprinted across the yard and dived headlong into one of the
Wellington boots that lay scattered around the door. Harry could hear the
gnome giggling madly as Crookshanks inserted a paw into the boot, trying to
reach it. Meanwhile, a very loud crashing noise was coming from the other
side of the house. The source of the commotion was revealed as they entered
the garden, and saw that Bill and Charlie both had their wands out, and were
making two battered old tables fly high above the lawn, smashing into each
other, each attempting to knock the other’s out of the air. Fred and George
were cheering, Ginny was laughing, and Hermione was hovering near the

“You needed Alastor Moody,” said Dumbledore. His blue eyes were
blazing, though his voice remained calm.
“Wormtail and I did it. We had prepared the Polyjuice Potion beforehand.
We journeyed to his house. Moody put up a struggle. There was a commotion.
We managed to subdue him just in time. Forced him into a compartment of
his own magical trunk. Took some of his hair and added it to the potion. I
drank it; I became Moody’s double. I took his leg and his eye. I was ready to
face Arthur Weasley when he arrived to sort out the Muggles who had heard a
disturbance. I made the dustbins move around the yard. I told Arthur Weasley
I had heard intruders in my yard, who had set off the dustbins. Then I packed
up Moody’s clothes and Dark Detectors, put them in as though he were trapped
in a nightmare. He was fully aware that even if, by some miracle, he managed
to find a suitable spell, he’d have a real job mastering it overnight. How could
he have let this happen? Why hadn’t he got to work on the egg’s clue sooner?
Why had he ever let his mind wander in class — what if a teacher had once
mentioned how to breathe underwater?
He sat with Hermione and Ron in the library as the sun set outside, tearing
feverishly through page after page of spells, hidden from one another by the
massive piles of books on the desk in front of each of them. Harry’s heart
gave a huge leap every time he saw the word “water” on a page, but more
often than not it was merely “Take two pints of water, half a pound of
shredded mandrake leaves, and a newt . . .”
“I don’t reckon it can be done,” said Ron’s voice flatly from the other side
of the table. “There’s nothing. 
Nothing.
 Closest was that thing to dry up
puddles and ponds, that Drought Charm, but that was nowhere near powerful
enough to   magical power. The part of him that
was still dry was covered in goose pimples; half immersed in the icy water, a
cruel breeze lifting his hair, Harry started to shiver violently. He avoided
looking at the stands; the laughter was becoming louder, and there were
catcalls and jeering from the Slytherins. . . .
Then, quite suddenly, Harry felt as though an invisible pillow had been
pressed over his mouth and nose. He tried to draw breath, but it made his head
spin; his lungs were empty, and he suddenly felt a piercing pain on either side
of his neck —
Harry clapped his hands around his throat and felt two large slits just below
his ears, flapping in the cold air. . . . 
He had gills.
 Without pausing to think, he
did the only thing that made sense — he flung himself forward into the water.The first gulp of icy lake water felt like the breath of life. His head had
stopped spinning; he took another great gulp of water and felt it pass
smoothly through his gills, sending oxygen back to his brain. He stretched out"
Who killed Dumbledore?,Severus Snape,I do not know who killed Dumbledore. The passage you provided does not mention Dumbledore's death.,"waited, but Dumbledore did not speak.
“I still don’t understand.”
“Voldemort tried to kill you when you were a child because of a prophecy
made shortly before your birth. He knew the prophecy had been made, though
he did not know its full contents. He set out to kill you when you were still a
baby, believing he was fulfilling the terms of the prophecy. He discovered, to
his cost, that he was mistaken, when the curse intended to kill you backfired.
And so, since his return to his body, and particularly since your extraordinary
escape from him last year, he has been determined to hear that prophecy in its
entirety. This is the weapon he has been seeking so assiduously since his
return: the knowledge of how to destroy you.”
The sun had risen fully now. Dumbledore’s office was bathed in it. The
glass case in which the sword of Godric Gryffindor resided gleamed white
and opaque, the fragments of the instruments Harry had thrown to the floor
glistened like raindrops, and behind him, the baby Fawkes made soft
chirru perhaps looking for
another body to share . . . not being truly alive, he cannot be killed. He left
Quirrell to die; he shows just as little mercy to his followers as his enemies.
Nevertheless, Harry, while you may only have delayed his return to power, it
will merely take someone else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing
battle next time — and if he is delayed again, and again, why, he may never
return to power.”
Harry nodded, but stopped quickly, because it made his head hurt. Then he
said, “Sir, there are some other things I’d like to know, if you can tell me . . .
things I want to know the truth about. . . .”
“The truth.” Dumbledore sighed. “It is a beautiful and terrible thing, and
should therefore be treated with great caution. However, I shall answer your
questions unless I have a very good reason not to, in which case I beg you’llforgive me. I shall not, of course, lie.”
“Well . . . Voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried to
stop him from killing me. But why would he wan , Harry. But — he couldn’t. He
couldn’t kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how, but they’re saying that
when he couldn’t kill Harry Potter, Voldemort’s power somehow broke —
and that’s why he’s gone.”
Dumbledore nodded glumly.
“It’s — it’s 
true
?” faltered Professor McGonagall. “After all he’s done . . .
all the people he’s killed . . . he couldn’t kill a little boy? It’s just
astounding . . . of all the things to stop him . . . but how in the name of heaven
did Harry survive?”
“We can only guess,” said Dumbledore. “We may never know.”
Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her
eyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a
golden watch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very odd watch. It had
twelve hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving around the
edge. It must have made sense to Dumbledore, though, because he put it back
in his pocket and said, “Hagrid’s late. I suppose it was he who told you I’d be
here, by the way?”

What shape is Harry's scar?,A lightning bolt,The shape of Harry's scar is lightning-shaped.,"steadily toward them between the graves. Harry couldn’t
make out a face, but from the way it was walking and holding its arms, he
could tell that it was carrying something. Whoever it was, he was short, and
wearing a hooded cloak pulled up over his head to obscure his face. And —
several paces nearer, the gap between them closing all the time — Harry saw
that the thing in the person’s arms looked like a baby . . . or was it merely a
bundle of robes?
Harry lowered his wand slightly and glanced sideways at Cedric. Cedric
shot him a quizzical look. They both turned back to watch the approaching
figure.
It stopped beside a towering marble headstone, only six feet from them. For
a second, Harry and Cedric and the short figure simply looked at one another.
And then, without warning, Harry’s scar exploded with pain. It was agony
such as he had never felt in all his life; his wand slipped from his fingers as he
put his hands over his face; his knees buckled; he was on the ground and he
could see nothing at all; his h arding world.
Harry looked nothing like the rest of the family. Uncle Vernon was large
and neckless, with an enormous black mustache; Aunt Petunia was horse-
faced and bony; Dudley was blond, pink, and porky. Harry, on the other hand,
was small and skinny, with brilliant green eyes and jet-black hair that was
always untidy. He wore round glasses, and on his forehead was a thin,
lightning-shaped scar.
It was this scar that made Harry so particularly unusual, even for a wizard.
This scar was the only hint of Harry’s very mysterious past, of the reason he
had been left on the Dursleys’ doorstep eleven years before.
At the age of one year old, Harry had somehow survived a curse from the
greatest Dark sorcerer of all time, Lord Voldemort, whose name most witches
and wizards still feared to speak. Harry’s parents had died in Voldemort’sattack, but Harry had escaped with his lightning scar, and somehow —
nobody understood why — Voldemort’s powers had been destroyed the
instant he had failed to kill Harry.
So Harry h e lightning scar on Harry’s forehead with a long,
white finger.
“I’m sorry to say I sold the wand that did it,” he said softly. “Thirteen-and-
a-half inches. Yew. Powerful wand, very powerful, and in the wrong
hands . . . well, if I’d known what that wand was going out into the world to
do. . . .”
He shook his head and then, to Harry’s relief, spotted Hagrid.
“Rubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you again. . . . Oak, sixteen
inches, rather bendy, wasn’t it?”
“It was, sir, yes,” said Hagrid.“Good wand, that one. But I suppose they snapped it in half when you got
expelled?” said Mr. Ollivander, suddenly stern.
“Er — yes, they did, yes,” said Hagrid, shuffling his feet. “I’ve still got the
pieces, though,” he added brightly.
“But you don’t use them?” said Mr. Ollivander sharply.
“Oh, no, sir,” said Hagrid quickly. Harry noticed he gripped his pink
umbrella very tightly as he spoke.
“Hmmm,” said Mr. Ollivander, giving Hagrid a piercing look. “Well, now
— Mr. Potter. Let me see.” He pulled a long tape measure w"
Who are Harry's parents?,James and Lily Potter,"According to the provided context, Harry's parents were a witch and a wizard themselves.","idays. Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and their
son, Dudley, were Harry’s only living relatives. They were Muggles, and they
had a very medieval attitude toward magic. Harry’s dead parents, who had
been a witch and wizard themselves, were never mentioned under the
Dursleys’ roof. For years, Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon had hoped that if
they kept Harry as downtrodden as possible, they would be able to squash the
magic out of him. To their fury, they had been unsuccessful. These days they
lived in terror of anyone finding out that Harry had spent most of the last two
years at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The most they could
do, however, was to lock away Harry’s spellbooks, wand, cauldron, and
broomstick at the start of the summer break, and forbid him to talk to the
neighbors.
This separation from his spellbooks had been a real problem for Harry,
because his teachers at Hogwarts had given him a lot of holiday work. One of
the essays, a particularly nasty one about shrinking potions, was for Harry’ n his investigations
into his previously despised mother’s family — the woman whom, you will
remember, he had thought could not be a witch if she had succumbed to the
shameful human weakness of death.
“All he had to go upon was the single name ‘Marvolo,’ which he knew
from those who ran the orphanage had been his mother’s father’s name.
Finally, after painstaking research through old books of Wizarding families,
he discovered the existence of Slytherin’s surviving line. In the summer of his
sixteenth year, he left the orphanage to which he returned annually and set off
to find his Gaunt relatives. And now, Harry, if you will stand . . .”
Dumbledore rose, and Harry saw that he was again holding a small crystal
bottle filled with swirling, pearly memory.
“I was very lucky to collect this,” he said, as he poured the gleaming mass
into the Pensieve. “As you will understand when we have experienced it.
Shall we?”
Harry stepped up to the stone basin and bowed obediently until his face
sank through the surface of th and ends up
setting fire to his bed.”
“I think he’s brilliant,” said Harry coldly.
“
Do
 you?” said the boy, with a slight sneer. “Why is he with you? Where
are your parents?”
“They’re dead,” said Harry shortly. He didn’t feel much like going into the
matter with this boy.
“Oh, sorry,” said the other, not sounding sorry at all. “But they were 
ourkind, weren’t they?”
“They were a witch and wizard, if that’s what you mean.”
“I really don’t think they should let the other sort in, do you? They’re just
not the same, they’ve never been brought up to know our ways. Some of them
have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine. I think
they should keep it in the old wizarding families. What’s your surname,
anyway?”
But before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, “That’s you done, my
dear,” and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped
down from the footstool.
“Well, I’ll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,” said the drawling boy.
Harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cre"
What spell is used to unlock doors?,Alohomora,"The spell used to unlock doors is ""Alohomora!""","CHARMS CORRIDOR!”Ducking under Peeves, they ran for their lives, right to the end of the
corridor where they slammed into a door — and it was locked.
“This is it!” Ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at the door, “We’re
done for! This is the end!”
They could hear footsteps, Filch running as fast as he could toward
Peeves’s shouts.
“Oh, move over,” Hermione snarled. She grabbed Harry’s wand, tapped the
lock, and whispered, 
“Alohomora!”
The lock clicked and the door swung open — they piled through it, shut it
quickly, and pressed their ears against it, listening.
“Which way did they go, Peeves?” Filch was saying. “Quick, tell me.”
“Say ‘please.’”
“Don’t mess with me, Peeves, now 
where did they go
?”
“Shan’t say nothing if you don’t say please,” said Peeves in his annoying
singsong voice.
“All right — 
please.
”
“NOTHING! Ha haaa! Told you I wouldn’t say nothing if you didn’t say
please! Ha ha! Haaaaaa!” And they heard the sound of Peeves whooshing
away and Filch cursing in rage.
“He thinks this door is lock  to pass without drawing attention to themselves. He expected to
encounter an obstacle at any moment; his worst fear was Peeves, and he
strained his ears with every step to hear the first, telltale signs of the
poltergeist’s approach.
“This way, Harry,” breathed Luna, plucking his sleeve and pulling him
toward a spiral staircase.
They climbed in tight, dizzying circles; Harry had never been up here
before. At last they reached a door. There was no handle and no keyhole:
nothing but a plain expanse of aged wood, and a bronze knocker in the shape
of an eagle.
Luna reached out a pale hand, which looked eerie floating in midair,
unconnected to arm or body. She knocked once, and in the silence it sounded
to Harry like a cannon blast. At once the beak of the eagle opened, but instead
of a bird’s call, a soft, musical voice said, “Which came first, the phoenix or
the flame?”
“Hmm . . . What do you think, Harry?” said Luna, looking thoughtful.
“What? Isn’t there just a password?”
“Oh no, you’ve got to answer a questi tant; yet it was almost empty but for a residue of old underwear,

where it began to cartwheel in circles. Moody jerked his wand, and the spider
rose onto two of its hind legs and went into what was unmistakably a tap
dance.
Everyone was laughing — everyone except Moody.
“Think it’s funny, do you?” he growled. “You’d like it, would you, if I did
it to you?”
The laughter died away almost instantly.
“Total control,” said Moody quietly as the spider balled itself up and began
to roll over and over. “I could make it jump out of the window, drown itself,
throw itself down one of your throats . . .”
Ron gave an involuntary shudder.
“Years back, there were a lot of witches and wizards being controlled by
the Imperius Curse,” said Moody, and Harry knew he was talking about the
days in which Voldemort had been all-powerful. “Some job for the Ministry,
trying to sort out who was being forced to act, and who was acting of their

“I . . . well, as long as Shacklebolt’s work continues to be . . . er . . .

They had walked straight past the golden fountain before Harry remembered.
“Wait . . .” he told Mr. Weasley, and pulling his money bag from his pocket,
he turned back to the fountain.
He looked up into the handsome wizard’s face, but up close, Harry thought
he looked rather weak and foolish. The witch was wearing a vapid smile likea beauty contestant, and from what Harry knew of goblins and centaurs, they
were most unlikely to be caught staring this soppily at humans of any
description. Only the house-elf’s attitude of creeping servility looked
convincing. With a grin at the thought of "
Who teaches Transfiguration at Hogwarts?,Minerva McGonagall,"According to the text, the professors who teach Transfiguration at Hogwarts are:

* Professor McGonagall
* (Note: Professor McGonagall is also mentioned as teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts, but in this context, she is teaching Transfiguration)","was a tiny little wizard who had to
stand on a pile of books to see over his desk. At the start of their first class he
took the roll call, and when he reached Harry’s name he gave an excited
squeak and toppled out of sight.
Professor McGonagall was again different. Harry had been quite right to
think she wasn’t a teacher to cross. Strict and clever, she gave them a talking-
to the moment they sat down in her first class.
“Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you
will learn at Hogwarts,” she said. “Anyone messing around in my class will
leave and not come back. You have been warned.”
Then she changed her desk into a pig and back again. They were all very
impressed and couldn’t wait to get started, but soon realized they weren’t
going to be changing the furniture into animals for a long time. After taking a
lot of complicated notes, they were each given a match and started trying to
turn it into a needle. By the end of the lesson, only Hermione Granger had
made any difference to her  rned how to take care of all the strange plants and fungi, and
found out what they were used for.Easily the most boring class was History of Magic, which was the only one
taught by a ghost. Professor Binns had been very old indeed when he had
fallen asleep in front of the staffroom fire and got up next morning to teach,
leaving his body behind him. Binns droned on and on while they scribbled
down names and dates, and got Emeric the Evil and Uric the Oddball mixed
up.
Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny little wizard who had to
stand on a pile of books to see over his desk. At the start of their first class he
took the roll call, and when he reached Harry’s name he gave an excited
squeak and toppled out of sight.
Professor McGonagall was again different. Harry had been quite right to
think she wasn’t a teacher to cross. Strict and clever, she gave them a talking-
to the moment they sat down in her first class.
“Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you
will learn at Hog ything else
we’ve got to do?”
All the fourth years had noticed a definite increase in the amount of work
they were required to do this term. Professor McGonagall explained why,
when the class gave a particularly loud groan at the amount of Transfiguration
homework she had assigned.
“You are now entering a most important phase of your magical education!”
she told them, her eyes glinting dangerously behind her square spectacles.
“Your Ordinary Wizarding Levels are drawing closer —”
“We don’t take O.W.L.s till fifth year!” said Dean Thomas indignantly.
“Maybe not, Thomas, but believe me, you need all the preparation you can
get! Miss Granger remains the only person in this class who has managed to
turn a hedgehog into a satisfactory pincushion. I might remind you that 
your
pincushion, Thomas, still curls up in fright if anyone approaches it with a
pin!”
Hermione, who had turned rather pink again, seemed to be trying not to
look too pleased with herself.
Harry and Ron were deeply amused when Professor Trelawney "

Hermione’s hand was fastest once more.
“It’s Polyjuice Potion, sir,” she said.
Harry too had recognized the slow-bubbling, mudlike substance in the
second cauldron, but did not resent Hermione getting the credit for answering
the question; she, after all, was the one who had succeeded in making it, back
in their second year.
“Excellent, excellent! Now, this one here . . . yes, my dear?” said Slughorn,
now looking slightly bemused, as Hermione’s hand punched the air again.“It’s Amortentia!”
“It is indeed. It seems almost foolish to ask,” said Slughorn, who was
looking mightily impressed, “but I assume you know what it does?”
“It’s the most powerful love potion in the world!” said Hermione.
“Quite right! You recognized it, I suppose, by its distinctive mother-of-
pearl sheen?”
“And the steam rising in characteristic spirals,” said Hermione
enthusiastically, “and it’s supposed to smell differently to each of us,
according t see him, but
he seems in no immediate danger.”
Harry did as he was told; Dumbledore covered Moody in the cloak, tucked
it around him, and clambered out of the trunk again. Then he picked up the
hip flask that stood upon the desk, unscrewed it, and turned it over. A thick
glutinous liquid splattered onto the office floor.
“Polyjuice Potion, Harry,” said Dumbledore. “You see the simplicity of it,and the brilliance. For Moody never 
does
 drink except from his hip flask, he’s
well known for it. The imposter needed, of course, to keep the real Moody
close by, so that he could continue making the potion. You see his hair . . .”
Dumbledore looked down on the Moody in the trunk. “The imposter has been
cutting it off all year, see where it is uneven? But I think, in the excitement of
tonight, our fake Moody might have forgotten to take it as frequently as he
should have done . . . on the hour . . . every hour. . . . We shall see.”
Dumbledore pulled out the chair at the desk and sat down upon it, his eyes
fixed upon t  a witch
sprouting several extra pairs of arms out of her head.
“Here it is,” said Hermione excitedly as she found the page headed 
The
Polyjuice Potion.
 It was decorated with drawings of people halfway through
transforming into other people. Harry sincerely hoped the artist had imagined
the looks of intense pain on their faces.
“This is the most complicated potion I’ve ever seen,” said Hermione as
they scanned the recipe. “Lacewing flies, leeches, fluxweed, and knotgrass,”
she murmured, running her finger down the list of ingredients. “Well, they’re
easy enough, they’re in the student store-cupboard, we can help ourselves. . . .
Oooh, look, powdered horn of a bicorn — don’t know where we’re going to
get that — shredded skin of a boomslang — that’ll be tricky, too — and of
course a bit of whoever we want to change into.”
“Excuse me?” said Ron sharply. “What d’you mean, a bit of whoever we’re
changing into? I’m drinking

What is the name of Voldemort's snake?,Nagini,The name of Voldemort's snake is Nagini.,"serpent, which relinquished its hold
upon Voldemort at once and turned, hissing furiously, to face Dumbledore.
Voldemort vanished. The snake reared from the floor, ready to strike —
There was a burst of flame in midair above Dumbledore just as Voldemort
reappeared, standing on the plinth in the middle of the pool where so recently
the five statues had stood.
“Look out!” 
Harry yelled.
But even as he shouted, one more jet of green light had flown at
Dumbledore from Voldemort’s wand and the snake had struck —
Fawkes swooped down in front of Dumbledore, opened his beak wide, and
swallowed the jet of green light whole. He burst into flame and fell to thefloor, small, wrinkled, and flightless. At the same moment, Dumbledore
brandished his wand in one, long, fluid movement — the snake, which had
been an instant from sinking its fangs into him, flew high into the air and
vanished in a wisp of dark smoke; the water in the pool rose up and covered
Voldemort like a cocoon of molten glass —
For a few seconds Voldemort w  snake emerged to climb slowly up Voldemort’s chair. It rose,
seemingly endlessly, and came to rest across Voldemort’s shoulders: its neck
the thickness of a man’s thigh; its eyes, with their vertical slits for pupils,
unblinking. Voldemort stroked the creature absently with long thin fingers,
still looking at Lucius Malfoy.
“Why do the Malfoys look so unhappy with their lot? Is my return, my riseto power, not the very thing they professed to desire for so many years?”
“Of course, my Lord,” said Lucius Malfoy. His hand shook as he wiped
sweat from his upper lip. “We did desire it — we do.”
To Malfoy’s left, his wife made an odd, stiff nod, her eyes averted from
Voldemort and the snake. To his right, his son, Draco, who had been gazing
up at the inert body overhead, glanced quickly at Voldemort and away again,
terrified to make eye contact.
“My Lord,” said a dark woman halfway down the table, her voice
constricted with emotion, “it is an honor to have you here, in our family’s
house. There can be no higher ple  Voldemort, who stood with his head bowed, and
his white hands folded over the Elder Wand in front of him. He might have
been praying, or else counting silently in his mind, and Harry, standing still
on the edge of the scene, thought absurdly of a child counting in a game of
hide-and-seek. Behind his head, still swirling and coiling, the great snake
Nagini floated in her glittering, charmed cage, like a monstrous halo.
When Dolohov and Yaxley rejoined the circle, Voldemort looked up.
“No sign of him, my Lord,” said Dolohov.
Voldemort’s expression did not change. The red eyes seemed to burn in the
firelight. Slowly he drew the Elder Wand between his long fingers.
“My Lord —”
Bellatrix had spoken: She sat closest to Voldemort, disheveled, her face a
little bloody but otherwise unharmed.
Voldemort raised his hand to silence her, and she did not speak anotherword, but eyed him in worshipful fascination.
“I thought he would come,” said Voldemort in his high, clear voice, his
eyes on the leaping flames. “I expected"

DUMBLEDORE’S GIANT MISTAKE
Albus Dumbledore, eccentric headmaster of Hogwarts School of
Witchcraft and Wizardry, has never been afraid to make
controversial staff appointments, 
writes Rita Skeeter, Special
Correspondent.
 In September of this year, he hired Alastor “Mad-
Eye” Moody, the notoriously jinx-happy ex-Auror, to teach Defense
Against the Dark Arts, a decision that caused many raised eyebrows
at the Ministry of Magic, given Moody’s well-known habit of
attacking anybody who makes a sudden movement in his presence.
Mad-Eye Moody, however, looks responsible and kindly when set
beside the part-human Dumbledore employs to teach Care ofMagical Creatures.
Rubeus Hagrid, who admits to being expelled from Hogwarts in
his third year, has enjoyed the position of gamekeeper at the school
ever since, a job secured for him by Dumbledore. Last year,

“It — well — it shows me my family —”
“And it showed your friend Ron himself as Head Boy.”
“How did you know — ?”
“I don’t need a cloak to become invisible,” said Dumbledore gently. “Now,
can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?”
Harry shook his head.
“Let me explain. The happiest man on earth would be able to use the
Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it and see
himself exactly as he is. Does that help?”
Harry thought. Then he said slowly, “It shows us what we want . . .
whatever we want . . .”
“Yes and no,” said Dumbledore quietly. “It shows us nothing more or less
than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts. You, who have never
known your family, see them standing around you. Ronald Weasley, who has
always been overshadowed by his brothers, sees himself standing alone, the
best of all of them. However, this mirror will give us neither knowledge or
truth. Men have wasted away before it, entranced by what they have seen, or
bee e other than Albus
Dumbledore. Harry must have walked straight past him, so desperate to get to
the mirror he hadn’t noticed him.“I — I didn’t see you, sir.”
“Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you,” said Dumbledore,
and Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling.
“So,” said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with Harry,
“you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of
Erised.”
“I didn’t know it was called that, sir.”
“But I expect you’ve realized by now what it does?”
“It — well — it shows me my family —”
“And it showed your friend Ron himself as Head Boy.”
“How did you know — ?”
“I don’t need a cloak to become invisible,” said Dumbledore gently. “Now,
can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?”
Harry shook his head.
“Let me explain. The happiest man on earth would be able to use the
Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it and see
himself exactly as he is. Does that help?”
Harry thought. Then he said slo otter. I need to examine this interesting mirror.”
It was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell. It
was the Mirror of Erised.
“This mirror is the key to finding the Stone,” Quirrell murmured, tapping
his way around the frame. “Trust Dumbledore to come up with something like
this . . . but he’s in London . . . I’ll be far away by the time he gets back. . . .”
All Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and stop him
from concentrating on the mirror.
“I saw you and Snape in the forest —” he blurted out.
“Yes,” said Quirrell idly, walking around the mirror to look at the back.
“He was on to me by that time, trying to find out how far I’d got. He
suspected me all along. Tried to frighten me — as though he could, when I
had Lord Voldemort on my side. . . .”Quirrell came back out from behind the mirror and stared hungrily into it.
“I see the Stone . . . I’m presenting it to my master . . . but where is it?”

Harry snapped the earmuffs over his ears. They shut out sound completely.
Professor Sprout put the pink, fluffy pair over her own ears, rolled up thesleeves of her robes, grasped one of the tufty plants firmly, and pulled hard.
Harry let out a gasp of surprise that no one could hear.
Instead of roots, a small, muddy, and extremely ugly baby popped out of
the earth. The leaves were growing right out of his head. He had pale green,
mottled skin, and was clearly bawling at the top of his lungs.
Professor Sprout took a large plant pot from under the table and plunged
the Mandrake into it, burying him in dark, damp compost until only the tufted
leaves were visible. Professor Sprout dusted off her hands, gave them all the
thumbs-up, and removed her own earmuffs.
“As our Mandrakes are only seedlings, their cries won’t kill yet,” she said
calmly as though she’d just done nothing more exciting than water a begonia.

He sat up and felt around, his eyes not used to the gloom. It felt as though he
was sitting on some sort of plant.
“It’s okay!” he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp, which was
the open trapdoor, “it’s a soft landing, you can jump!”
Ron followed right away. He landed, sprawled next to Harry.
“What’s this stuff?” were his first words.“Dunno, some sort of plant thing. I suppose it’s here to break the fall. Come
on, Hermione!”
The distant music stopped. There was a loud bark from the dog, but
Hermione had already jumped. She landed on Harry’s other side.
“We must be miles under the school,” she said.
“Lucky this plant thing’s here, really,” said Ron.
“Lucky!”
 shrieked Hermione. “Look at you both!”
She leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. She had to struggle
because the moment she had landed, the plant had started to twist snakelike
tendrils around her ankles. As for Harry and Ron, their legs had already been
bound tightly in long creepers  ustling noise
behind Harry made him turn: Petunia, hiding behind a tree, had lost her
footing.
“Tuney!” said Lily, surprise and welcome in her voice, but Snape had
jumped to his feet.
“Who’s spying now?” he shouted. “What d’you want?”
Petunia was breathless, alarmed at being caught. Harry could see her
struggling for something hurtful to say.“What is that you’re wearing, anyway?” she said, pointing at Snape’s chest.
“Your mum’s blouse?”
There was a 
crack
: A branch over Petunia’s head had fallen. Lily screamed:
The branch caught Petunia on the shoulder, and she staggered backward and
burst into tears.
“Tuney!”
But Petunia was running away. Lily rounded on Snape.
“Did you make that happen?”
“No.” He looked both defiant and scared.
“You did!” She was backing away from him. “You 
did
! You hurt her!”
“No — no I didn’t!”
But the lie did not convince Lily: After one last burning look, she ran from
the little thicket, off after her sister, and Snape looked miserable and
confused. . . .

Harry finished reading and looked up at Ron, whose mouth was hanging
open.
“How did she find out?” he whispered.
But that wasn’t what was bothering Harry.
“What d’you mean, ‘we all hate Hagrid’?” Harry spat at Malfoy. “What’s

he pointed at Crabbe — “getting a bad bite off a
flobberworm? They haven’t even got teeth!”
Crabbe was sniggering, apparently very pleased with himself.
“Well, I think this should put an end to the oaf’s teaching career,” said
Malfoy, his eyes glinting. “Half-giant . . . and there was me thinking he’d just
swallowed a bottle of Skele-Gro when he was young. . . . None of the
mummies and daddies are going to like this at all. . . . They’ll be worried he’lleat their kids, ha, ha. . . .”

In a bizarre twist, Hagrid is reputed to have developed a close
friendship with the boy who brought around You-Know-Who’s fall
from power — thereby driving Hagrid’s own mother, like the rest of
You-Know-Who’s supporters, into hiding. Perhaps Harry Potter is
unaware of the unpleasant truth about his large friend — but Albus

Both Harry and Ron shouted her down at once.
“It was a laugh!” said Ron, upending a ketchup bottle over his sausages.
“Just a laugh, Hermione, that’s all!”
“Dangling people upside down by the ankle?” said Hermione. “Who puts
their time and energy into making up spells like that?”
“Fred and George,” said Ron, shrugging, “it’s their kind of thing. And, er

“What?” said Ron and Hermione together.
“My dad used this spell,” said Harry. “I — Lupin told me.”
This last part was not true; in fact, Harry had seen his father use the spell
on Snape, but he had never told Ron and Hermione about that particular
excursion into the Pensieve. Now, however, a wonderful possibility occurred
to him. Could the Half-Blood Prince possibly be — ?

I thought I made it clear to you how very important that memory is. Indeed, I
did my best to impress upon you that it is the most crucial memory of all and
that we will be wasting our time without it.”
A hot, prickly feeling of shame spread from the top of Harry’s head all the
way down his body. Dumbledore had not raised his voice, he did not even
sound angry, but Harry would have preferred him to yell; this colddisappoin  father who
never wanted him. Then he returned to the Gaunt hovel, performed the
complex bit of magic that would implant a false memory in his uncle’s mind,
laid Morfin’s wand beside its unconscious owner, pocketed the ancient ring he
wore, and departed.”
“And Morfin never realized he hadn’t done it?”
“Never,” said Dumbledore. “He gave, as I say, a full and boastful
confession.”
“But he had this real memory in him all the time!”
“Yes, but it took a great deal of skilled Legilimency to coax it out of him,”
said Dumbledore, “and why should anybody delve further into Morfin’s mind
when he had already confessed to the crime? However, I was able to secure a
visit to Morfin in the last weeks of his life, by which time I was attempting to
discover as much as I could about Voldemort’s past. I extracted this memory
with difficulty. When I saw what it contained, I attempted to use it to secure
Morfin’s release from Azkaban. Before the Ministry reached their decision,
however, Morfin had died.”

under his left ear, and on Ron’s smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to
flatten his hair.

The Great Hall rang with applause as the Sorting Hat finished.“That’s not the song it sang when it Sorted us,” said Harry, clapping along
with everyone else.
“Sings a different one every year,” said Ron. “It’s got to be a pretty boring

“I do hope this year’s batch of Gryffindors are up to scratch,” said Nearly
Headless Nick, applauding as “McDonald, Natalie!” joined the Gryffindor
table. “We don’t want to break our winning streak, do we?”
Gryffindor had won the Inter-House Championship for the last three years
in a row.
“Pritchard, Graham!”
“SLYTHERIN!”
“Quirke, Orla!”
“RAVENCLAW!”
And finally, with “Whitby, Kevin!”(“HUFFLEPUFF!”), the Sorting ended.
Professor McGonagall picked up the hat and the stool and carried them away.
“About time,” said Ron, seizing his knife and fork and looking expectantly
at his golden plate.
Professor Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was smiling around at the
students, his arms opened wide in welcome.
“I have only two words to say to you,” he told them, his deep voice echoing

What creature is Buckbeak?,Hippogriff,Buckbeak is a hippogriff.,"y, Ron, and
Hermione whip around. Buckbeak the hippogriff was lying in the corner,
chomping on something that was oozing blood all over the floor.
“I couldn’ leave him tied up out there in the snow!” choked Hagrid. “All on
his own! At Christmas.”
Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another. They had never seen eye
to eye with Hagrid about what he called “interesting creatures” and other
people called “terrifying monsters.” On the other hand, there didn’t seem to
be any particular harm in Buckbeak. In fact, by Hagrid’s usual standards, he
was positively cute.
“You’ll have to put up a good strong defense, Hagrid,” said Hermione,
sitting down and laying a hand on Hagrid’s massive forearm. “I’m sure you
can prove Buckbeak is safe.”
“Won’t make no diff’rence!” sobbed Hagrid. “Them Disposal devils,
they’re all in Lucius Malfoy’s pocket! Scared o’ him! An’ if I lose the case,
Buckbeak —”
Hagrid drew his finger swiftly across his throat, then gave a great wail and
lurched forward, his face in his arms.
“What about ’s offices in London on that date. In the meantime, the
hippogriff should be kept tethered and isolated.
Yours in fellowship . . .
There followed a list of the school governors.
“Oh,” said Ron. “But you said Buckbeak isn’t a bad hippogriff, Hagrid. I
bet he’ll get off —”
“Yeh don’ know them gargoyles at the Committee fer the Disposal o’
Dangerous Creatures!” choked Hagrid, wiping his eyes on his sleeve.
“They’ve got it in fer interestin’ creatures!”
A sudden sound from the corner of Hagrid’s cabin made Harry, Ron, and
Hermione whip around. Buckbeak the hippogriff was lying in the corner,
chomping on something that was oozing blood all over the floor.
“I couldn’ leave him tied up out there in the snow!” choked Hagrid. “All on
his own! At Christmas.”
Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another. They had never seen eye
to eye with Hagrid about what he called “interesting creatures” and other
people called “terrifying monsters.” On the other hand, there didn’t seem to
be any particular harm in Buckbeak. In fac h. Buckbeak broke into a grudging trot. They
had reached the trees. . . .
“Quick! Quick!” Hermione moaned, darting out from behind her tree,
seizing the rope too and adding her weight to make Buckbeak move faster.
Harry looked over his shoulder; they were now blocked from sight; they
couldn’t see Hagrid’s garden at all.
“Stop!” he whispered to Hermione. “They might hear us —”
Hagrid’s back door had opened with a bang. Harry, Hermione, and
Buckbeak stood quite still; even the hippogriff seemed to be listening intently.
Silence . . . then —
“Where is it?” said the reedy voice of the Committee member. “Where is
the beast?”
“It was tied here!” said the executioner furiously. “I saw it! Just here!”
“How extraordinary,” said Dumbledore. There was a note of amusement in
his voice.
“Beaky!” said Hagrid huskily.
There was a swishing noise, and the thud of an axe. The executioner
seemed to have swung it into the fence in anger. And then came the howling,
and this time they could hear Hagrid’s words through his sobs.“Go"
Who is the founder of Gryffindor House?,Godric Gryffindor,"According to the text, the founder of Gryffindor House is Godric Gryffindor.",". .
“You all know, of course, that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years
ago — the precise date is uncertain — by the four greatest witches and
wizards of the age. The four school Houses are named after them: Godric
Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin.
They built this castle together, far from prying Muggle eyes, for it was an age
when magic was feared by common people, and witches and wizards suffered
much persecution.”
He paused, gazed blearily around the room, and continued.
“For a few years, the founders worked in harmony together, seeking out
youngsters who showed signs of magic and bringing them to the castle to be
educated. But then disagreements sprang up between them. A rift began to
grow between Slytherin and the others. Slytherin wished to be more 
selective
about the students admitted to Hogwarts. He believed that magical learning
should be kept within all-magic families. He disliked taking students ofMuggle parentage, believing them to be untrustworthy. Afte ewn,
There lived four wizards of renown,
Whose names are still well known:
Bold Gryffindor, from wild moor,
Fair Ravenclaw, from glen,
Sweet Hufflepuff, from valley broad,
Shrewd Slytherin, from fen.
They shared a wish, a hope, a dream,
They hatched a daring plan
To educate young sorcerers
Thus Hogwarts School began.Now each of these four founders
Formed their own House, for each
Did value different virtues
In the ones they had to teach.
By Gryffindor, the bravest were
Prized far beyond the rest;
For Ravenclaw, the cleverest
Would always be the best;
For Hufflepuff, hard workers were
Most worthy of admission;
And power-hungry Slytherin
Loved those of great ambition.
While still alive they did divide
Their favorites from the throng,
Yet how to pick the worthy ones
When they were dead and gone?
’Twas Gryffindor who found the way,
He whipped me off his head
The founders put some brains in me
So I could choose instead!
Now slip me snug about your ears,
I’ve never yet been wrong,
I’ll have a look inside your mind
 ers, he caught Colin Creevey’s eye, gave a double thumbs-
up, and mouthed, 
I fell in the lake!
 He looked positively delighted about it.
Professor McGonagall now placed a four-legged stool on the ground before
the first years and, on top of it, an extremely old, dirty, patched wizard’s hat.
The first years stared at it. So did everyone else. For a moment, there was
silence. Then a long tear near the brim opened wide like a mouth, and the hat
broke into song:
A thousand years or more ago,
When I was newly sewn,
There lived four wizards of renown,
Whose names are still well known:

Fair Ravenclaw, from glen,
Sweet Hufflepuff, from valley broad,
Shrewd Slytherin, from fen.

What is the name of the school that Harry Potter attends?,Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry,Harry Potter attends Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.,"ing back
toward the concealed entrance to the Room of Requirement. As they ran, they
met crowds of students, most wearing traveling cloaks over their pajamas,
being shepherded down to the Great Hall by teachers and prefects.
“That was Potter!”
“Harry Potter!”
“It was him, I swear, I just saw him!”
But Harry did not look back, and at last they reached the entrance to the
Room of Requirement. Harry leaned against the enchanted wall, which
opened to admit them, and he and Luna sped back down the steep staircase.
“Wh — ?”
As the room came into view, Harry slipped down a few stairs in shock. It
was packed, far more crowded than when he had last been in there. Kingsley
and Lupin were looking up at him, as were Oliver Wood, Katie Bell, Angelina
Johnson and Alicia Spinnet, Bill and Fleur, and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley.
“Harry, what’s happening?” said Lupin, meeting him at the foot of the
stairs.
“Voldemort’s on his way, they’re barricading the school — Snape’s run for
it — What are you doing here? How did you know?”
“We s rom a doorway to the right — the
rest of the school must already be here — but Professor McGonagall showed
the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in,
standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering
about nervously.
“Welcome to Hogwarts,” said Professor McGonagall. “The start-of-term
banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall,
you will be sorted into your Houses. The Sorting is a very importantceremony because, while you are here, your House will be something like
your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your
House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free time in your House
common room.
“The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and
Slytherin. Each House has its own noble history and each has produced
outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs
will earn your House points, while any rule-breaking will lose House points.
At the end of the “Man the
boundaries, protect us, do your duty to our school!”
Clattering and yelling, the horde of moving statues stampeded past Harry:some of them smaller, others larger, than life. There were animals too, and the
clanking suits of armor brandished swords and spiked balls on chains.
“Now, Potter,” said McGonagall, “you and Miss Lovegood had better
return to your friends and bring them to the Great Hall — I shall rouse the
other Gryffindors.”
They parted at the top of the next staircase, Harry and Luna running back
toward the concealed entrance to the Room of Requirement. As they ran, they
met crowds of students, most wearing traveling cloaks over their pajamas,
being shepherded down to the Great Hall by teachers and prefects.
“That was Potter!”
