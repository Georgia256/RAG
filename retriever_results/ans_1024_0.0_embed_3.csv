Who is Harry Potter's best friend?,Ron Weasley,"According to the context, Harry Potter's best friend is Hermione Granger, who is mentioned by Professor Slughorn as Harry's best friend.","his, “likes his comfort. He also likes the company of the famous, the
successful, and the powerful. He enjoys the feeling that he influences these
people. He has never wanted to occupy the throne himself; he prefers the
backseat — more room to spread out, you see. He used to handpick favorites
at Hogwarts, sometimes for their ambition or their brains, sometimes for their
charm or their talent, and he had an uncanny knack for choosing those who
would go on to become outstanding in their various fields. Horace formed a
kind of club of his favorites with himself at the center, making introductions,
forging useful contacts between members, and always reaping some kind of
benefit in return, whether a free box of his favorite crystalized pineapple or
the chance to recommend the next junior member of the Goblin Liaison
Office.”
Harry had a sudden and vivid mental image of a great swollen spider,
spinning a web around it, twitching a thread here and there to bring its large
and juicy flies a little closer.
“I tell yo 
sniggered, but Slughorn showed no dismay; on the contrary, he beamed and
looked from Hermione to Harry, who was sitting next to her.
“Oho! 
‘One of my best friends is Muggle-born, and she’s the best in our
year!’
 I’m assuming this is the very friend of whom you spoke, Harry?”
“Yes, sir,” said Harry.
“Well, well, take twenty well-earned points for Gryffindor, Miss Granger,”
said Slughorn genially.
Malfoy looked rather as he had done the time Hermione had punched him
in the face. Hermione turned to Harry with a radiant expression and
whispered, “Did you really tell him I’m the best in the year? Oh, Harry!”
“Well, what’s so impressive about that?” whispered Ron, who for somereason looked annoyed. “You 
are
 the best in the year — I’d’ve told him so if
he’d asked me!”
Hermione smiled but made a “shhing” gesture, so that they could hear what
Slughorn was saying. Ron looked slightly disgruntled.
“Amortentia doesn’t really create 
love,
 of course. It is impossible to
manufacture or imitate love. No, this will sim nspiring and the best loved of all Hogwarts headmasters cannot be in
question. He died as he lived: working always for the greater good and,
to his last hour, as willing to stretch out a hand to a small boy with
dragon pox as he was on the day that I met him.
Harry finished reading but continued to gaze at the picture accompanying
the obituary. Dumbledore was wearing his familiar, kindly smile, but as he
peered over the top of his half-moon spectacles, he gave the impression, even
in newsprint, of X-raying Harry, whose sadness mingled with a sense of
humiliation.
He had thought he knew Dumbledore quite well, but ever since reading this
obituary he had been forced to recognize that he had barely known him at all.
Never once had he imagined Dumbledore’s childhood or youth; it was as
though he had sprung into being as Harry had known him, venerable and
silver-haired and old. The idea of a teenage Dumbledore was simply odd, like
trying to imagine a stupid Hermione or a friendly Blast-Ended Skrewt.
He had never th"
What house is Harry Potter sorted into?,Gryffindor,"According to the text, Ron Weasley hopes to be sorted into Gryffindor, as his parents and brothers were in that house.","rom a doorway to the right — the
rest of the school must already be here — but Professor McGonagall showed
the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in,
standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering
about nervously.
“Welcome to Hogwarts,” said Professor McGonagall. “The start-of-term
banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall,
you will be sorted into your Houses. The Sorting is a very importantceremony because, while you are here, your House will be something like
your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your
House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free time in your House
common room.
“The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and
Slytherin. Each House has its own noble history and each has produced
outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs
will earn your House points, while any rule-breaking will lose House points.
At the end of the House you’ll be in?
I’ve been asking around, and I hope I’m in Gryffindor, it sounds by far the
best; I hear Dumbledore himself was in it, but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn’t
be too bad. . . . Anyway, we’d better go and look for Neville’s toad. You two
had better change, you know, I expect we’ll be there soon.”
And she left, taking the toadless boy with her.“Whatever House I’m in, I hope she’s not in it,” said Ron. He threw his
wand back into his trunk. “Stupid spell — George gave it to me, bet he knew
it was a dud.”
“What House are your brothers in?” asked Harry.
“Gryffindor,” said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling on him again. “Mum
and Dad were in it, too. I don’t know what they’ll say if I’m not. I don’t
suppose Ravenclaw 
would
 be too bad, but imagine if they put me in
Slytherin.”
“That’s the House Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who was in?”
“Yeah,” said Ron. He flopped back into his seat, looking depressed.
“You know, I think the ends of Scabbers’ whiskers are a bit lighter,” said
Harry, trying to take Ron’s mind   year, the House with the most points is awarded the House
Cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever House
becomes yours.
“The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest
of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can
while you are waiting.”
Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville’s cloak, which was fastened
under his left ear, and on Ron’s smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to
flatten his hair.
“I shall return when we are ready for you,” said Professor McGonagall.
“Please wait quietly.”
She left the chamber. Harry swallowed.
“How exactly do they sort us into Houses?” he asked Ron.
“Some sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think he was
joking.”
Harry’s heart gave a horrible jolt. A test? In front of the whole school? But
he didn’t know any magic yet — what on earth would he have to do? He
hadn’t expected something like this the moment they arrived. He looked
around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked"
What is the name of Harry Potter's owl?,Hedwig,The name of Harry Potter's owl is Hedwig.,"rry Potter’s, incidentally, who fought the Death Eaters
alongside him at the Ministry in June and —”
But the rest of this story was obscured by the large birdcage standing on
top of it. Inside it was a magnificent snowy owl. Her amber eyes surveyed the
room imperiously, her head swiveling occasionally to gaze at her snoring
master. Once or twice she clicked her beak impatiently, but Harry was too
deeply asleep to hear her.
A large trunk stood in the very middle of the room. Its lid was open; it
looked expectant; yet it was almost empty but for a residue of old underwear,
sweets, empty ink bottles, and broken quills that coated the very bottom.
Nearby, on the floor, lay a purple leaflet emblazoned with the words:
——— 
ISSUED ON BEHALF OF

PROTECTING YOUR HOME AND FAMILY AGAINST DARK
FORCES
The Wizarding community is currently under threat from an organization
calling itself the Death Eaters. Observing the following simple securityguidelines will help protect you, your family, and yo h was large and gray, keeled right over and lay
motionless. There was a large package tied to its legs.
Harry recognized the unconscious owl at once — his name was Errol, and
he belonged to the Weasley family. Harry dashed to the bed, untied the cords
around Errol’s legs, took off the parcel, and then carried Errol to Hedwig’s
cage. Errol opened one bleary eye, gave a feeble hoot of thanks, and began to
gulp some water.
Harry turned back to the remaining owls. One of them, the large snowy
female, was his own Hedwig. She, too, was carrying a parcel and looked
extremely pleased with herself. She gave Harry an affectionate nip with her
beak as he removed her burden, then flew across the room to join Errol.
Harry didn’t recognize the third owl, a handsome tawny one, but he knew
at once where it had come from, because in addition to a third package, it was
carrying a letter bearing the Hogwarts crest. When Harry relieved this owl of
its burden, it ruffled its feathers importantly, stretched its wings, and took off eeching, hooting, and flapping their wings.
“Harry!” said Hermione breathlessly, plunging her hands into the feathery
mass and pulling out a screech owl bearing a long, cylindrical package. “I
think I know what this means — open this one first!”
Harry ripped off the brown packaging. Out rolled a tightly furled copy of
March’s edition of 
The Quibbler. 
He unrolled it to see his own face grinning
sheepishly at him from the front cover. In large red letters across his picture
were the words:
 
HARRY POTTER SPEAKS OUT AT LAST: THE TRUTH ABOUT HE-
WHO-MUST-NOT-BE-NAMED AND THE NIGHT I SAW HIM

“It’s good, isn’t it?” said Luna, who had drifted over to the Gryffindor table
and now squeezed herself onto the bench between Fred and Ron. “It came out
yesterday, I asked Dad to send you a free copy. I expect all these,” she waved
a hand at the assembled owls still scrabbling around on the table in front of
Harry, “are letters from readers.”
“That’s what I thought,” said Hermione eagerly, “Harry, d’you mind if we—"
Who is the headmaster of Hogwarts?,Albus Dumbledore,"According to the passage, the headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is Albus Dumbledore.","unfolded it, and read it, with Ron,
Seamus, Dean, and Neville looking over his shoulder. It was an article topped
with a picture of Hagrid looking extremely shifty.
DUMBLEDORE’S GIANT MISTAKE
Albus Dumbledore, eccentric headmaster of Hogwarts School of
Witchcraft and Wizardry, has never been afraid to make
controversial staff appointments, 
writes Rita Skeeter, Special
Correspondent.
 In September of this year, he hired Alastor “Mad-
Eye” Moody, the notoriously jinx-happy ex-Auror, to teach Defense
Against the Dark Arts, a decision that caused many raised eyebrows
at the Ministry of Magic, given Moody’s well-known habit of
attacking anybody who makes a sudden movement in his presence.
Mad-Eye Moody, however, looks responsible and kindly when set
beside the part-human Dumbledore employs to teach Care ofMagical Creatures.
Rubeus Hagrid, who admits to being expelled from Hogwarts in
his third year, has enjoyed the position of gamekeeper at the school
ever since, a job secured for him by Dumbledore. Last year,
ho werewolf Remus Lupin, half-giant Rubeus Hagrid, and delusional
ex-Auror ‘Mad-Eye’ Moody.
“Rumors abound, of course, that Albus Dumbledore, once Supreme
Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards and Chief Warlock
of the Wizengamot, is no longer up to the task of managing the prestigious
school of Hogwarts.
“‘I think the appointment of the Inquisitor is a first step toward ensuring
that Hogwarts has a headmaster in whom we can all repose confidence,’ said
a Ministry insider last night.
“Wizengamot elders Griselda Marchbanks and Tiberius Ogden have
resigned in protest at the introduction of the post of Inquisitor to Hogwarts.
“‘Hogwarts is a school, not an outpost of Cornelius Fudge’s office,’ said
Madam Marchbanks. ‘This is a further disgusting attempt to discredit Albus
Dumbledore.’ (For a full account of Madam Marchbanks’ alleged links to
subversive goblin groups, turn to page 17.)”
Hermione finished reading and looked across the table at the other two.
“So now we know how we ended up with Umbridg Following the
resignation of the previous Muggle Studies teacher, Alecto Carrow will take
over the post while her brother, Amycus, fills the position of Defense Against
the Dark Arts professor.
“
‘I welcome the opportunity to uphold our finest Wizarding traditions and
values —’ 
Like committing murder and cutting off people’s ears, I suppose!
Snape, headmaster! Snape in Dumbledore’s study — Merlin’s pants!” she
shrieked, making both Harry and Ron jump. She leapt up from the table and
hurtled from the room, shouting as she went, “I’ll be back in a minute!”
“‘Merlin’s pants’?” repeated Ron, looking amused. “She must be upset.”
He pulled the newspaper toward him and perused the article about Snape.
“The other teachers won’t stand for this. McGonagall and Flitwick and
Sprout all know the truth, they know how Dumbledore died. They won’t
accept Snape as headmaster. And who are these Carrows?”
“Death Eaters,” said Harry. “There are pictures of them inside. They were
at the top of the tower when Snape killed Dumbledo"

Anthony Goldstein, his own wand would fly out of his hand, yet Anthony did
not seem to be making a sound. Harry did not have to look far for the solution
of the mystery, however; Fred and George were several feet from Smith and
taking it in turns to point their wands at his back.
“Sorry, Harry,” said George hastily, when Harry caught his eye. “Couldn’t
resist . . .”
Harry walked around the other pairs, trying to correct those who were
doing the spell wrong. Ginny was teamed with Michael Corner; she was
doing very well, whereas Michael was either very bad or unwilling to jinx her.
Ernie Macmillan was flourishing his wand unnecessarily, giving his partner
time to get in under his guard; the Creevey brothers were enthusiastic but
erratic and mainly responsible for all the books leaping off the shelves around
them. Luna Lovegood was similarly patchy, occasionally sending Justin
Finch-Fletchley’s wand spinning out of his hand, at other times merely
causing his hair to stand on end.
“Okay, stop!” Harry s f Zacharias
Smith, who had jeered at Harry for wanting to teach Dumbledore’s Army how
to Disarm.
“Yes, Harry,” said Lupin with painful restraint, “and a great number of
Death Eaters witnessed that happening! Forgive me, but it was a very unusual
move then, under imminent threat of death. Repeating it tonight in front of
Death Eaters who either witnessed or heard about the first occasion was close
to suicidal!”
“So you think I should have killed Stan Shunpike?” said Harry angrily.
“Of course not,” said Lupin, “but the Death Eaters — frankly, most people!
— would have expected you to attack back! Expelliarmus is a useful spell,
Harry, but the Death Eaters seem to think it is your signature move, and I urgeyou not to let it become so!”
Lupin was making Harry feel idiotic, and yet there was still a grain of
defiance inside him.
“I won’t blast people out of my way just because they’re there,” said Harry.
“That’s Voldemort’s job.”
Lupin’s retort was lost: Finally succeeding in squeezing through the door,
Hagrid sta as a
dangerous enemy, another to speak of them, as Snape was doing, with aloving caress in his voice?
“Your defenses,” said Snape, a little louder, “must therefore be as flexible
and inventive as the arts you seek to undo. These pictures” — he indicated a
few of them as he swept past — “give a fair representation of what happens to
those who suffer, for instance, the Cruciatus Curse” — he waved a hand
toward a witch who was clearly shrieking in agony — “feel the Dementor’s
Kiss” — a wizard lying huddled and blank-eyed, slumped against a wall —
“or provoke the aggression of the Inferius” — a bloody mass upon the
ground.
“Has an Inferius been seen, then?” said Parvati Patil in a high-pitched
voice. “Is it definite, is he using them?”
“The Dark Lord has used Inferi in the past,” said Snape, “which means you
would be well-advised to assume he might use them again. Now . . .”
He set off again around the other side of the classroom toward his desk, and
again, they watched him as he walked, his dark robes billowing "
Who teaches Potions at Hogwarts?,Severus Snape,Professor Snape teaches Potions at Hogwarts.," up a
Love Potion! And while you’re at it, Professor Flitwick knows more about
Entrancing Enchantments than any wizard I’ve ever met, the sly old dog!”
Professor Flitwick buried his face in his hands. Snape was looking as
though the first person to ask him for a Love Potion would be force-fed
poison.
“Please, Hermione, tell me you weren’t one of the forty-six,” said Ron as
they left the Great Hall for their first lesson. Hermione suddenly became very
interested in searching her bag for her schedule and didn’t answer.
All day long, the dwarfs kept barging into their classes to deliver
valentines, to the annoyance of the teachers, and late that afternoon as the
Gryffindors were walking upstairs for Charms, one of the dwarfs caught up
with Harry.
“Oi, you! ’Arry Potter!” shouted a particularly grim-looking dwarf,
elbowing people out of the way to get to Harry.
Hot all over at the thought of being given a valentine in front of a line of
first years, which happened to include Ginny Weasley, Harry tried to escape.
  Thursday afternoon’s double
Potions lesson loomed nearer, “is a diversion. Then one of us can sneak into
Snape’s office and take what we need.”
Harry and Ron looked at her nervously.
“I think I’d better do the actual stealing,” Hermione continued in a matter-
of-fact tone. “You two will be expelled if you get into any more trouble, and
I’ve got a clean record. So all you need to do is cause enough mayhem to
keep Snape busy for five minutes or so.”
Harry smiled feebly. Deliberately causing mayhem in Snape’s Potions class
was about as safe as poking a sleeping dragon in the eye.
Potions lessons took place in one of the large dungeons. Thursday
afternoon’s lesson proceeded in the usual way. Twenty cauldrons stood
steaming between the wooden desks, on which stood brass scales and jars of
ingredients. Snape prowled through the fumes, making waspish remarks about
the Gryffindors’ work while the Slytherins sniggered appreciatively. Draco
Malfoy, who was Snape’s favorite student, kept flicking puffer-fish eyes at
Ro p of tea with me around three? I want to hear all about your
first week. Send us an answer back with Hedwig.
HagridHarry borrowed Ron’s quill, scribbled 
Yes, please, see you later
 on the back
of the note, and sent Hedwig off again.
It was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to, because the
Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so
far.
At the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the idea that Professor Snape
disliked him. By the end of the first Potions lesson, he knew he’d been wrong.
Snape didn’t dislike Harry — he 
hated
 him.
Potions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons. It was colder here
than up in the main castle, and would have been quite creepy enough without
the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls.
Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and like
Flitwick, he paused at Harry’s name.
“Ah, yes,” he said softly, “Harry Potter. Our new —

CHAPTER  FOUR
AT FLOURISH AND BLOTTS
ife at the Burrow was as different as possible from life on Privet Drive.
The Dursleys liked everything neat and ordered; the Weasleys’ house
burst with the strange and unexpected. Harry got a shock the first time he
looked in the mirror over the kitchen mantelpiece and it shouted,
“Tuck your
shirt in, scruffy!”
 The ghoul in the attic howled and dropped pipes whenever
he felt things were getting too quiet, and small explosions from Fred and
George’s bedroom were considered perfectly normal. What Harry found most
unusual about life at Ron’s, however, wasn’t the talking mirror or the clanking
ghoul: It was the fact that everybody there seemed to like him.
Mrs. Weasley fussed over the state of his socks and tried to force him to eat
fourth helpings at every meal. Mr. Weasley liked Harry to sit next to him at
the dinner table so that he could bombard him with questions about life with
Muggles  me 
what,
 Arthur?” Mrs. Weasley repeated, in a dangerous sort of
voice.
“It’s nothing, Molly,” mumbled Mr. Weasley, “Fred and George just — but
I’ve had words with them —”
“What have they done this time?” said Mrs. Weasley. “If it’s got anything
to do with Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes —”
“Why don’t you show Harry where he’s sleeping, Ron?” said Hermione
from the doorway.
“He knows where he’s sleeping,” said Ron, “in my room, he slept there last
—”“We can all go,” said Hermione pointedly.
“Oh,” said Ron, cottoning on. “Right.”
“Yeah, we’ll come too,” said George.
“You stay where you are!”
 snarled Mrs. Weasley.
Harry and Ron edged out of the kitchen, and they, Hermione, and Ginny set
off along the narrow hallway and up the rickety staircase that zigzagged
through the house to the upper stories.
“What are Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes?” Harry asked as they climbed.
Ron and Ginny both laughed, although Hermione didn’t.
“Mum found this stack of order forms when she was cleaning Fred and
George’s room,” said Ron quietly.  Slytherins all sing:
Weasley is our King.
 
Weasley was born in a bin,
He always lets the Quaffle in,
Weasley will make sure we win,
Weasley is our King.
 
“— and Alicia passes back to Angelina!” Lee shouted, and as Harry
swerved, his insides boiling at what he had just heard, he knew Lee was
trying to drown out the sound of the singing. “Come on now, Angelina —
looks like she’s got just the Keeper to beat! — SHE SHOOTS — SHE —
aaaah . . .”
Bletchley, the Slytherin Keeper, had saved the goal; he threw the Quaffle to
Warrington who sped off with it, zigzagging in between Alicia and Katie; the
singing from below grew louder and louder as he drew nearer and nearer Ron—
 
Weasley is our King,
Weasley is our King,
He always lets the Quaffle in,
Weasley is our King.
 
Harry could not help himself: Abandoning his search for the Snitch, he
turned his Firebolt toward Ron, a lone figure at the far end of the pitch,
hovering before the three goal hoops while the massive Warrington pelted
toward him . . .

And he knew by her tone that it was his mother and father this time: He
moved toward her, feeling as if something heavy were pressing on his chest,
the same sensation he had had right after Dumbledore had died, a grief that
had actually weighed on his heart and lungs.
The headstone was only two rows behind Kendra and Ariana’s. It was
made of white marble, just like Dumbledore’s tomb, and this made it easy to
read, as it seemed to shine in the dark. Harry did not need to kneel or even
approach very close to it to make out the words engraved upon it.

What platform do students use to board the Hogwarts Express?,Platform 9 3/4,"According to the context, students use platform nine and three-quarters to board the Hogwarts Express."," ten. The only tricky part was doing this in an
unobtrusive way, so as to avoid attracting Muggle attention. They did it in
groups today; Harry, Ron, and Hermione (the most conspicuous, since they
were accompanied by Pigwidgeon and Crookshanks) went first; they leaned
casually against the barrier, chatting unconcernedly, and slid sideways
through it . . . and as they did so, platform nine and three-quarters
materialized in front of them.
The Hogwarts Express, a gleaming scarlet steam engine, was already there,
clouds of steam billowing from it, through which the many Hogwarts students
and parents on the platform appeared like dark ghosts. Pigwidgeon became
noisier than ever in response to the hooting of many owls through the mist.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione set off to find seats, and were soon stowing their
luggage in a compartment halfway along the train. They then hopped back
down onto the platform to say good-bye to Mrs. Weasley, Bill, and Charlie.
“I might be seeing you all sooner than you think,” said Char ough onto
platform nine and three quarters, where the Hogwarts Express stood belching
sooty steam over a platform packed with departing students and their families.Harry inhaled the familiar smell and felt his spirits soar. . . . He was really
going back. . . .
“I hope the others make it in time,” said Mrs. Weasley anxiously, staring
behind her at the wrought-iron arch spanning the platform, through which
new arrivals would come.
“Nice dog, Harry!” called a tall boy with dreadlocks.
“Thanks, Lee,” said Harry, grinning, as Sirius wagged his tail frantically.
“Oh good,” said Mrs. Weasley, sounding relieved, “here’s Alastor with the
luggage, look . . .”
A porter’s cap pulled low over his mismatched eyes, Moody came limping
through the archway pushing a cart full of their trunks.
“All okay,” he muttered to Mrs. Weasley and Tonks. “Don’t think we were
followed . . .”
Seconds later, Mr. Weasley emerged onto the platform with Ron and
Hermione. They had almost unloaded Moody’s luggage cart when Fred,
George, and Ginn  back to us.”
They looked around. People were still watching them, mainly because of
Hedwig’s continuing screeches.
“I think we’d better go and wait by the car,” said Harry. “We’re attracting
too much atten —”
“Harry!” said Ron, his eyes gleaming. “The car!”
“What about it?”
“We can fly the car to Hogwarts!”
“But I thought —”
“We’re stuck, right? And we’ve got to get to school, haven’t we? And even
underage wizards are allowed to use magic if it’s a real emergency, section
nineteen or something of the Restriction of Thingy —”
“But your mum and dad . . .” said Harry, pushing against the barrier again
in the vain hope that it would give way. “How will they get home?”
“They don’t need the car!” said Ron impatiently. “They know how toApparate! You know, just vanish and reappear at home! They only bother
with Floo powder and the car because we’re all underage and we’re not
allowed to Apparate yet. . . .”
Harry’s feeling of panic turned suddenly to excitement.
“Can you fly it?”
“No problem,” said Ron, wheeling his "

and Hermione good-bye, then wheeled the trolley bearing his trunk and

“What’s that?” he snarled, staring at the envelope Harry was still clutching
in his hand. “If it’s another form for me to sign, you’ve got another —”
“It’s not,” said Harry cheerfully. “It’s a letter from my godfather.”
“Godfather?” spluttered Uncle Vernon. “You haven’t got a godfather!”
“Yes, I have,” said Harry brightly. “He was my mum and dad’s best friend.
He’s a convicted murderer, but he’s broken out of Wizard prison and he’s on
the run. He likes to keep in touch with me, though . . . keep up with my
news . . . check if I’m happy. . . .”
And, grinning broadly at the look of horror on Uncle Vernon’s face, Harry
set off toward the station exit, Hedwig rattling along in front of him, for what
looked like a much better summer than the last.

into his previously despised mother’s family — the woman whom, you will
remember, he had thought could not be a witch if she had succumbed to the
shameful human weakness of death.
“All he had to go upon was the single name ‘Marvolo,’ which he knew
from those who ran the orphanage had been his mother’s father’s name.
Finally, after painstaking research through old books of Wizarding families,
he discovered the existence of Slytherin’s surviving line. In the summer of his
sixteenth year, he left the orphanage to which he returned annually and set off
to find his Gaunt relatives. And now, Harry, if you will stand . . .”
Dumbledore rose, and Harry saw that he was again holding a small crystal
bottle filled with swirling, pearly memory.
“I was very lucky to collect this,” he said, as he poured the gleaming mass
into the Pensieve. “As you will understand when we have experienced it.
Shall we?”
Harry stepped up to the stone basin and bowed obediently until his face
sank through the surface of th get who I’ve got with me.”
“Tie that around the bars,” said Fred, throwing the end of a rope to Harry.
“If the Dursleys wake up, I’m dead,” said Harry as he tied the rope tightly
around a bar and Fred revved up the car.
“Don’t worry,” said Fred, “and stand back.”
Harry moved back into the shadows next to Hedwig, who seemed to have
realized how important this was and kept still and silent. The car revved
louder and louder and suddenly, with a crunching noise, the bars were pulled
clean out of the window as Fred drove straight up in the air. Harry ran back to
the window to see the bars dangling a few feet above the ground. Panting,
Ron hoisted them up into the car. Harry listened anxiously, but there was no
sound from the Dursleys’ bedroom.
When the bars were safely in the back seat with Ron, Fred reversed as close
as possible to Harry’s window.
“Get in,” Ron said.
“But all my Hogwarts stuff — my wand — my broomstick —”
“Where is it?”

possessions was his Nimbus Two Thousand racing broom.
Harry put the leather case aside and picked up his last parcel. He
recognized the untidy scrawl on the brown paper at once: This was from
Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper. He tore off the top layer of paper and
glimpsed something green and leathery, but before he could unwrap it
properly, the parcel gave a strange quiver, and whatever was inside it snapped
loudly — as though it had jaws.
Harry froze. He knew that Hagrid would never send him anything
dangerous on purpose, but then, Hagrid didn’t have a normal person’s view of
what was dangerous. Hagrid had been known to befriend giant spiders, buy
vicious, three-headed dogs from men in pubs, and sneak illegal dragon eggs
into his cabin.
Harry poked the parcel nervously. It snapped loudly again. Harry reached
for the lamp on his bedside table, gripped it firmly in one hand, and raised it
over his head, ready to strike. Then he seized the rest of the wrapping paper in
his other ha unfolded it, and read it, with Ron,
Seamus, Dean, and Neville looking over his shoulder. It was an article topped
with a picture of Hagrid looking extremely shifty.
DUMBLEDORE’S GIANT MISTAKE
Albus Dumbledore, eccentric headmaster of Hogwarts School of
Witchcraft and Wizardry, has never been afraid to make
controversial staff appointments, 
writes Rita Skeeter, Special
Correspondent.
 In September of this year, he hired Alastor “Mad-
Eye” Moody, the notoriously jinx-happy ex-Auror, to teach Defense
Against the Dark Arts, a decision that caused many raised eyebrows
at the Ministry of Magic, given Moody’s well-known habit of
attacking anybody who makes a sudden movement in his presence.
Mad-Eye Moody, however, looks responsible and kindly when set
beside the part-human Dumbledore employs to teach Care ofMagical Creatures.
Rubeus Hagrid, who admits to being expelled from Hogwarts in
his third year, has enjoyed the position of gamekeeper at the school
ever since, a job secured for him by Dumbledore. Last year,
ho keeper duties on the grounds, and Professor Grubbly-Plank
continued to take the Care of Magical Creatures classes. Malfoy was gloating
at every possible opportunity.
“Missing your half-breed pal?” he kept whispering to Harry whenever there
was a teacher around, so that he was safe from Harry’s retaliation. “Missing
the elephant-man?”
There was a Hogsmeade visit halfway through January. Hermione was very
surprised that Harry was going to go.
“I just thought you’d want to take advantage of the common room being
quiet,” she said. “Really get to work on that egg.”
“Oh I — I reckon I’ve got a pretty good idea what it’s about now,” Harry
lied.
“Have you really?” said Hermione, looking impressed. “Well done!”
Harry’s insides gave a guilty squirm, but he ignored them. He still had five
weeks to work out that egg clue, after all, and that was ages . . . whereas if he
went into Hogsmeade, he might run into Hagrid, and get a chance to persuade
him to come back.
He, Ron, and Hermione left the castle together on Saturday "

doesn’t seem too happy about it.
Harry laughed as he put Hermione’s letter aside and picked up her present.
It was very heavy. Knowing Hermione, he was sure it would be a large book
full of very difficult spells — but it wasn’t. His heart gave a huge bound as he
ripped back the paper and saw a sleek black leather case, with silver words
stamped across it, reading 
Broomstick Servicing Kit
.
“Wow, Hermione!” Harry whispered, unzipping the case to look inside.
There was a large jar of Fleetwood’s High-Finish Handle Polish, a pair of
gleaming silver Tail-Twig Clippers, a tiny brass compass to clip on yourbroom for long journeys, and a 
Handbook of Do-It-Yourself Broomcare.
Apart from his friends, the thing that Harry missed most about Hogwarts
was Quidditch, the most popular sport in the magical world — highly
dangerous, very exciting, and played on broomsticks. Harry happened to be a
very good Quidditch player; he had been the youngest person in a century to
be picked for one of the Hogwarts House team on. At either end of the field were
three golden poles with hoops on the end. They reminded Harry of the little
plastic sticks Muggle children blew bubbles through, except that they were
fifty feet high.
Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry mounted his broomstick and
kicked off from the ground. What a feeling — he swooped in and out of the
goalposts and then sped up and down the field. The Nimbus Two Thousand
turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch.
“Hey, Potter, come down!”
Oliver Wood had arrived. He was carrying a large wooden crate under his
arm. Harry landed next to him.
“Very nice,” said Wood, his eyes glinting. “I see what McGonagall
meant . . . you really are a natural. I’m just going to teach you the rules this
evening, then you’ll be joining team practice three times a week.”
He opened the crate. Inside were four different-sized balls.
“Right,” said Wood. “Now, Quidditch is easy enough to understand, even if
it’s not too easy to play. There are seven players on each side. Three of  at’s your Quidditch team?” Ron asked.“Er — I don’t know any,” Harry confessed.
“What!” Ron looked dumbfounded. “Oh, you wait, it’s the best game in the
world —” And he was off, explaining all about the four balls and the
positions of the seven players, describing famous games he’d been to with his
brothers and the broomstick he’d like to get if he had the money. He was just
taking Harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door
slid open yet again, but it wasn’t Neville the toadless boy, or Hermione
Granger this time.
Three boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle one at once: It was
the pale boy from Madam Malkin’s robe shop. He was looking at Harry with
a lot more interest than he’d shown back in Diagon Alley.
“Is it true?” he said. “They’re saying all down the train that Harry Potter’s
in this compartment. So it’s you, is it?”
“Yes,” said Harry. He was looking at the other boys. Both of them were
thickset and looked extremely mean. Standing on either side of the pale boy,
they loo"

Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington at your service. Resident ghost of
Gryffindor Tower.”
“I know who you are!” said Ron suddenly. “My brothers told me about you
— you’re Nearly Headless Nick!”
“I would 
prefer
 you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy —” the ghost began
stiffly, but sandy-haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted.
“
Nearly
 Headless? How can you be 
nearly
 headless?”
Sir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little chat wasn’t going at
all the way he wanted.
“Like 
this,
” he said irritably. He seized his left ear and pulled. His whole
head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge.
Someone had obviously tried to behead him, but not done it properly.
Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces, Nearly Headless Nick
flipped his head back onto his neck, coughed, and said, “So — new
Gryffindors! I hope you’re going to help us win the House Championship this
year? Gryffindors have never gone so long without winning. Slytherins havegot the Cup six years ings at friends from other Houses, eyeing one another’s new haircuts and
robes. Again Harry noticed people putting their heads together to whisper as
he passed; he gritted his teeth and tried to act as though he neither noticed nor
cared.
Luna drifted away from them at the Ravenclaw table. The moment they
reached Gryffindor’s, Ginny was hailed by some fellow fourth years and left
to sit with them; Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Neville found seats together
about halfway down the table between Nearly Headless Nick, the Gryffindor
House ghost, and Parvati Patil and Lavender Brown, the last two of whom
gave Harry airy, overly friendly greetings that made him quite sure they had
stopped talking about him a split second before. He had more important
things to worry about, however: He was looking over the students’ heads to
the staff table that ran along the top wall of the Hall.
“He’s not there.”
Ron and Hermione scanned the staff table too, though there was no real
need; Hagrid’s size made him instantly obvious in any ching the
bottom of the stairs, where Nearly Headless Nick, ghost of Gryffindor Tower,
stood waiting for him.
“Harry! My dear boy!”Nick made to grasp Harry’s hands with both of his own: Harry’s felt as
though they had been thrust into icy water.
“Nick, you’ve got to help me. Who’s the ghost of Ravenclaw Tower?”
Nearly Headless Nick looked surprised and a little offended.
“The Gray Lady, of course; but if it is ghostly services you require — ?”
“It’s got to be her — d’you know where she is?”
“Let’s see. . . .”
Nick’s head wobbled a little on his ruff as he turned hither and thither,
peering over the heads of the swarming students.
“That’s her over there, Harry, the young woman with the long hair.”
Harry looked in the direction of Nick’s transparent, pointing finger and saw
a tall ghost who caught sight of Harry looking at her, raised her eyebrows, and
drifted away through a solid wall.
Harry ran after her. Once through the door of the corridor into which she
had disappeared, he saw her at the very end of the p"

“C’mon, let’s go. If we hurry we’ll be able to follow the Hogwarts Express
—”
And they marched off through the crowd of curious Muggles, out of the
station and back onto the side road where the old Ford Anglia was parked.
Ron unlocked the cavernous trunk with a series of taps from his wand.
They heaved their luggage back in, put Hedwig on the back seat, and got into
the front.
“Check that no one’s watching,” said Ron, starting the ignition with another
tap of his wand. Harry stuck his head out of the window: Traffic was
rumbling along the main road ahead, but their street was empty.
“Okay,” he said.
Ron pressed a tiny silver button on the dashboard. The car around them
vanished — and so did they. Harry could feel the seat vibrating beneath him,
hear the engine, feel his hands on his knees and his glasses on his nose, but
for all he could see, he had become a pair of eyeballs, floating a few feet
above the ground in a dingy street full of parked cars.
“Let’s go,” said Ron’s voi  back to us.”
They looked around. People were still watching them, mainly because of
Hedwig’s continuing screeches.
“I think we’d better go and wait by the car,” said Harry. “We’re attracting
too much atten —”
“Harry!” said Ron, his eyes gleaming. “The car!”
“What about it?”
“We can fly the car to Hogwarts!”
“But I thought —”
“We’re stuck, right? And we’ve got to get to school, haven’t we? And even
underage wizards are allowed to use magic if it’s a real emergency, section
nineteen or something of the Restriction of Thingy —”
“But your mum and dad . . .” said Harry, pushing against the barrier again
in the vain hope that it would give way. “How will they get home?”
“They don’t need the car!” said Ron impatiently. “They know how toApparate! You know, just vanish and reappear at home! They only bother
with Floo powder and the car because we’re all underage and we’re not
allowed to Apparate yet. . . .”
Harry’s feeling of panic turned suddenly to excitement.
“Can you fly it?”
“No problem,” said Ron, wheeling his   are those horse things?” Harry said, as he, Ron, and
Luna made for the carriage in which Hermione and Ginny were already
sitting.“What horse things?”
“The horse things pulling the carriages!” said Harry impatiently; they were,
after all, about three feet from the nearest one; it was watching them with
empty white eyes. Ron, however, gave Harry a perplexed look.
“What are you talking about?”
“I’m talking about — look!”
Harry grabbed Ron’s arm and wheeled him about so that he was face-to-
face with the winged horse. Ron stared straight at it for a second, then looked
back at Harry.
“What am I supposed to be looking at?”
“At the — there, between the shafts! Harnessed to the coach! It’s right
there in front —”
But as Ron continued to look bemused, a strange thought occurred to
Harry.
“Can’t . . . can’t you see them?”
“See 
what
?”
“Can’t you see what’s pulling the carriages?”
Ron looked seriously alarmed now.
“Are you feeling all right, Harry?”
“I . . . yeah . . .”
Harry felt utterly bewildered. The horse was th"

to a house-elf!”
“Yeah, we don’t need to hear about you being in love with Malfoy,” Harry
told Kreacher. “Let’s fast forward to where he’s actually been going.”
Kreacher bowed again, looking furious, and then said, “Master Malfoy eats
in the Great Hall, he sleeps in a dormitory in the dungeons, he attends his
classes in a variety of —”
“Dobby, you tell me,” said Harry, cutting across Kreacher. “Has he been
going anywhere he shouldn’t have?”
“Harry Potter, sir,” squeaked Dobby, his great orblike eyes shining in the
firelight, “the Malfoy boy is breaking no rules that Dobby can discover, but
he is still keen to avoid detection. He has been making regular visits to the
seventh floor with a variety of other students, who keep watch for him while
he enters —”“The Room of Requirement!” said Harry, smacking himself hard on the
forehead with 
Advanced Potion-Making.
 Hermione and Ron stared at him.
“That’s where he’s been sneaking off to! That’s where he’s doing . . .

“Must be, it’s not a very common name, is it?” said Harry. “Why?”
“I’ve heard Dad talking about him,” said George. “He was a big supporter
of You-Know-Who.”
“And when You-Know-Who disappeared,” said Fred, craning around to
look at Harry, “Lucius Malfoy came back saying he’d never meant any of it.
Load of dung — Dad reckons he was right in You-Know-Who’s inner circle.”
Harry had heard these rumors about Malfoy’s family before, and they
didn’t surprise him at all. Malfoy made Dudley Dursley look like a kind,
thoughtful, and sensitive boy.
“I don’t know whether the Malfoys own a house-elf. . . .” said Harry.
“Well, whoever owns him will be an old Wizarding family, and they’ll be
rich,” said Fred.
“Yeah, Mum’s always wishing we had a house-elf to do the ironing,” said
George. “But all we’ve got is a lousy old ghoul in the attic and gnomes all
over the garden. House-elves come with big old manors and castles and
places like that; you wouldn’t catch one in our house. .  frozen, staring at the elf. Then he lunged at Harry.
“You’ve lost me my servant, boy!”
But Dobby shouted, “You shall not harm Harry Potter!”
There was a loud bang, and Mr. Malfoy was thrown backward. He crashed
down the stairs, three at a time, landing in a crumpled heap on the landingbelow. He got up, his face livid, and pulled out his wand, but Dobby raised a
long, threatening finger.
“You shall go now,” he said fiercely, pointing down at Mr. Malfoy. “You
shall not touch Harry Potter. You shall go now.”
Lucius Malfoy had no choice. With a last, incensed stare at the pair of
them, he swung his cloak around him and hurried out of sight.
“Harry Potter freed Dobby!” said the elf shrilly, gazing up at Harry,
moonlight from the nearest window reflected in his orb-like eyes. “Harry
Potter set Dobby free!”
“Least I could do, Dobby,” said Harry, grinning. “Just promise never to try
and save my life again.”
The elf’s ugly brown face split suddenly into a wide, toothy smile.
“I’ve just got one question, Dobby,” said H"

“But you are normal!” said Harry fiercely. “You’ve just got a — a problem

Lupin burst out laughing. “Sometimes you remind me a lot of James. He
called it my ‘furry little problem’ in company. Many people were under the
impression that I owned a badly behaved rabbit.”
He accepted a glass of eggnog from Mr. Weasley with a word of thanks,
looking slightly more cheerful. Harry, meanwhile, felt a rush of excitement:
This last mention of his father had reminded him that there was something he
had been looking forward to asking Lupin.
“Have you ever heard of someone called the Half-Blood Prince?”
“The Half-Blood what?”
“Prince,” said Harry, watching him closely for signs of recognition.
“There are no Wizarding princes,” said Lupin, now smiling. “Is this a title
you’re thinking of adopting? I should have thought being ‘the Chosen One’
would be enough.”
“It’s nothing to do with me!” said Harry indignantly. “The Half-Blood
Prince is someon from the Half-Blood Prince than Snape or Slughorn have taught
me in —”
“I’m not talking about your stupid so-called Prince,” said Hermione, giving
his book a nasty look as though it had been rude to her. “I’m talking about
earlier. I went into the girls’ bathroom just before I came in here and there
were about a dozen girls in there, including that Romilda Vane, trying to
decide how to slip you a love potion. They’re all hoping they’re going to get
you to take them to Slughorn’s party, and they all seem to have bought Fred
and George’s love potions, which I’m afraid to say probably work —”
“Why didn’t you confiscate them then?” demanded Harry. It seemed
extraordinary that Hermione’s mania for upholding rules could have
abandoned her at this crucial juncture.
“They didn’t have the potions with them in the bathroom,” said Hermione
scornfully. “They were just discussing tactics. As I doubt whether even the

up an antidote for a dozen diff ,” she added, as Harry and Ron rolled their eyes, “because I’m
starting to think this Prince character was a bit dodgy.”
Both Harry and Ron shouted her down at once.
“It was a laugh!” said Ron, upending a ketchup bottle over his sausages.
“Just a laugh, Hermione, that’s all!”
“Dangling people upside down by the ankle?” said Hermione. “Who puts
their time and energy into making up spells like that?”
“Fred and George,” said Ron, shrugging, “it’s their kind of thing. And, er
—”
“My dad,” said Harry. He had only just remembered.
“What?” said Ron and Hermione together.
“My dad used this spell,” said Harry. “I — Lupin told me.”
This last part was not true; in fact, Harry had seen his father use the spell
on Snape, but he had never told Ron and Hermione about that particular
excursion into the Pensieve. Now, however, a wonderful possibility occurred
to him. Could the Half-Blood Prince possibly be — ?
“Maybe your dad did use it, Harry,” said Hermione, “but he’s not the only
one. We’ve seen a whole bunch of people use"
What is the spell to summon objects?,Accio,"The spell to summon objects is ""Accio"".",", from which Harry retrieved it with a Summoning Charm.
Glancing around he thought he had been right to suggest that they practice the
basics first; there was a lot of shoddy spellwork going on; many people were
not succeeding in disarming their opponents at all, but merely causing them to
jump backward a few paces or wince as the feeble spell whooshed over them.“Expelliarmus!” 
said Neville, and Harry, caught unawares, felt his wand
fly out of his hand.
“I DID IT!” said Neville gleefully. “I’ve never done it before — I DID IT!”
“Good one!” said Harry encouragingly, deciding not to point out that in a
real duel situation Neville’s opponent was unlikely to be staring in the
opposite direction with his wand held loosely at his side. “Listen, Neville, can
you take it in turns to practice with Ron and Hermione for a couple of minutes
so I can walk around and see how the rest are doing?”
Harry moved off into the middle of the room. Something very odd was
happening to Zacharias Smith; every time he opened his mouth e crystal ball.
“Good day, my dear,” she said softly. “If you would kindly gaze into the
Orb. . . . Take your time, now . . . then tell me what you see within it. . . .”
Harry bent over the crystal ball and stared, stared as hard as he could,
willing it to show him something other than swirling white fog, but nothing
happened.
“Well?” Professor Trelawney prompted delicately. “What do you see?”
The heat was overpowering and his nostrils were stinging with the
perfumed smoke wafting from the fire beside them. He thought of what Ron
had just said, and decided to pretend.
“Er —” said Harry, “a dark shape . . . um . . .”
“What does it resemble?” whispered Professor Trelawney. “Think,
now . . .”
Harry cast his mind around and it landed on Buckbeak.
“A hippogriff,” he said firmly.
“Indeed!” whispered Professor Trelawney, scribbling keenly on the
parchment perched upon her knees. “My boy, you may well be seeing the
outcome of poor Hagrid’s trouble with the Ministry of Magic! Look
closer. . . . Does the hippogriff app es turned up and, pretending to think that Harry wanted things thrown at
him, started chucking chairs across the room. Harry and Hermione left in a
hurry before the noise attracted Filch, and went back to the Gryffindor
common room, which was now mercifully empty.
At two o’clock in the morning, Harry stood near the fireplace, surrounded
by heaps of objects: books, quills, several upturned chairs, an old set of
Gobstones, and Neville’s toad, Trevor. Only in the last hour had Harry really
got the hang of the Summoning Charm.
“That’s better, Harry, that’s loads better,” Hermione said, looking exhausted
but very pleased.
“Well, now we know what to do next time I can’t manage a spell,” Harry
said, throwing a rune dictionary back to Hermione, so he could try again,
“threaten me with a dragon. Right . . .” He raised his wand once more. 
“Accio
Dictionary!”
The heavy book soared out of Hermione’s hand, flew across the room, and
Harry caught it.
“Harry, I really think you’ve got it!” said Hermione delightedly.
“Just a"

There was a short silence in which many members of the class turned their
heads to frown at the three course aims still written on the blackboard.
“
Using
 defensive spells?” Professor Umbridge repeated with a little laugh.
“Why, I can’t imagine any situation arising in my classroom that would
require you to 
use
 a defensive spell, Miss Granger. You surely aren’t
expecting to be attacked during class?”
“We’re not going to use magic?” Ron ejaculated loudly.
“Students raise their hands when they wish to speak in my class, Mr. — ?”
“Weasley,” said Ron, thrusting his hand into the air.
Professor Umbridge, smiling still more widely, turned her back on him.
Harry and Hermione immediately raised their hands too. Professor
Umbridge’s pouchy eyes lingered on Harry for a moment before she
addressed Hermione.
“Yes, Miss Granger? You wanted to ask something else?”
“Yes,” said Hermione. “Surely the whole point of Defense Against the
Dark Arts is to practice defensive spells?”
“Are you a Minis gainst the Dark Arts,” said
Hermione.
“Me?” said Harry, now grinning more broadly than ever. “No I’m not,
you’ve beaten me in every test —”
“Actually, I haven’t,” said Hermione coolly. “You beat me in our third year
— the only year we both sat the test and had a teacher who actually knew the
subject. But I’m not talking about test results, Harry. Look what you’ve
done
!”
“How d’you mean?”
“You know what, I’m not sure I want someone this stupid teaching me,”
Ron said to Hermione, smirking slightly. He turned to Harry. “Let’s think,” he
said, pulling a face like Goyle concentrating. “Uh . . . first year — you saved
the Stone from You-Know-Who.”
“But that was luck,” said Harry, “that wasn’t skill —”
“Second year,” Ron interrupted, “you killed the basilisk and destroyed
Riddle.”
“Yeah, but if Fawkes hadn’t turned up I —”
“Third year,” said Ron, louder still, “you fought off about a hundred
dementors at once —”
“You know that was a fluke, if the Time-Turner hadn’t —”
“Last year,” Ron said, almost shouting now, “yo n; it hissed menacingly
and turned from turquoise to orange.
“You applied first for the Defense Against the Dark Arts post, I believe?”
Professor Umbridge asked Snape.
“Yes,” said Snape quietly.
“But you were unsuccessful?”
Snape’s lip curled.
“Obviously.”
Professor Umbridge scribbled on her clipboard.
“And you have applied regularly for the Defense Against the Dark Arts
post since you first joined the school, I believe?”
“Yes,” said Snape quietly, barely moving his lips. He looked very angry.
“Do you have any idea why Dumbledore has consistently refused to
appoint you?” asked Umbridge.
“I suggest you ask him,” said Snape jerkily.
“Oh I shall,” said Professor Umbridge with a sweet smile.
“I suppose this is relevant?” Snape asked, his black eyes narrowed.“Oh yes,” said Professor Umbridge. “Yes, the Ministry wants a thorough
understanding of teachers’ — er — backgrounds . . .”
She turned away, walked over to Pansy Parkinson and began questioning
her about the lessons. Snape looked around at Harry and their eyes"

“Certainly. I have a special gift with trolls — you must have seen what I

beat you to death, that three-headed dog didn’t even manage to bite Snape’s
leg off properly.
“Now, wait quietly, Potter. I need to examine this interesting mirror.”
It was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell. It
was the Mirror of Erised.
“This mirror is the key to finding the Stone,” Quirrell murmured, tapping
his way around the frame. “Trust Dumbledore to come up with something like
this . . . but he’s in London . . . I’ll be far away by the time he gets back. . . .”
All Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and stop him
from concentrating on the mirror.
“I saw you and Sna  said Ron finally. “If any dog needs exercise, that one does.”
Hermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again.
“You don’t use your eyes, any of you, do you?” she snapped. “Didn’t you

“The floor?” Harry suggested. “I wasn’t looking at its feet, I was too busy
with its heads.”
“No,

She stood up, glaring at them.

worse, expelled. Now, if you don’t mind, I’m going to bed.”
Ron stared after her, his mouth open.
“No, we don’t mind,” he said. “You’d think we dragged her along,
wouldn’t you?”
But Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as he climbed
back into bed. The dog was guarding something. . . . What had Hagrid said?
Gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to hide
— except perhaps Hogwarts.
It looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby little package
from v ault seven hundred and thirteen was.M

HALLOWEEN
alfoy couldn’t believe his eyes when he saw that Harry and Ron were
still at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful.
Indeed, by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the three-
headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were quite keen to have
another one. In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the package that
seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot
of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection.
“It’s either really valuable or really dangerous,” said Ron.
“Or both,” said Harry.
But as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was
about two inches long, they didn’t have much chance of guessing what it was
without further clues.
Neither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay
underneath the dog and the trapdoor. All Neville cared about was never going
near the dog again.
Hermione was now refusing to spea"
What creature is Aragog?,Acromantula,Aragog is a giant spider.,"d with the light
spilling from Hagrid’s window to illuminate Aragog’s body lying on the edge
of a massive pit beside a ten-foot-high mound of freshly dug earth.
“Magnificent,” said Slughorn, approaching the spider’s head, where eight
milky eyes stared blankly at the sky and two huge, curved pincers shone,
motionless, in the moonlight. Harry thought he heard the tinkle of bottles as
Slughorn bent over the pincers, apparently examining the enormous hairy
head.
“It’s not ev’ryone appreciates how beau’iful they are,” said Hagrid to
Slughorn’s back, tears leaking from the corners of his crinkled eyes. “I didn’
know yeh were int’rested in creatures like Aragog, Horace.”
“Interested? My dear Hagrid, I revere them,” said Slughorn, stepping back
from the body. Harry saw the glint of a bottle disappear beneath his cloak,
though Hagrid, mopping his eyes once more, noticed nothing. “Now . . . shall
we proceed to the burial?”
Hagrid nodded and moved forward. He heaved the gigantic spider into his
arms and, with an enormou pes shifted all around him.
“The thing that lives in the castle,” said Aragog, “is an ancient creature we
spiders fear above all others. Well do I remember how I pleaded with Hagrid
to let me go, when I sensed the beast moving about the school.”
“What is it?” said Harry urgently.
More loud clicking, more rustling; the spiders seemed to be closing in.
“We do not speak of it!” said Aragog fiercely. “We do not name it! I never
even told Hagrid the name of that dread creature, though he asked me, many
times.”
Harry didn’t want to press the subject, not with the spiders pressing closer
on all sides. Aragog seemed to be tired of talking. He was backing slowly into
his domed web, but his fellow spiders continued to inch slowly toward Harry
and Ron.
“We’ll just go, then,” Harry called desperately to Aragog, hearing leaves
rustling behind him.
“Go?” said Aragog slowly. “I think not. . . .”
“But — but —”
“My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid, on my command. But I
cannot deny them fresh meat, when it wanders so will  the misty, domed web, a spider the size of a small
elephant emerged, very slowly. There was gray in the black of his body and
legs, and each of the eyes on his ugly, pincered head was milky white. He was
blind.
“What is it?” he said, clicking his pincers rapidly.
“Men,” clicked the spider who had caught Harry.
“Is it Hagrid?” said Aragog, moving closer, his eight milky eyes wandering
vaguely.
“Strangers,” clicked the spider who had brought Ron.
“Kill them,” clicked Aragog fretfully. “I was sleeping. . . .”
“We’re friends of Hagrid’s,” Harry shouted. His heart seemed to have lefthis chest to pound in his throat.
Click, click, click
 went the pincers of the spiders all around the hollow.
Aragog paused.
“Hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before,” he said slowly.
“Hagrid’s in trouble,” said Harry, breathing very fast. “That’s why we’ve
come.”
“In trouble?” said the aged spider, and Harry thought he heard concern
beneath the clicking pincers. “But why has he sent you?”
Harry thought of getting to his feet"
Who does Harry marry?,Ginny Weasley,"According to the text, Harry does not get married in the Harry Potter series. The context suggests that Harry is being asked to find a partner for a dance, not a romantic partner.","ing to be married!”“Oh,” said Harry blankly. He could not help noticing how Mrs. Weasley,
Hermione, and Ginny were all determinedly avoiding one another’s gaze.
“Wow. Er — congratulations!”
She swooped down upon him and kissed him again.
“Bill is very busy at ze moment, working very ’ard, and I only work part-
time at Gringotts for my Eenglish, so he brought me ’ere for a few days to get
to know ’is family properly. I was so pleased to ’ear you would be coming —
zere isn’t much to do ’ere, unless you like cooking and chickens! Well —
enjoy your breakfast, ’Arry!”
With these words she turned gracefully and seemed to float out of the
room, closing the door quietly behind her.
Mrs. Weasley made a noise that sounded like “tchah!”
“Mum hates her,” said Ginny quietly.
“I do not hate her!” said Mrs. Weasley in a cross whisper. “I just think
they’ve hurried into this engagement, that’s all!”
“They’ve known each other a year,” said Ron, who looked oddly groggy
and was staring at the closed door.
“Well, that’s not very  partners?” He felt himself going red. “I don’t dance,” he said
quickly.
“Oh yes, you do,” said Professor McGonagall irritably. “That’s what I’m
telling you. Traditionally, the champions and their partners open the ball.”
Harry had a sudden mental image of himself in a top hat and tails,
accompanied by a girl in the sort of frilly dress Aunt Petunia always wore to
Uncle Vernon’s work parties.
“I’m not dancing,” he said.
“It is traditional,” said Professor McGonagall firmly. “You are a Hogwarts
champion, and you will do what is expected of you as a representative of the
school. So make sure you get yourself a partner, Potter.”
“But — I don’t —”
“You heard me, Potter,” said Professor McGonagall in a very final sort of
way.
A week ago, Harry would have said finding a partner for a dance would be a
cinch compared to taking on a Hungarian Horntail. But now that he had done
the latter, and was facing the prospect of asking a girl to the ball, he thought
he’d rather have another round with the dragon.
Harry had neve that he had not been thinking about the sword
at all when he suggested they go to Godric’s Hollow. For him, the lure of the
village lay in his parents’ graves, the house where he had narrowly escaped
death, and in the person of Bathilda Bagshot.
“Remember what Muriel said?” he asked eventually.
“Who?”
“You know,” he hesitated: He did not want to say Ron’s name. “Ginny’s
great-aunt. At the wedding. The one who said you had skinny ankles.”
“Oh,” said Hermione. It was a sticky moment: Harry knew that she had
sensed Ron’s name in the offing. He rushed on:
“She said Bathilda Bagshot still lives in Godric’s Hollow.”
“Bathilda Bagshot,” murmured Hermione, running her index finger over
Bathilda’s embossed name on the front cover of 
A History of Magic.
 “Well, I
suppose —”
She gasped so dramatically that Harry’s insides turned over; he drew his
wand, looking around at the entrance, half expecting to see a hand forcing its
way through the entrance flap, but there was nothing there.
“What?” he said, half angry, half re"

“Undesirable Number One,” Harry muttered under his breath as he
replaced Mr. Weasley’s folder and shut the drawer. He had an idea he knew
who that was, and sure enough, as he straightened up and glanced around the
office for fresh hiding places, he saw a poster of himself on the wall, with the
words 
UNDESIRABLE NO. 1
 emblazoned across his chest. A little pink note was
stuck to it with a picture of a kitten in the corner. Harry moved across to read
it and saw that Umbridge had written, 
“To be punished.”
Angrier than ever, he proceeded to grope in the bottoms of the vases and
baskets of dried flowers, b and ends up
setting fire to his bed.”
“I think he’s brilliant,” said Harry coldly.
“
Do
 you?” said the boy, with a slight sneer. “Why is he with you? Where
are your parents?”
“They’re dead,” said Harry shortly. He didn’t feel much like going into the
matter with this boy.
“Oh, sorry,” said the other, not sounding sorry at all. “But they were 
ourkind, weren’t they?”
“They were a witch and wizard, if that’s what you mean.”
“I really don’t think they should let the other sort in, do you? They’re just
not the same, they’ve never been brought up to know our ways. Some of them
have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine. I think
they should keep it in the old wizarding families. What’s your surname,
anyway?”
But before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, “That’s you done, my
dear,” and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped
down from the footstool.
“Well, I’ll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,” said the drawling boy.
Harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cre d Lavender, who were closely followed by
Parvati and Padma Patil with (Harry’s stomach did a back flip) Cho and one
of her usually giggling girlfriends, then (on her own and looking so dreamy
that she might have walked in by accident) Luna Lovegood; then Katie Bell,
Alicia Spinnet, and Angelina Johnson, Colin and Dennis Creevey, Ernie
Macmillan, Justin Finch-Fletchley, Hannah Abbott, and a Hufflepuff girl with
a long plait down her back whose name Harry did not know; three Ravenclaw
boys he was pretty sure were called Anthony Goldstein, Michael Corner, and
Terry Boot; Ginny, followed by a tall skinny blond boy with an upturned nose
whom Harry recognized vaguely as being a member of the Hufflepuff
Quidditch team, and bringing up the rear, Fred and George Weasley with their
friend Lee Jordan, all three of whom were carrying large paper bags crammed
with Zonko’s merchandise.
“A couple of people?” said Harry hoarsely to Hermione. “A

What is the name of the wand shop in Diagon Alley?,Ollivanders,The name of the wand shop in Diagon Alley is Ollivander's.,"most fascinating
Wizarding shops in the world, Harry felt no desire to break his word to Fudge
and stray back into the Muggle world.
Harry ate breakfast each morning in the Leaky Cauldron, where he liked
watching the other guests: funny little witches from the country, up for a day’s
shopping; venerable-looking wizards arguing over the latest article in
Transfiguration Today
; wild-looking warlocks; raucous dwarfs; and once,
what looked suspiciously like a hag, who ordered a plate of raw liver from
behind a thick woollen balaclava.
After breakfast Harry would go out into the backyard, take out his wand,
tap the third brick from the left above the trash bin, and stand back as the
archway into Diagon Alley opened in the wall.
Harry spent the long sunny days exploring the shops and eating under the
brightly colored umbrellas outside cafés, where his fellow diners wereshowing one another their purchases (“It’s a lunascope, old boy — no more
messing around with moon charts, see?”) or else discussing the case of Si anced at
Hermione and drew back into the shadows.
“Madam Lestrange,” murmured Tom, and as Hermione passed he inclined
his head subserviently.
“Good morning,” said Hermione, and as Harry crept past, still carrying
Griphook piggyback under the Cloak, he saw Tom look surprised.
“Too polite,” Harry whispered in Hermione’s ear as they passed out of the
inn into the tiny backyard. “You need to treat people like they’re scum!”“Okay, okay!”
Hermione drew out Bellatrix’s wand and tapped a brick in the nondescript
wall in front of them. At once the bricks began to whirl and spin: A hole
appeared in the middle of them, which grew wider and wider, finally forming
an archway onto the narrow cobbled street that was Diagon Alley.
It was quiet, barely time for the shops to open, and there were hardly any
shoppers abroad. The crooked, cobbled street was much altered now from the
bustling place Harry had visited before his first term at Hogwarts so many
years before. More shops than ever were boarded up, though several new

and paused, looking around.
Diagon Alley had changed. The colorful, glittering window displays of
spellbooks, potion ingredients, and cauldrons were lost to view, hidden behind
the large Ministry of Magic posters that had been pasted over them. Most of
these somber purple posters carried blown-up versions of the security advice
on the Ministry pamphlets that had been sent out over the summer, but others
bore moving black-and-white photographs of Death Eaters known to be on
the loose. Bellatrix Lestrange was sneering from the front of the nearest
apothecary. A few windows were boarded up, including those of Florean
Fortescue’s Ice Cream Parlor. On the other hand, a number of shabby-looking
stalls had sprung up along the street. The nearest one, which had been erected
outside Flourish and Blotts, under a striped, stained awning, had a cardboard
sign pinned to its front:AMULETS

his own powers to you the night he gave you that scar. Not something he
intended to do, I’m sure. . . .”
“Voldemort put a bit of himself in 
me
?” Harry said, thunderstruck.
“It certainly seems so.”
“So I 
should 
be in Slytherin,” Harry said, looking desperately into
Dumbledore’s face. “The Sorting Hat could see Slytherin’s power in me, and
it —”
“Put you in Gryffindor,” said Dumbledore calmly. “Listen to me, Harry.
You happen to have many qualities Salazar Slytherin prized in his hand-
picked students. His own very rare gift, Parseltongue — 
resourcefulness —
determination — 
a certain disregard for rules,” he added, his mustache
quivering again. “Yet the Sorting Hat placed you in Gryffindor. You know
why that was. Think.”
“It only put me in Gryffindor,” said Harry in a defeated voice, “because I
asked not to go in Slytherin. . . .”
“Exactly,”
 said Du  a Slytherin. Perhaps it was Harry’s
imagination, after all he’d heard about Slytherin, but he thought they looked
like an unpleasant lot.
He was starting to feel definitely sick now. He remembered being picked
for teams during gym at his old school. He had always been last to be chosen,
not because he was no good, but because no one wanted Dudley to think they
liked him.
“Finch-Fletchley, Justin!”
“HUFFLEPUFF!”
Sometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the House at once, but at
others it took a little while to decide. “Finnigan, Seamus,” the sandy-haired
boy next to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a whole minute
before the hat declared him a Gryffindor.
“Granger, Hermione!”
Hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head.
“GRYFFINDOR!” shouted the hat. Ron groaned.
A horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts always do when
you’re very nervous. What if he wasn’t chosen at all? What if he just sat there
with the hat over his eyes for ages, until Professor Mc rom a doorway to the right — the
rest of the school must already be here — but Professor McGonagall showed
the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in,
standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering
about nervously.
“Welcome to Hogwarts,” said Professor McGonagall. “The start-of-term
banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall,
you will be sorted into your Houses. The Sorting is a very importantceremony because, while you are here, your House will be something like
your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your
House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free time in your House

“The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and
Slytherin. Each House has its own noble history and each has produced
outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs
will earn your House points, while any rule-breaking will lose House points.

Granger?”
“It’s liquid luck,” said Hermione excitedly. “It makes you lucky!”
The whole class seemed to sit up a little straighter. Now all Harry could see
of Malfoy was the back of his sleek blond head, because he was at last giving
Slughorn his full and undivided attention.
“Quite right, take another ten points for Gryffindor. Yes, it’s a funny little
potion, Felix Felicis,” said Slughorn. “Desperately tricky to make, and
disastrous to get wrong. However, if brewed correctly, as this has been, you
will find that all your endeavors tend to succeed . . . at least until the effects
wear off.”“Why don’t people drink it all the time, sir?” said Terry Boot eagerly.
“Because if taken in excess, it causes giddiness, recklessness, and
dangerous overconfidence,” said Slughorn. “Too much of a good thing, you
know . . . highly toxic in large quantities. But taken sparingly, and very
occasionally . . .”
“Have you ever taken it, sir?” asked Michael Corner with great interest.

sealed with wax. “I wanted Ron to think I’d done it, so I faked it when I knew
you were looking.” He looked at Ron. “You saved everything because you felt
lucky. You did it all yourself.”
He pocketed the potion again.
“There really wasn’t anything in my pumpkin juice?” Ron said, astounded.
“But the weather’s good . . . and Vaisey couldn’t play. . . . I honestly haven’t
been given lucky potion?”
Harry shook his head. Ron gaped at him for a moment, then rounded on
Hermione, imitating her voice. “
You added Felix Felicis to Ron’s juice this
morning, that’s why he saved everything!
 See! I can save goals without help,
Hermione!”
“I never said you couldn’t — Ron, 
you
 thought you’d been given it too!”
But Ron had already strode past her out of the door with his broomstick
over his shoulder.
“Er,” said Harry into the sudden silence; he had not expected his plan to
backfire like this, “shall . . . shall we go up to the party, then?”
“You go!” said ed.
Harry shrugged and continued what he was doing. Seven stirs
counterclockwise, one clockwise, pause . . . seven stirs counterclockwise, one
stir clockwise . . .
Across the table, Ron was cursing fluently under his breath; his potion
looked like liquid licorice. Harry glanced around. As far as he could see, noone else’s potion had turned as pale as his. He felt elated, something that had
certainly never happened before in this dungeon.
“And time’s . . . up!” called Slughorn. “Stop stirring, please!”
Slughorn moved slowly among the tables, peering into cauldrons. He made
no comment, but occasionally gave the potions a stir or a sniff. At last he
reached the table where Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ernie were sitting. He
smiled ruefully at the tarlike substance in Ron’s cauldron. He passed over
Ernie’s navy concoction. Hermione’s potion he gave an approving nod. Then
he saw Harry’s, and a look of incredulous delight spread over his face.
“The clear winner!” he cried to the dungeon. “Excellent, excellent, Harry!

bed and out-of-bounds by Filch the caretaker in the middle of the night once
before, and had no desire to repeat the experience. The Invisibility Cloak
would, of course, be essential, and as an added precaution, Harry thought he
would take the Marauder’s Map, which, next to the Cloak, was the most
useful aid to rule-breaking Harry owned. The map showed the whole of
Hogwarts, including its many shortcuts and secret passageways and, most
important of all, it revealed the people inside the castle as minuscule, labeled
dots, moving around the corridors, so that Harry would be forewarned if
somebody was approaching the bathroom.

It was a map showing every detail of the Hogwarts castle and grounds. But
the truly remarkable thing were the tiny ink dots moving around it, each
labeled with a name in minuscule writing. Astounded, Harry bent over it. A
labeled dot in the top left corner showed that Professor Dumbledore was
pacing his study; the caretaker’s cat, Mrs. Norris, was prowling the second
floor; and Peeves the Poltergeist was currently bouncing around the trophy
room. And as Harry’s eyes traveled up and down the familiar corridors, he
noticed something else.
This map showed a set of passages he had never entered. And many of
them seemed to lead —
“Right into Hogsmeade,” said Fred, tracing one of them with his finger.
“There are seven in all. Now, Filch knows about these four” — he pointed
them out — “but we’re sure we’re the only ones who know about 
these.
 Don’t
bother with the one behind the mirror on the fourth floor. We used it until last
winter, but it’s caved in — completely blocked. And we don’t reckon
an sion on Ron’s
face. Harry strode off through the heather, walking in a large circle with the
distraught Hermione at its center, casting the spells she usually performed to
ensure their protection.
They did not discuss Ron at all over the next few days. Harry was
determined never to mention his name again, and Hermione seemed to know
that it was no use forcing the issue, although sometimes at night when she
thought he was sleeping, he would hear her crying. Meanwhile Harry had
started bringing out the Marauder’s Map and examining it by wandlight. He
was waiting for the moment when Ron’s labeled dot would reappear in the
corridors of Hogwarts, proving that he had returned to the comfortable castle,
protected by his status of pureblood. However, Ron did not appear on the
map, and after a while Harry found himself taking it out simply to stare at
Ginny’s name in the girls’ dormitory, wondering whether the intensity with
which he gazed at it might break into her sleep, that she would somehow

Who is the Triwizard champion from Beauxbatons?,Fleur Delacour,The Triwizard champion from Beauxbatons is Miss Fleur Delacour.,"oke. Nearly everyone laughed, and Dumbledore chuckled appreciatively.
“I am 
not
 joking, Mr. Weasley,” he said, “though now that you mention it, I
did hear an excellent one over the summer about a troll, a hag, and a
leprechaun who all go into a bar . . .”
Professor McGonagall cleared her throat loudly.
“Er — but maybe this is not the time . . . no . . .” said Dumbledore, “where
was I? Ah yes, the Triwizard Tournament . . . well, some of you will not know
what this tournament involves, so I hope those who 
do
 know will forgive me
for giving a short explanation, and allow their attention to wander freely.
“The Triwizard Tournament was first established some seven hundred years
ago as a friendly competition between the three largest European schools of
wizardry: Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, and Durmstrang. A champion was selected
to represent each school, and the three champions competed in three magical
tasks. The schools took it in turns to host the tournament once every five
years, and it was generally agreed to directions, to station themselves around the maze. Bagman now
pointed his wand at his throat, muttered, 
“Sonorus,”
 and his magically
magnified voice echoed into the stands.
“Ladies and gentlemen, the third and final task of the Triwizard
Tournament is about to begin! Let me remind you how the points currently
stand! Tied in first place, with eighty-five points each — Mr. Cedric Diggory
and Mr. Harry Potter, both of Hogwarts School!” The cheers and applause
sent birds from the Forbidden Forest fluttering into the darkening sky. “In
second place, with eighty points — Mr. Viktor Krum, of Durmstrang
Institute!” More applause. “And in third place — Miss Fleur Delacour, of
Beauxbatons Academy!”
Harry could just make out Mrs. Weasley, Bill, Ron, and Hermione
applauding Fleur politely, halfway up the stands. He waved up at them, and
they waved back, beaming at him.
“So . . . on my whistle, Harry and Cedric!” said Bagman. “Three — two —
one —”
He gave a short blast on his whistle, and Harry and Cedric hurried forwar g
champion.
Predictably, Malfoy arrived at Hagrid’s cabin with his familiar sneer firmly
in place.
“Ah, look, boys, it’s the champion,” he said to Crabbe and Goyle themoment he got within earshot of Harry. “Got your autograph books? Better
get a signature now, because I doubt he’s going to be around much longer. . . .
Half the Triwizard champions have died . . . how long d’you reckon you’re
going to last, Potter? Ten minutes into the first task’s my bet.”
Crabbe and Goyle guffawed sycophantically, but Malfoy had to stop there,
because Hagrid emerged from the back of his cabin balancing a teetering
tower of crates, each containing a very large Blast-Ended Skrewt. To the
class’s horror, Hagrid proceeded to explain that the reason the skrewts had
been killing one another was an excess of pent-up energy, and that the
solution would be for each student to fix a leash on a skrewt and take it for a
short walk. The only good thing about this plan was that it distracted Malfoy
completely.

filthy Muggle father’s name forever? I, in whose veins runs the blood of
Salazar Slytherin himself, through my mother’s side? I, keep the name of a
foul, common Muggle, who abandoned me even before I was born, just
because he found out his wife was a witch? No, Harry — I fashioned myself a
new name, a name I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak,when I had become the greatest sorcerer in the world!”
Harry’s brain seemed to have jammed. He stared numbly at Riddle, at the
orphaned boy who had grown up to murder Harry’s own parents, and so many
others. . . . At last he forced himself to speak.
“You’re not,” he said, his quiet voice full of hatred.
“Not what?” snapped Riddle.
“Not the greatest sorcerer in the world,” said Harry, breathing fast. “Sorry
to disappoint you and all that, but the grea self an impressive new

He broke off, looking out the window. He could not stop himself dwelling
upon Dumbledore’s inexcusable trust in Snape . . . but as Hermione had just

“He must’ve known where you were getting it all from.”

didn’t really need Legilimency. . . . He might even have known before then,

Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two
lemon drops, seemed not to notice. “It all gets so confusing if we keep saying
‘You-Know-Who.’ I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying
Voldemort’s name.”
“I know you haven’t,” said Professor McGonagall, sounding half
exasperated, half admiring. “But you’re different. Everyone knows you’re the

What spell is used to produce light from a wand?,Lumos,The spell used to produce light from a wand is Lumos.," lighting his own wand hastily as he went.
An eerie sight met their eyes: They were standing on the edge of a great
black lake, so vast that Harry could not make out the distant banks, in a
cavern so high that the ceiling too was out of sight. A misty greenish light
shone far away in what looked like the middle of the lake; it was reflected in
the completely still water below. The greenish glow and the light from the
two wands were the only things that broke the otherwise velvety blackness,
though their rays did not penetrate as far as Harry would have expected. The
darkness was somehow denser than normal darkness.
“Let us walk,” said Dumbledore quietly. “Be very careful not to step into
the water. Stay close to me.”
He set off around the edge of the lake, and Harry followed close behind
him. Their footsteps made echoing, slapping sounds on the narrow rim of
rock that surrounded the water. On and on they walked, but the view did notvary: on one side of them, the rough cavern wall, on the other, the boundless
 ing Voldemort.
Voldemort was ready. As Harry shouted, 
“Expelliarmus!”
 Voldemort cried,
“Avada Kedavra!”
A jet of green light issued from Voldemort’s wand just as a jet of red light
blasted from Harry’s — they met in midair — and suddenly Harry’s wand
was vibrating as though an electric charge were surging through it; his hand
seized up around it; he couldn’t have released it if he’d wanted to — and a
narrow beam of light connected the two wands, neither red nor green, but
bright, deep gold. Harry, following the beam with his astonished gaze, saw
that Voldemort’s long white fingers too were gripping a wand that was
shaking and vibrating.
And then — nothing could have prepared Harry for this — he felt his feet
lift from the ground. He and Voldemort were both being raised into the air,
their wands still connected by that thread of shimmering golden light. They
glided away from the tombstone of Voldemort’s father and then came to rest
on a patch of ground that was clear and free of graves. . . . The Death Eater 
hands in the pockets of his robes.
“Hmm,” said Mr. Ollivander, “this is a Gregorovitch creation, unless I’m
much mistaken? A fine wandmaker, though the styling is never quite what
I . . . however . . .”
He lifted the wand and examined it minutely, turning it over and over
before his eyes.
“Yes . . . hornbeam and dragon heartstring?” he shot at Krum, who nodded.
“Rather thicker than one usually sees . . . quite rigid . . . ten and a quarter
inches . . . 
Avis!
”
The hornbeam wand let off a blast like a gun, and a number of small,
twittering birds flew out of the end and through the open window into the
watery sunlight.
“Good,” said Mr. Ollivander, handing Krum back his wand. “Which
leaves . . . Mr. Potter.”
Harry got to his feet and walked past Krum to Mr. Ollivander. He handed
over his wand.
“Aaaah, yes,” said Mr. Ollivander, his pale eyes suddenly gleaming. “Yes,
yes, yes. How well I remember.”
Harry could remember too. He could remember it as though it had
happened yesterday. . . .

“What 
was
 that?”
“It was either a very big cat or quite a small tiger,” said Harry.
“Where’s Hermione?”
“Probably getting her owl —”
They made their way back up the crowded street to the Magical Menagerie.
As they reached it, Hermione came out, but she wasn’t carrying an owl. Her
arms were clamped tightly around the enormous ginger cat.
“You 
bought
 that monster?” said Ron, his mouth hanging open.
“He’s 
gorgeous,
 isn’t he?” said Hermione, glowing.
That was a matter of opinion, thought Harry. The cat’s ginger fur was thick
and fluffy, but it was definitely a bit bowlegged and its face looked grumpy
and oddly squashed, as though it had run headlong into a brick wall. Now that
Scabbers was out of sight, however, the cat was purring contentedly in
Hermione’s arms.
“Hermione, that thing nearly scalped me!” said Ron.
“He didn’t mean to, did you, Crookshanks?” said Hermione.
“And what about Scabbers?” said Ron, pointing at the lump in his chest
pocket. “He needs rest and relaxation! How’s he g y had only gone a few paces when Hermione’s bandy-legged ginger
cat, Crookshanks, came pelting out of the garden, bottlebrush tail held high in
the air, chasing what looked like a muddy potato on legs. Harry recognized it
instantly as a gnome. Barely ten inches high, its horny little feet pattered very
fast as it sprinted across the yard and dived headlong into one of the
Wellington boots that lay scattered around the door. Harry could hear the
gnome giggling madly as Crookshanks inserted a paw into the boot, trying to
reach it. Meanwhile, a very loud crashing noise was coming from the other
side of the house. The source of the commotion was revealed as they entered
the garden, and saw that Bill and Charlie both had their wands out, and were
making two battered old tables fly high above the lawn, smashing into each
other, each attempting to knock the other’s out of the air. Fred and George
were cheering, Ginny was laughing, and Hermione was hovering near the
hedge, apparently torn between amusement and anxiet  you still got Millicent’s nose or
something?”
Hermione let her robes fall and Ron backed into the sink.
Her face was covered in black fur. Her eyes had turned yellow and there
were long, pointed ears poking through her hair.
“It was a c-cat hair!” she howled. “M-Millicent Bulstrode m-must have a
cat! And the p-potion isn’t supposed to be used for animal transformations!”
“Uh-oh,” said Ron.
“You’ll be teased something 
dreadful

“It’s okay, Hermione,” said Harry quickly. “We’ll take you up to the
hospital wing. Madam Pomfrey never asks too many questions. . . .”
It took a long time to persuade Hermione to leave the bathroom. Moaning
Myrtle sped them on their way with a hearty guffaw. “Wait till everyone finds

“You needed Alastor Moody,” said Dumbledore. His blue eyes were
blazing, though his voice remained calm.
“Wormtail and I did it. We had prepared the Polyjuice Potion beforehand.
We journeyed to his house. Moody put up a struggle. There was a commotion.
We managed to subdue him just in time. Forced him into a compartment of
his own magical trunk. Took some of his hair and added it to the potion. I
drank it; I became Moody’s double. I took his leg and his eye. I was ready to
face Arthur Weasley when he arrived to sort out the Muggles who had heard a
disturbance. I made the dustbins move around the yard. I told Arthur Weasley
I had heard intruders in my yard, who had set off the dustbins. Then I packed
up Moody’s clothes and Dark Detectors, put them in as though he were trapped
in a nightmare. He was fully aware that even if, by some miracle, he managed
to find a suitable spell, he’d have a real job mastering it overnight. How could
he have let this happen? Why hadn’t he got to work on the egg’s clue sooner?
Why had he ever let his mind wander in class — what if a teacher had once
mentioned how to breathe underwater?
He sat with Hermione and Ron in the library as the sun set outside, tearing
feverishly through page after page of spells, hidden from one another by the
massive piles of books on the desk in front of each of them. Harry’s heart
gave a huge leap every time he saw the word “water” on a page, but more
often than not it was merely “Take two pints of water, half a pound of
shredded mandrake leaves, and a newt . . .”
“I don’t reckon it can be done,” said Ron’s voice flatly from the other side
of the table. “There’s nothing. 
Nothing.
 Closest was that thing to dry up
puddles and ponds, that Drought Charm, but that was nowhere near powerful
enough to   magical power. The part of him that
was still dry was covered in goose pimples; half immersed in the icy water, a
cruel breeze lifting his hair, Harry started to shiver violently. He avoided
looking at the stands; the laughter was becoming louder, and there were
catcalls and jeering from the Slytherins. . . .
Then, quite suddenly, Harry felt as though an invisible pillow had been
pressed over his mouth and nose. He tried to draw breath, but it made his head
spin; his lungs were empty, and he suddenly felt a piercing pain on either side
of his neck —
Harry clapped his hands around his throat and felt two large slits just below
his ears, flapping in the cold air. . . . 
He had gills.
 Without pausing to think, he
did the only thing that made sense — he flung himself forward into the water.The first gulp of icy lake water felt like the breath of life. His head had
stopped spinning; he took another great gulp of water and felt it pass
smoothly through his gills, sending oxygen back to his brain. He stretched out"
Who killed Dumbledore?,Severus Snape,I do not know who killed Dumbledore. The passage provided does not mention Dumbledore's death.,"waited, but Dumbledore did not speak.
“I still don’t understand.”
“Voldemort tried to kill you when you were a child because of a prophecy
made shortly before your birth. He knew the prophecy had been made, though
he did not know its full contents. He set out to kill you when you were still a
baby, believing he was fulfilling the terms of the prophecy. He discovered, to
his cost, that he was mistaken, when the curse intended to kill you backfired.
And so, since his return to his body, and particularly since your extraordinary
escape from him last year, he has been determined to hear that prophecy in its
entirety. This is the weapon he has been seeking so assiduously since his
return: the knowledge of how to destroy you.”
The sun had risen fully now. Dumbledore’s office was bathed in it. The
glass case in which the sword of Godric Gryffindor resided gleamed white
and opaque, the fragments of the instruments Harry had thrown to the floor
glistened like raindrops, and behind him, the baby Fawkes made soft
chirru s were directed only at Voldemort, who
had tampered so ill-advisedly with the deepest laws of magic. Only toward
him was that wand abnormally powerful. Otherwise it was a wand like any
other . . . though a good one, I am sure,” Dumbledore finished kindly.Harry sat in thought for a long time, or perhaps seconds. It was very hard to
be sure of things like time, here.
“He killed me with your wand.”
“He 
failed 
to kill you with my wand,” Dumbledore corrected Harry. “I
think we can agree that you are not dead — though, of course,” he added, as if
fearing he had been discourteous, “I do not minimize your sufferings, which I
am sure were severe.”
“I feel great at the moment, though,” said Harry, looking down at his clean,
unblemished hands. “Where are we, exactly?”
“Well, I was going to ask you that,” said Dumbledore, looking around.
“Where would you say that we are?”
Until Dumbledore had asked, Harry had not known. Now, however, he
found that he had an answer ready to give.
“It looks,” he said slowly, “like King’s  was Dumbledore’s spy
from the moment you threatened her, and he’s been working against you ever
since! Dumbledore was already dying when Snape finished him!”
“It matters not!” shrieked Voldemort, who had followed every word with
rapt attention, but now let out a cackle of mad laughter. “It matters not
whether Snape was mine or Dumbledore’s, or what petty obstacles they tried
to put in my path! I crushed them as I crushed your mother, Snape’s supposed
great 
love
! Oh, but it all makes sense, Potter, and in ways that you do not
understand!
“Dumbledore was trying to keep the Elder Wand from me! He intended that
Snape should be the true master of the wand! But I got there ahead of you,
little boy — I reached the wand before you could get your hands on it, I
understood the truth before you caught up. I killed Severus Snape three hours
ago, and the Elder Wand, the Deathstick, the Wand of Destiny is truly mine!

What shape is Harry's scar?,A lightning bolt,The shape of Harry's scar is lightning-shaped.,"arding world.
Harry looked nothing like the rest of the family. Uncle Vernon was large
and neckless, with an enormous black mustache; Aunt Petunia was horse-
faced and bony; Dudley was blond, pink, and porky. Harry, on the other hand,
was small and skinny, with brilliant green eyes and jet-black hair that was
always untidy. He wore round glasses, and on his forehead was a thin,
lightning-shaped scar.
It was this scar that made Harry so particularly unusual, even for a wizard.
This scar was the only hint of Harry’s very mysterious past, of the reason he
had been left on the Dursleys’ doorstep eleven years before.
At the age of one year old, Harry had somehow survived a curse from the
greatest Dark sorcerer of all time, Lord Voldemort, whose name most witches
and wizards still feared to speak. Harry’s parents had died in Voldemort’sattack, but Harry had escaped with his lightning scar, and somehow —
nobody understood why — Voldemort’s powers had been destroyed the
instant he had failed to kill Harry.
So Harry h e lightning scar on Harry’s forehead with a long,
white finger.
“I’m sorry to say I sold the wand that did it,” he said softly. “Thirteen-and-
a-half inches. Yew. Powerful wand, very powerful, and in the wrong
hands . . . well, if I’d known what that wand was going out into the world to
do. . . .”
He shook his head and then, to Harry’s relief, spotted Hagrid.
“Rubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you again. . . . Oak, sixteen
inches, rather bendy, wasn’t it?”
“It was, sir, yes,” said Hagrid.“Good wand, that one. But I suppose they snapped it in half when you got
expelled?” said Mr. Ollivander, suddenly stern.
“Er — yes, they did, yes,” said Hagrid, shuffling his feet. “I’ve still got the
pieces, though,” he added brightly.
“But you don’t use them?” said Mr. Ollivander sharply.
“Oh, no, sir,” said Hagrid quickly. Harry noticed he gripped his pink
umbrella very tightly as he spoke.
“Hmmm,” said Mr. Ollivander, giving Hagrid a piercing look. “Well, now
— Mr. Potter. Let me see.” He pulled a long tape measure w e only living creature in this house
who didn’t flinch at the sight of him.
Harry, though still rather small and skinny for his age, had grown a few
inches over the last year. His jet-black hair, however, was just as it always had
been — stubbornly untidy, whatever he did to it. The eyes behind his glasses
were bright green, and on his forehead, clearly visible through his hair, was a
thin scar, shaped like a bolt of lightning.
Of all the unusual things about Harry, this scar was the most extraordinary
of all. It was not, as the Dursleys had pretended for ten years, a souvenir of
the car crash that had killed Harry’s parents, because Lily and James Potter
had not died in a car crash. They had been murdered, murdered by the most
feared Dark wizard for a hundred years, Lord Voldemort. Harry had escaped
from the same attack with nothing more than a scar on his forehead, where
Voldemort’s curse, instead of killing him, had rebounded upon its originator.
Barely alive, Voldemort had fled. . . .
But Harry had come f"

setting fire to his bed.”
“I think he’s brilliant,” said Harry coldly.
“
Do
 you?” said the boy, with a slight sneer. “Why is he with you? Where
are your parents?”
“They’re dead,” said Harry shortly. He didn’t feel much like going into the
matter with this boy.
“Oh, sorry,” said the other, not sounding sorry at all. “But they were 
ourkind, weren’t they?”
“They were a witch and wizard, if that’s what you mean.”
“I really don’t think they should let the other sort in, do you? They’re just
not the same, they’ve never been brought up to know our ways. Some of them
have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine. I think
they should keep it in the old wizarding families. What’s your surname,
anyway?”
But before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, “That’s you done, my
dear,” and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped
down from the footstool.
“Well, I’ll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,” said the drawling boy.
Harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cre n his investigations
into his previously despised mother’s family — the woman whom, you will
remember, he had thought could not be a witch if she had succumbed to the
shameful human weakness of death.
“All he had to go upon was the single name ‘Marvolo,’ which he knew
from those who ran the orphanage had been his mother’s father’s name.
Finally, after painstaking research through old books of Wizarding families,
he discovered the existence of Slytherin’s surviving line. In the summer of his
sixteenth year, he left the orphanage to which he returned annually and set off
to find his Gaunt relatives. And now, Harry, if you will stand . . .”
Dumbledore rose, and Harry saw that he was again holding a small crystal
bottle filled with swirling, pearly memory.
“I was very lucky to collect this,” he said, as he poured the gleaming mass
into the Pensieve. “As you will understand when we have experienced it.
Shall we?”
Harry stepped up to the stone basin and bowed obediently until his face
sank through the surface of th ?” asked Harry, who found Ron just as
interesting as Ron found him.
“Er — yes, I think so,” said Ron. “I think Mum’s got a second cousin
who’s an accountant, but we never talk about him.”
“So you must know loads of magic already.”The Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale boy
in Diagon Alley had talked about.
“I heard you went to live with Muggles,” said Ron. “What are they like?”
“Horrible — well, not all of them. My aunt and uncle and cousin are,
though. Wish I’d had three wizard brothers.”
“Five,” said Ron. For some reason, he was looking gloomy. “I’m the sixth
in our family to go to Hogwarts. You could say I’ve got a lot to live up to. Bill
and Charlie have already left — Bill was head boy and Charlie was captain of
Quidditch. Now Percy’s a prefect. Fred and George mess around a lot, but
they still get really good marks and everyone thinks they’re really funny.

because they did it first. You never g"

corridor where they slammed into a door — and it was locked.
“This is it!” Ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at the door, “We’re
done for! This is the end!”
They could hear footsteps, Filch running as fast as he could toward
Peeves’s shouts.
“Oh, move over,” Hermione snarled. She grabbed Harry’s wand, tapped the
lock, and whispered, 
“Alohomora!”
The lock clicked and the door swung open — they piled through it, shut it
quickly, and pressed their ears against it, listening.
“Which way did they go, Peeves?” Filch was saying. “Quick, tell me.”
“Say ‘please.’”
“Don’t mess with me, Peeves, now 
where did they go
?”
“Shan’t say nothing if you don’t say please,” said Peeves in his annoying
singsong voice.
“All right — 
please.
”
“NOTHING! Ha haaa! Told you I wouldn’t say nothing if you didn’t say
please! Ha ha! Haaaaaa!” And they heard the sound of Peeves whooshing
away and Filch cursing in rage.
“He thinks this door is lock  to pass without drawing attention to themselves. He expected to
encounter an obstacle at any moment; his worst fear was Peeves, and he
strained his ears with every step to hear the first, telltale signs of the
poltergeist’s approach.
“This way, Harry,” breathed Luna, plucking his sleeve and pulling him
toward a spiral staircase.
They climbed in tight, dizzying circles; Harry had never been up here
before. At last they reached a door. There was no handle and no keyhole:
nothing but a plain expanse of aged wood, and a bronze knocker in the shape
of an eagle.
Luna reached out a pale hand, which looked eerie floating in midair,
unconnected to arm or body. She knocked once, and in the silence it sounded
to Harry like a cannon blast. At once the beak of the eagle opened, but instead
of a bird’s call, a soft, musical voice said, “Which came first, the phoenix or
the flame?”
“Hmm . . . What do you think, Harry?” said Luna, looking thoughtful.
“What? Isn’t there just a password?”
“Oh no, you’ve got to answer a questi emained unlocked.”
“I’d rather not be interrupted,” said Scrimgeour shortly, “or watched,” he
added, pointing his wand at the windows, so that the curtains swept across
them. “Right, well, I’m a busy man, so let’s get down to business. First of all,
we need to discuss your security.”
The Prime Minister drew himself up to his fullest height and replied, “I am
perfectly happy with the security I’ve already got, thank you very —”
“Well, we’re not,” Scrimgeour cut in. “It’ll be a poor lookout for the
Muggles if their Prime Minister gets put under the Imperius Curse. The new
secretary in your outer office —”
“I’m not getting rid of Kingsley Shacklebolt, if that’s what you’re
suggesting!” said the Prime Minister hotly. “He’s highly efficient, gets
through twice the work the rest of them —”
“That’s because he’s a wizard,” said Scrimgeour, without a flicker of a
smile. “A highly trained Auror, who has been assigned to you for your
protection.”
“Now, wait a moment!” declared the Prime Minister. “You can’t just put

Ron gave an involuntary shudder.
“Years back, there were a lot of witches and wizards being controlled by
the Imperius Curse,” said Moody, and Harry knew he was talking about the
days in which Voldemort had been all-powerful. “Some job for the Ministry,
trying to sort out who was being forced to act, and who was acting of their
own free will.
“The Imperius Curse can be fought, and I’ll be teaching you how, but it
takes real strength of character, and not everyone’s got it. Better avoid beinghit with it if you can. CONSTANT VIGILANCE!” he barked, and everyone
jumped.
Moody picked up the somersaulting spider and threw it back into the jar.
“Anyone else know one? Another illegal curse?”
Hermione’s hand flew into the air again and so, to Harry’s slight surprise,
did Neville’s. The only class in which Neville usually volunteered
information was Herbology, which was easily his best subject. Neville looked
surprised at his own daring.
“Yes?” said Moody, his magical eye rolling right over to out to
fall asleep. “. . . of course . . . Rosmerta. How long has she been under the
Imperius Curse?”
“Got there at last, have you?” Malfoy taunted.
There was another yell from below, rather louder than the last. Malfoy
looked nervously over his shoulder again, then back at Dumbledore, who
went on: “So poor Rosmerta was forced to lurk in her own bathroom and pass
that necklace to any Hogwarts student who entered the room unaccompanied?
And the poisoned mead . . . well, naturally, Rosmerta was able to poison it for
you before she sent the bottle to Slughorn, believing that it was to be my
Christmas present. . . . Yes, very neat . . . very neat . . . Poor Mr. Filch would
not, of course, think to check a bottle of Rosmerta’s. Tell me, how have you
been communicating with Rosmerta? I thought we had all methods of
communication in and out of the school monitored.”
“Enchanted coins,” said Malfoy, as though he was compelled to keep
talking, though his wand hand was shaking badly. “I had one and she had the
other and curse on you isn’t going to tell you what he’s about to do. He’s not
going to do it nice and polite to your face. You need to be prepared. You need
to be alert and watchful. You need to put that away, Miss Brown, when I’m
talking.”
Lavender jumped and blushed. She had been showing Parvati her
completed horoscope under the desk. Apparently Moody’s magical eye could
see through solid wood, as well as out of the back of his head.
“So . . . do any of you know which curses are most heavily punished by
Wizarding law?”
Several hands rose tentatively into the air, including Ron’s and Hermione’s.
Moody pointed at Ron, though his magical eye was still fixed on Lavender.
“Er,” said Ron tentatively, “my dad told me about one. . . . Is it called theImperius Curse, or something?”
“Ah, yes,” said Moody appreciatively. “Your father 
would
 know that one.
Gave the Ministry a lot of trouble at one time, the Imperius Curse.”
Moody got heavily to his mismatched feet, opened his desk drawer, and
took out a glass jar. Three large "

found out what they were used for.Easily the most boring class was History of Magic, which was the only one
taught by a ghost. Professor Binns had been very old indeed when he had
fallen asleep in front of the staffroom fire and got up next morning to teach,
leaving his body behind him. Binns droned on and on while they scribbled
down names and dates, and got Emeric the Evil and Uric the Oddball mixed
up.
Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny little wizard who had to
stand on a pile of books to see over his desk. At the start of their first class he
took the roll call, and when he reached Harry’s name he gave an excited
squeak and toppled out of sight.
Professor McGonagall was again different. Harry had been quite right to
think she wasn’t a teacher to cross. Strict and clever, she gave them a talking-
to the moment they sat down in her first class.
“Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you
will learn at Hog particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into
something else, of course, it’s supposed to be very difficult —”; “You’ll be
starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing —”).
Harry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at the High
Table again. Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet. Professor
McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore. Professor Quirrell, in his
absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose,
and sallow skin.
It happened very suddenly. The hook-nosed teacher looked past Quirrell’s
turban straight into Harry’s eyes — and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar
on Harry’s forehead.
“Ouch!” Harry clapped a hand to his head.
“What is it?” asked Percy.
“N-nothing.”
The pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder to shake off was the
feeling Harry had gotten from the teacher’s look — a feeling that he didn’t
like Harry at all.
“Who’s that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?” he asked Percy.
 as succeeded by double Transfiguration. Professor
Flitwick and Professor McGonagall both spent the first fifteen minutes of
their lessons lecturing the class on the importance of O.W.L.s.
“What you must remember,” said little Professor Flitwick squeakily,
perched as ever on a pile of books so that he could see over the top of his
desk, “is that these examinations may influence your futures for many years
to come! If you have not already given serious thought to your careers, now is
the time to do so. And in the meantime, I’m afraid, we shall be working
harder than ever to ensure that you all do yourselves justice!”
They then spent more than an hour reviewing Summoning Charms, which
according to Professor Flitwick were bound to come up in their O.W.L., and
he rounded off the lesson by setting them their largest amount of Charmshomework ever.
It was the same, if not worse, in Transfiguration.
“You cannot pass an O.W.L.,” said Professor McGonagall grimly, “without
serious application, practice, and study. I see "

the looks of intense pain on their faces.

they scanned the recipe. “Lacewing flies, leeches, fluxweed, and knotgrass,”
she murmured, running her finger down the list of ingredients. “Well, they’re

course a bit of whoever we want to change into.”
“Excuse me?” said Ron sharply. “What d’you mean, a bit of whoever we’re
changing into? I’m drinking 
nothing
 with Crabbe’s toenails in it —”
Hermione continued as though she hadn’t heard hi see him, but
he seems in no immediate danger.”
Harry did as he was told; Dumbledore covered Moody in the cloak, tucked
it around him, and clambered out of the trunk again. Then he picked up the
hip flask that stood upon the desk, unscrewed it, and turned it over. A thick
glutinous liquid splattered onto the office floor.
“Polyjuice Potion, Harry,” said Dumbledore. “You see the simplicity of it,and the brilliance. For Moody never 
does
 drink except from his hip flask, he’s
well known for it. The imposter needed, of course, to keep the real Moody
close by, so that he could continue making the potion. You see his hair . . .”
Dumbledore looked down on the Moody in the trunk. “The imposter has been
cutting it off all year, see where it is uneven? But I think, in the excitement of
tonight, our fake Moody might have forgotten to take it as frequently as he
should have done . . . on the hour . . . every hour. . . . We shall see.”
Dumbledore pulled out the chair at the desk and sat down upon it, his eyes
fixed upon t  a month or so, you feel like explaining, you will let us know, won’t
you?” said Ron irritably.
“All right,” said Hermione coldly. “What we’d need to do is to get inside
the Slytherin common room and ask Malfoy a few questions without him
realizing it’s us.”
“But that’s impossible,” Harry said as Ron laughed.
“No, it’s not,” said Hermione. “All we’d need would be some Polyjuice
Potion.”
“What’s that?” said Ron and Harry together.
“Snape mentioned it in class a few weeks ago —”
“D’you think we’ve got nothing better to do in Potions than listen to
Snape?” muttered Ron.
“It transforms you into somebody else. Think about it! We could change
into three of the Slytherins. No one would know it was us. Malfoy would
probably tell us anything. He’s probably boasting about it in the Slytherin
common room right now, if only we could hear him.”
“This Polyjuice stuff sounds a bit dodgy to me,” said Ron, frowning. “What
if we were stuck looking like three of the Slytherins forever?”
“It wears off after a while,” said Hermio"
What is the name of Voldemort's snake?,Nagini,The name of Voldemort's snake is Nagini.," snake emerged to climb slowly up Voldemort’s chair. It rose,
seemingly endlessly, and came to rest across Voldemort’s shoulders: its neck
the thickness of a man’s thigh; its eyes, with their vertical slits for pupils,
unblinking. Voldemort stroked the creature absently with long thin fingers,
still looking at Lucius Malfoy.
“Why do the Malfoys look so unhappy with their lot? Is my return, my riseto power, not the very thing they professed to desire for so many years?”
“Of course, my Lord,” said Lucius Malfoy. His hand shook as he wiped
sweat from his upper lip. “We did desire it — we do.”
To Malfoy’s left, his wife made an odd, stiff nod, her eyes averted from
Voldemort and the snake. To his right, his son, Draco, who had been gazing
up at the inert body overhead, glanced quickly at Voldemort and away again,
terrified to make eye contact.
“My Lord,” said a dark woman halfway down the table, her voice
constricted with emotion, “it is an honor to have you here, in our family’s
house. There can be no higher ple kill the snake, and the snake was where Voldemort was,
and Voldemort was at the end of this tunnel. . . .
“Harry, we’re coming, just get in there!” said Ron, pushing him forward.
Harry wriggled into the earthy passage hidden in the tree’s roots. It was a
much tighter squeeze than it had been the last time they had entered it. The
tunnel was low-ceilinged: They had had to double up to move through it
nearly four years previously; now there was nothing for it but to crawl. Harry
went first, his wand illuminated, expecting at any moment to meet barriers,
but none came. They moved in silence, Harry’s gaze fixed upon the swinging
beam of the wand held in his fist.
At last the tunnel began to slope upward and Harry saw a sliver of light
ahead. Hermione tugged at his ankle.
“The Cloak!” she whispered. “Put the Cloak on!”
He groped behind him and she forced the bundle of slippery cloth into his
free hand. With difficulty he dragged it over himself, murmured, 
“Nox,”
extinguishing his wandlight, and continued on his h our greatest weakness —”
Another jet of green light flew from behind the silver shield. This time it
was the one-armed centaur, galloping in front of Dumbledore, that took the
blast and shattered into a hundred pieces, but before the fragments had even
hit the floor, Dumbledore had drawn back his wand and waved it as though
brandishing a whip. A long thin flame flew from the tip; it wrapped itself
around Voldemort, shield and all. For a moment, it seemed Dumbledore had
won, but then the fiery rope became a serpent, which relinquished its hold
upon Voldemort at once and turned, hissing furiously, to face Dumbledore.
Voldemort vanished. The snake reared from the floor, ready to strike —
There was a burst of flame in midair above Dumbledore just as Voldemort
reappeared, standing on the plinth in the middle of the pool where so recently
the five statues had stood.
“Look out!” 
Harry yelled.
But even as he shouted, one more jet of green light had flown at
Dumbledore from Voldemort’s wand and the snake had struck —"

Seamus, Dean, and Neville looking over his shoulder. It was an article topped
with a picture of Hagrid looking extremely shifty.
DUMBLEDORE’S GIANT MISTAKE
Albus Dumbledore, eccentric headmaster of Hogwarts School of
Witchcraft and Wizardry, has never been afraid to make
controversial staff appointments, 
writes Rita Skeeter, Special
Correspondent.
 In September of this year, he hired Alastor “Mad-
Eye” Moody, the notoriously jinx-happy ex-Auror, to teach Defense
Against the Dark Arts, a decision that caused many raised eyebrows
at the Ministry of Magic, given Moody’s well-known habit of
attacking anybody who makes a sudden movement in his presence.
Mad-Eye Moody, however, looks responsible and kindly when set
beside the part-human Dumbledore employs to teach Care ofMagical Creatures.
Rubeus Hagrid, who admits to being expelled from Hogwarts in
his third year, has enjoyed the position of gamekeeper at the school
ever since, a job secured for him by Dumbledore. Last year,
ho werewolf Remus Lupin, half-giant Rubeus Hagrid, and delusional
ex-Auror ‘Mad-Eye’ Moody.
“Rumors abound, of course, that Albus Dumbledore, once Supreme
Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards and Chief Warlock
of the Wizengamot, is no longer up to the task of managing the prestigious
school of Hogwarts.
“‘I think the appointment of the Inquisitor is a first step toward ensuring
that Hogwarts has a headmaster in whom we can all repose confidence,’ said
a Ministry insider last night.
“Wizengamot elders Griselda Marchbanks and Tiberius Ogden have
resigned in protest at the introduction of the post of Inquisitor to Hogwarts.
“‘Hogwarts is a school, not an outpost of Cornelius Fudge’s office,’ said
Madam Marchbanks. ‘This is a further disgusting attempt to discredit Albus
Dumbledore.’ (For a full account of Madam Marchbanks’ alleged links to
subversive goblin groups, turn to page 17.)”
Hermione finished reading and looked across the table at the other two.
“So now we know how we ended up with Umbridg tion. Some are going so far as to call Potter
“the Chosen One,” believing that the prophecy names him as the only
one who will be able to rid us of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.
The current whereabouts of the prophecy, if it exists, are unknown,
although (

A second newspaper lay beside the first. This one bore the headline:
SCRIMGEOUR SUCCEEDS FUDGE
Most of this front page was taken up with a large black-and-white picture
of a man with a lionlike mane of thick hair and a rather ravaged face. The
picture was moving — the man was waving at the ceiling.
Rufus Scrimgeour, previously Head of the Auror office in the
Department of Magical Law Enforcement, has succeeded Cornelius
Fudge as Minister of Magic. The appointment has largely been greeted
with enthusiasm by the Wizarding community, though rumors of a rift
between the new Minister and Albus Dumbledore, newly reinstated
Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, surfaced within hours of Scrimgeour
taking office.
Scrimgeour’s representatives admitted "
What does the Mirror of Erised show?,The deepest desire of one's heart,"According to the text, the Mirror of Erised shows each person what they desire most deeply, whether it's something they've always wanted or something they've never known. It shows them their deepest, most desperate desire, but it's not necessarily something that is real or possible.","ized by now what it does?”
“It — well — it shows me my family —”
“And it showed your friend Ron himself as Head Boy.”
“How did you know — ?”
“I don’t need a cloak to become invisible,” said Dumbledore gently. “Now,
can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?”
Harry shook his head.
“Let me explain. The happiest man on earth would be able to use the
Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it and see
himself exactly as he is. Does that help?”
Harry thought. Then he said slowly, “It shows us what we want . . .
whatever we want . . .”
“Yes and no,” said Dumbledore quietly. “It shows us nothing more or less
than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts. You, who have never
known your family, see them standing around you. Ronald Weasley, who has
always been overshadowed by his brothers, sees himself standing alone, the
best of all of them. However, this mirror will give us neither knowledge or
truth. Men have wasted away before it, entranced by what they have seen, or
bee n driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible.
“The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow, Harry, and I ask you
not to go looking for it again. If you ever 
do
 run across it, you will now be
prepared. It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, remember that.
Now, why don’t you put that admirable Cloak back on and get off to bed?”Harry stood up.
“Sir — Professor Dumbledore? Can I ask you something?”
“Obviously, you’ve just done so,” Dumbledore smiled. “You may ask me
one more thing, however.”
“What do you see when you look in the mirror?”
“I? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.”
Harry stared.
“One can never have enough socks,” said Dumbledore. “Another Christmas
has come and gone and I didn’t get a single pair. People will insist on giving
me books.”
It was only when he was back in bed that it struck Harry that Dumbledore
might not have been quite truthful. But then, he thought, as he shoved
Scabbers off his pillow, it had been quite a personal question.D , pulled it out from underneath his trainers, and examined it.
He realized what it was within seconds. Sirius had given it to him just
inside the front door of twelve Grimmauld Place. 
Use it if you need me, all
right?
Harry sank down onto his bed and unwrapped the package. Out fell a small,square mirror. It looked old; it was certainly dirty. Harry held it up to his face
and saw his own reflection looking back at him.
He turned the mirror over. There on the reverse side was a scribbled note
from Sirius.
This is a two-way mirror. I’ve got the other. If you need to speak to me,
just say my name into it; you’ll appear in my mirror and I’ll be able to
talk in yours. James and I used to use them when we were in separate
detentions.
And Harry’s heart began to race. He remembered seeing his dead parents in
the Mirror of Erised four years ago. He was going to be able to talk to Sirius
again, right now, he knew it —
He looked around to make sure there was nobody else there; the dormitory
was quite empty. He looked ba"

Hermione had already jumped. She landed on Harry’s other side.
“We must be miles under the school,” she said.
“Lucky this plant thing’s here, really,” said Ron.
“Lucky!”
 shrieked Hermione. “Look at you both!”
She leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. She had to struggle
because the moment she had landed, the plant had started to twist snakelike
tendrils around her ankles. As for Harry and Ron, their legs had already been
bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing.
Hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on
her. Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off
them, but the more they strained against it, the tighter and faster the plant
wound around them.
“Stop moving!” Hermione ordered them. “I know what this is — it’s
Devil’s Snare!”
“Oh, I’m so glad we know what it’s called, that’s a great help,” snarled
Ron, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck.
“Shut up, I’m and lift him off the ground, so that he was hanging facedown.
Struggling, terrified, he heard more clicking, and saw Ron’s legs leave the
ground, too, heard Fang whimpering and howling — next moment, he was
being swept away into the dark trees.
Head hanging, Harry saw that what had hold of him was marching on six
immensely long, hairy legs, the front two clutching him tightly below a pair
of shining black pincers. Behind him, he could hear another of the creatures,
no doubt carrying Ron. They were moving into the very heart of the forest.
Harry could hear Fang fighting to free himself from a third monster, whining
loudly, but Harry couldn’t have yelled even if he had wanted to; he seemed to
have left his voice back with the car in the clearing.He never knew how long he was in the creature’s clutches; he only knew
that the darkness suddenly lifted enough for him to see that the leaf-strewn
ground was now swarming with spiders. Craning his neck sideways, he
realized that they had reached the ridge of a vast hol . Harry could feel Fang’s hot breath
on his hand. More than once, they had to stop, so that Harry could crouch
down and find the spiders in the wandlight.
They walked for what seemed like at least half an hour, their robes
snagging on low-slung branches and brambles. After a while, they noticedthat the ground seemed to be sloping downward, though the trees were as
thick as ever.
Then Fang suddenly let loose a great, echoing bark, making both Harry and
Ron jump out of their skins.
“What?” said Ron loudly, looking around into the pitch-dark, and gripping
Harry’s elbow very hard.
“There’s something moving over there,” Harry breathed. “Listen . . .
sounds like something big. . . .”
They listened. Some distance to their right, the something big was snapping
branches as it carved a path through the trees.
“Oh, no,” said Ron. “Oh, no, oh, no, oh —”
“Shut up,” said Harry frantically. “It’ll hear you.”
“Hear 
me
?” said Ron in an unnaturally high voice. “It’s already heard
Fang!”
The darkness seemed to be pressing on "

the giant communities still existing in foreign mountain ranges. If
his antics during Care of Magical Creatures lessons are any guide,
however, Fridwulfa’s son appears to have inherited her brutal
nature.
In a bizarre twist, Hagrid is reputed to have developed a close
friendship with the boy who brought around You-Know-Who’s fall
from power — thereby driving Hagrid’s own mother, like the rest of
You-Know-Who’s supporters, into hiding. Perhaps Harry Potter is
unaware of the unpleasant truth about his large friend — but Albus
Dumbledore surely has a duty to ensure that Harry Potter, along
with his fellow students, is warned about the dangers of associating
with part-giants.
Harry finished reading and looked up at Ron, whose mouth was hanging
open.
“How did she find out?” he whispered.
But that wasn’t what was bothering Harry.
“What d’you mean, ‘we all hate Hagrid’?” Harry spat at Malfoy. “What’s
this rubbish about 
him
”
 — 
he pointed at Crabbe — “getting a bad bite off a
flobberworm? They have ,” she added, as Harry and Ron rolled their eyes, “because I’m
starting to think this Prince character was a bit dodgy.”
Both Harry and Ron shouted her down at once.
“It was a laugh!” said Ron, upending a ketchup bottle over his sausages.
“Just a laugh, Hermione, that’s all!”
“Dangling people upside down by the ankle?” said Hermione. “Who puts
their time and energy into making up spells like that?”
“Fred and George,” said Ron, shrugging, “it’s their kind of thing. And, er
—”
“My dad,” said Harry. He had only just remembered.
“What?” said Ron and Hermione together.
“My dad used this spell,” said Harry. “I — Lupin told me.”
This last part was not true; in fact, Harry had seen his father use the spell
on Snape, but he had never told Ron and Hermione about that particular
excursion into the Pensieve. Now, however, a wonderful possibility occurred
to him. Could the Half-Blood Prince possibly be — ?
“Maybe your dad did use it, Harry,” said Hermione, “but he’s not the only
one. We’ve seen a whole bunch of people use ave half a mind to leave now!”
“Empty threat, Karkaroff,” growled a voice from near the door. “You can’t
leave your champion now. He’s got to compete. They’ve all got to compete.

Moody had just entered the room. He limped toward the fire, and with
every right step he took, there was a loud 
clunk.
“Convenient?” said Karkaroff. “I’m afraid I don’t understand you, Moody.”
Harry could tell he was trying to sound disdainful, as though what Moody
was saying was barely worth his notice, but his hands gave him away; they
had balled themselves into fists.
“Don’t you?” said Moody quietly. “It’s very simple, Karkaroff. Someone
put Potter’s name in that goblet knowing he’d have to compete if it came
out.”
“Evidently, someone ’oo wished to give ’Ogwarts two bites at ze apple!”
said Madame Maxime.
“I quite agree, Madame Maxime,” said Karkaroff, bowing to her. “I shall be

What does a Patronus do?,Repels Dementors,"According to the passage, a Patronus is a kind of anti-dementor that acts as a shield between the person conjuring it and the dementor. It is a positive force that is a projection of the things that the dementor feeds upon, such as hope, happiness, and the desire to survive.","ctly, it conjures up a Patronus,” said Lupin,
“which is a kind of anti-dementor — a guardian that acts as a shield between
you and the dementor.”
Harry had a sudden vision of himself crouching behind a Hagrid-sized
figure holding a large club. Professor Lupin continued, “The Patronus is a
kind of positive force, a projection of the very things that the dementor feeds
upon — hope, happiness, the desire to survive — but it cannot feel despair, as
real humans can, so the dementors can’t hurt it. But I must warn you, Harry,
that the charm might be too advanced for you. Many qualified wizards have
difficulty with it.”
“What does a Patronus look like?” said Harry curiously.
“Each one is unique to the wizard who conjures it.”
“And how do you conjure it?”“With an incantation, which will work only if you are concentrating, with
all your might, on a single, very happy memory.”
Harry cast his mind about for a happy memory. Certainly, nothing that had
happened to him at the Dursleys’ was going to do. Finally, he settled  lf, guilty about his secret desire to
hear his parents’ voices again.
“You’re expecting too much of yourself,” said Professor Lupin sternly in
their fourth week of practice. “For a thirteen-year-old wizard, even an
indistinct Patronus is a huge achievement. You aren’t passing out anymore,
are you?”
“I thought a Patronus would — charge the dementors down or something,”
said Harry dispiritedly. “Make them disappear —”“The true Patronus does do that,” said Lupin. “But you’ve achieved a great
deal in a very short space of time. If the dementors put in an appearance at
your next Quidditch match, you will be able to keep them at bay long enough
to get back to the ground.”
“You said it’s harder if there are loads of them,” said Harry.
“I have complete confidence in you,” said Lupin, smiling. “Here — you’ve
earned a drink — something from the Three Broomsticks. You won’t have
tried it before —”
He pulled two bottles out of his briefcase.
“Butterbeer!” said Harry, without thinking. “Yeah, I like that stuff!”
Lupin rai ad, come on —”
But no one came. Harry raised his head to look at the circle of dementors
across the lake. One of them was lowering its hood. It was time for the
rescuer to appear — but no one was coming to help this time —
And then it hit him — he understood. He hadn’t seen his father — he had
seen 
himself —
Harry flung himself out from behind the bush and pulled out his wand.
“EXPECTO PATRONUM!”
 he yelled.
And out of the end of his wand burst, not a shapeless cloud of mist, but a
blinding, dazzling, silver animal. He screwed up his eyes, trying to see what it
was. It looked like a horse. It was galloping silently away from him, across
the black surface of the lake. He saw it lower its head and charge at the
swarming dementors. . . . Now it was galloping around and around the black
shapes on the ground, and the dementors were falling back, scattering,
retreating into the darkness. . . . They were gone.
The Patronus turned. It was cantering back toward Harry across the still
surface of the water. It wasn’t a"

Harry cast his mind about for a happy memory. Certainly, nothing that had
happened to him at the Dursleys’ was going to do. Finally, he settled   . . . one that he could
turn into a good, strong Patronus . . .
The moment when he’d first found out he was a wizard, and would be
leaving the Dursleys for Hogwarts! If that wasn’t a happy memory, he didn’t
know what was. . . . Concentrating very hard on how he had felt when he’d
realized he’d be leaving Privet Drive, Harry got to his feet and faced the
packing case once more.
“Ready?” said Lupin, who looked as though he were doing this against his
better judgment. “Concentrating hard? All right — go!”
He pulled off the lid of the case for the third time, and the dementor rose
out of it; the room fell cold and dark —
“EXPECTO PATRONUM!”
 Harry bellowed. 
“EXPECTO PATRONUM!
EXPECTO PATRONUM!”
The screaming inside Harry’s head had started again — except this time, it
sounded as though it were coming from a badly tuned radio — softer and
louder and softer again — and he could still see the dementor — it had halted
— and then a huge, silver shadow came bursting out of the end of Harry’s
wand, to hover between hi y something like a
dementor.
“Oh, don’t be such a killjoy,” said Cho brightly, watching her silvery swan-
shaped Patronus soar around the Room of Requirement during their last
lesson before Easter. “They’re so pretty!”
“They’re not supposed to be pretty, they’re supposed to protect you,” said
Harry patiently. “What we really need is a boggart or something; that’s how I
learned, I had to conjure a Patronus while the boggart was pretending to be a
dementor —”
“But that would be really scary!” said Lavender, who was shooting puffs of
silver vapor out of the end of her wand. “And I still — can’t — do it!” she
added angrily.
Neville was having trouble too. His face was screwed up in concentration,
but only feeble wisps of silver smoke issued from his wand-tip.
“You’ve got to think of something happy,” Harry reminded him.
“I’m trying,” said Neville miserably, who was trying so hard his round face
was actually shining with sweat.

never wanted him. Then he returned to the Gaunt hovel, performed the
complex bit of magic that would implant a false memory in his uncle’s mind,
laid Morfin’s wand beside its unconscious owner, pocketed the ancient ring he
wore, and departed.”
“And Morfin never realized he hadn’t done it?”
“Never,” said Dumbledore. “He gave, as I say, a full and boastful
confession.”
“But he had this real memory in him all the time!”
“Yes, but it took a great deal of skilled Legilimency to coax it out of him,”
said Dumbledore, “and why should anybody delve further into Morfin’s mind
when he had already confessed to the crime? However, I was able to secure a
visit to Morfin in the last weeks of his life, by which time I was attempting to
discover as much as I could about Voldemort’s past. I extracted this memory
with difficulty. When I saw what it contained, I attempted to use it to secure
Morfin’s release from Azkaban. Before the Ministry reached their decision,
however, Morfin had died.”
“But how come the Ministr over again, leaving the place where it had been slightly redder than before but
quite smooth.
Harry looked around at Umbridge. She was watching him, her wide,
toadlike mouth stretched in a smile.
“Yes?”
“Nothing,” said Harry quietly.
He looked back at the parchment, placed the quill upon it once more, wrote
I must not tell lies,
 and felt the searing pain on the back of his hand for a
second time; once again the words had been cut into his skin, once again they
healed over seconds later.
And on it went. Again and again Harry wrote the words on the parchment
in what he soon came to realize was not ink, but his own blood. And again
and again the words were cut into the back of his hand, healed, and then
reappeared the next time he set quill to parchment.
Darkness fell outside Umbridge’s window. Harry did not ask when he
would be allowed to stop. He did not even check his watch. He knew she was
watching him for signs of weakness and he was not going to show any, not
even if he had to sit here all night, cutting  sked shakily.
“This? It is called a Pensieve,” said Dumbledore. “I sometimes find, and I
am sure you know the feeling, that I simply have too many thoughts and
memories crammed into my mind.”
“Er,” said Harry, who couldn’t truthfully say that he had ever felt anything
of the sort.
“At these times,” said Dumbledore, indicating the stone basin, “I use the
Pensieve. One simply siphons the excess thoughts from one’s mind, pours
them into the basin, and examines them at one’s leisure. It becomes easier to
spot patterns and links, you understand, when they are in this form.”
“You mean . . . that stuff’s your 
thoughts
?” Harry said, staring at the
swirling white substance in the basin.
“Certainly,” said Dumbledore. “Let me show you.”
Dumbledore drew his wand out of the inside of his robes and placed the tip
into his own silvery hair, near his temple. When he took the wand away, hair
seemed to be clinging to it — but then Harry saw that it was in fact a
glistening strand of the same strange silvery-white substance t"
Who is the head of Hufflepuff House?,Pomona Sprout,"According to the passage, the head of Hufflepuff House is not explicitly mentioned. However, it is mentioned that ""Whitby, Kevin!"" is sorted into Hufflepuff, and Professor McGonagall is the one conducting the Sorting ceremony."," L’s.
“Oh hurry up,” Ron moaned, massaging his stomach.
“Now, Ron, the Sorting’s much more important than food,” said Nearly
Headless Nick as “Madley, Laura!” became a Hufflepuff.“’Course it is, if you’re dead,” snapped Ron.
“I do hope this year’s batch of Gryffindors are up to scratch,” said Nearly
Headless Nick, applauding as “McDonald, Natalie!” joined the Gryffindor
table. “We don’t want to break our winning streak, do we?”
Gryffindor had won the Inter-House Championship for the last three years
in a row.
“Pritchard, Graham!”
“SLYTHERIN!”
“Quirke, Orla!”
“RAVENCLAW!”
And finally, with “Whitby, Kevin!”(“HUFFLEPUFF!”), the Sorting ended.
Professor McGonagall picked up the hat and the stool and carried them away.
“About time,” said Ron, seizing his knife and fork and looking expectantly
at his golden plate.
Professor Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was smiling around at the
students, his arms opened wide in welcome.
“I have only two words to say to you,” he told them, his deep voice echoing
around the  rom a doorway to the right — the
rest of the school must already be here — but Professor McGonagall showed
the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in,
standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering
about nervously.
“Welcome to Hogwarts,” said Professor McGonagall. “The start-of-term

outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs

At the end of the cer in the Muggle world —
everyone follows Quidditch — played up in the air on broomsticks and
there’s four balls — sorta hard ter explain the rules.”
“And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?”
“School Houses. There’s four. Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o’
duffers, but —”
“I bet I’m in Hufflepuff,” said Harry gloomily.
“Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin,” said Hagrid darkly. “There’s not a
single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn’t in Slytherin. You-Know-
Who was one.”
“Vol-, sorry — You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?”
“Years an’ years ago,” said Hagrid.
They bought Harry’s school books in a shop called Flourish and Blotts
where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as paving
stones bound in leather; books the size of postage stamps in covers of silk;
books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with nothing in them at all.
Even Dudley, who never read anything, would have been wild to get his
hands on some of these. Hagrid almost had to drag Harry away from

Hermione whip around. Buckbeak the hippogriff was lying in the corner,
chomping on something that was oozing blood all over the floor.
“I couldn’ leave him tied up out there in the snow!” choked Hagrid. “All on
his own! At Christmas.”
Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another. They had never seen eye
to eye with Hagrid about what he called “interesting creatures” and other
people called “terrifying monsters.” On the other hand, there didn’t seem to
be any particular harm in Buckbeak. In fact, by Hagrid’s usual standards, he
was positively cute.
“You’ll have to put up a good strong defense, Hagrid,” said Hermione,
sitting down and laying a hand on Hagrid’s massive forearm. “I’m sure you
can prove Buckbeak is safe.”
“Won’t make no diff’rence!” sobbed Hagrid. “Them Disposal devils,
they’re all in Lucius Malfoy’s pocket! Scared o’ him! An’ if I lose the case,
Buckbeak —”
Hagrid drew his finger swiftly across his throat, then gave a great wail and
lurched forward, his face in his arms.
“What about h. Buckbeak broke into a grudging trot. They
had reached the trees. . . .
“Quick! Quick!” Hermione moaned, darting out from behind her tree,
seizing the rope too and adding her weight to make Buckbeak move faster.
Harry looked over his shoulder; they were now blocked from sight; they
couldn’t see Hagrid’s garden at all.
“Stop!” he whispered to Hermione. “They might hear us —”
Hagrid’s back door had opened with a bang. Harry, Hermione, and
Buckbeak stood quite still; even the hippogriff seemed to be listening intently.
Silence . . . then —
“Where is it?” said the reedy voice of the Committee member. “Where is
the beast?”
“It was tied here!” said the executioner furiously. “I saw it! Just here!”
“How extraordinary,” said Dumbledore. There was a note of amusement in
his voice.
“Beaky!” said Hagrid huskily.
There was a swishing noise, and the thud of an axe. The executioner
seemed to have swung it into the fence in anger. And then came the howling,
and this time they could hear Hagrid’s words through his sobs.“Go the top of Buckbeak’s wing and hoisted himself onto
its back. Buckbeak stood up. Harry wasn’t sure where to hold on; everything
in front of him was covered with feathers.
“Go on, then!” roared Hagrid, slapping the hippogriff’s hindquarters.
Without warning, twelve-foot wings flapped open on either side of Harry;
he just had time to seize the hippogriff around the neck before he was soaring
upward. It was nothing like a broomstick, and Harry knew which one he
preferred; the hippogriff’s wings beat uncomfortably on either side of him,
catching him under his legs and making him feel he was about to be thrown
off; the glossy feathers slipped under his fingers and he didn’t dare get a
stronger grip; instead of the smooth action of his Nimbus Two Thousand, he
now felt himself rocking backward and forward as the hindquarters of the
hippogriff rose and fell with its wings.
Buckbeak flew him once around the paddock and then headed back to the
ground; this was the bit Harry had been dreading; he leaned back as the

Who is the founder of Gryffindor House?,Godric Gryffindor,"According to the passage, the founder of Gryffindor House is Godric Gryffindor.","ewn,
There lived four wizards of renown,
Whose names are still well known:
Bold Gryffindor, from wild moor,
Fair Ravenclaw, from glen,
Sweet Hufflepuff, from valley broad,
Shrewd Slytherin, from fen.
They shared a wish, a hope, a dream,
They hatched a daring plan
To educate young sorcerers
Thus Hogwarts School began.Now each of these four founders
Formed their own House, for each
Did value different virtues
In the ones they had to teach.
By Gryffindor, the bravest were
Prized far beyond the rest;
For Ravenclaw, the cleverest
Would always be the best;
For Hufflepuff, hard workers were
Most worthy of admission;
And power-hungry Slytherin
Loved those of great ambition.
While still alive they did divide
Their favorites from the throng,
Yet how to pick the worthy ones
When they were dead and gone?
’Twas Gryffindor who found the way,
He whipped me off his head
The founders put some brains in me
So I could choose instead!
Now slip me snug about your ears,
I’ve never yet been wrong,
I’ll have a look inside your mind
 ofessor Binns slowly, “yes, one could argue that, I suppose.”
He peered at Hermione as though he had never seen a student properly before.
“However, the legend of which you speak is such a very 
sensational,
 even
ludicrous
 tale —”
But the whole class was now hanging on Professor Binns’s every word. He
looked dimly at them all, every face turned to his. Harry could tell he was
completely thrown by such an unusual show of interest.
“Oh, very well,” he said slowly. “Let me see . . . the Chamber of
Secrets . . .
“You all know, of course, that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years
ago — the precise date is uncertain — by the four greatest witches and
wizards of the age. The four school Houses are named after them: Godric
Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin.
They built this castle together, far from prying Muggle eyes, for it was an age
when magic was feared by common people, and witches and wizards suffered
much persecution.”
He paused, gazed blearily around the room, and c rom a doorway to the right — the
rest of the school must already be here — but Professor McGonagall showed
the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in,
standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering
about nervously.
“Welcome to Hogwarts,” said Professor McGonagall. “The start-of-term
banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall,
you will be sorted into your Houses. The Sorting is a very importantceremony because, while you are here, your House will be something like
your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your
House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free time in your House
common room.

toward the concealed entrance to the Room of Requirement. As they ran, they
met crowds of students, most wearing traveling cloaks over their pajamas,
being shepherded down to the Great Hall by teachers and prefects.
“That was Potter!”
“Harry Potter!”
“It was him, I swear, I just saw him!”
But Harry did not look back, and at last they reached the entrance to the
Room of Requirement. Harry leaned against the enchanted wall, which
opened to admit them, and he and Luna sped back down the steep staircase.
“Wh — ?”
As the room came into view, Harry slipped down a few stairs in shock. It
was packed, far more crowded than when he had last been in there. Kingsley
and Lupin were looking up at him, as were Oliver Wood, Katie Bell, Angelina
Johnson and Alicia Spinnet, Bill and Fleur, and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley.
“Harry, what’s happening?” said Lupin, meeting him at the foot of the
stairs.
“Voldemort’s on his way, they’re barricading the school — Snape’s run for
it — What are you doing here? How did you know?”

At the end of the schools. He supposed, now that he saw representatives of so many
nationalities in the campsite, that he had been stupid never to realize that
Hogwarts couldn’t be the only one. He glanced at Hermione, who looked
utterly unsurprised by the information. No doubt she had run across the news
about other Wizarding schools in some book or other.
“You’ve been ages,” said George when they finally got back to the
Weasleys’ tents.
“Met a few people,” said Ron, setting the water down. “You not got that
fire started yet?”
“Dad’s having fun with the matches,” said Fred.Mr. Weasley was having no success at all in lighting the fire, but it wasn’t
for lack of trying. Splintered matches littered the ground around him, but he
looked as though he was having the time of his life.
“Oops!” he said as he managed to light a match and promptly dropped it in
surprise.
“Come here, Mr. Weasley,” said Hermione kindly, taking the box from him,
and showing him how to do it properly.
At last they got the fire lit, though it was at least ano"
