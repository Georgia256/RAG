sniggered, but Slughorn showed no dismay; on the contrary, he beamed and
looked from Hermione to Harry, who was sitting next to her.
“Oho! 
‘One of my best friends is Muggle-born, and she’s the best in our
year!’
 I’m assuming this is the very friend of whom you spoke, Harry?”
“Yes, sir,” said Harry.
“Well, well, take twenty well-earned points for Gryffindor, Miss Granger,”
said Slughorn genially.
Malfoy looked rather as he had done the time Hermione had punched him
in the face. Hermione turned to Harry wi e three Weasley boys, Harry, Hermione, and Ginny.
“All these yours, Arthur?”
“Oh no, only the redheads,” said Mr. Weasley, pointing out his children.
“This is Hermione, friend of Ron’s — and Harry, another friend —”
“Merlin’s beard,” said Amos Diggory, his eyes widening. “Harry? Harry
Potter
?”
“Er — yeah,” said Harry.
Harry was used to people looking curiously at him when they met him,
used to the way their eyes moved at once to the lightning scar on his forehead,
but it always made him feel uncomfortable. . Again, your readers will have to buy my book for the
whole story, but there is no question that Dumbledore took an unnatural
interest in Potter from the word go. Whether that was really in the boy’s
best interests — well, we’ll see. It’s certainly an open secret that Potter
has had a most troubled adolescence.”
I ask whether Skeeter is still in touch with Harry Potter, whom she so
famously interviewed last year: a breakthrough piece in which Potter
spoke exclusively of his conviction that You-Know-Who had say you remember him at Hogwarts, Rosmerta,” murmured Professor
McGonagall. “Do you remember who his best friend was?”
“Naturally,” said Madam Rosmerta, with a small laugh. “Never saw one
without the other, did you? The number of times I had them in here — ooh,
they used to make me laugh. Quite the double act, Sirius Black and James
Potter!”
Harry dropped his tankard with a loud clunk. Ron kicked him.
“Precisely,” said Professor McGonagall. “Black and Potter. Ringleaders of
their little gang. Both very brig  realize who this is?” said Firenze. “This is the Potter boy. The
quicker he leaves this forest, the better.”
“What have you been telling him?” growled Bane. “Remember, Firenze,
we are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens. Have we not read what
is to come in the movements of the planets?”
Ronan pawed the ground nervously. “I’m sure Firenze thought he was
acting for the best,” he said in his gloomy voice.
Bane kicked his back legs in anger.
“For the best! What is that to do with us? Centaurs are co ting from the egg in Filch’s arms to the
map in Moody’s hand, and Harry could tell he was putting two and two
together, as only Snape could. . . .
“Potter,” he said quietly.
“What’s that?” said Moody calmly, folding up the map and pocketing it.
“Potter!” Snape snarled, and he actually turned his head and stared right at
the place where Harry was, as though he could suddenly see him. “That egg is
Potter’s egg. That piece of parchment belongs to Potter. I have seen it before,
I recognize it! Potter is here! P he’s still —”
“He’s not a child!” said Sirius impatiently.
“He’s not an adult either!” said Mrs. Weasley, the color rising in her
cheeks. “He’s not 
James, 
Sirius!”
“I’m perfectly clear who he is, thanks, Molly,” said Sirius coldly.
“I’m not sure you are!” said Mrs. Weasley. “Sometimes, the way you talk
about him, it’s as though you think you’ve got your best friend back!”
“What’s wrong with that?” said Harry.
“What’s wrong, Harry, is that you are 
not
 your father, however much you
might look like him!” s"

down the living room, “we — Petunia, Dudley, and I — are in danger. From

“Some of ‘my lot,’ right,” said Harry.
“Well, I don’t believe it,” repeated Uncle Vernon, coming to a halt in front
of Harry again. “I was awake half the night thinking it all over, and I believe
it’s a plot to get the house.”
“The house?” repeated Harry. “What house?”

four-legged stool out of the hall.
“Oh,” said Hermione softly, “we’ve missed the Sorting!”
New students at Hogwarts were sorted into Houses by trying on the Sorting
Hat, which shouted out the House they were best suited to (Gryffindor,
Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, or Slytherin). Professor McGonagall strode off toward
her empty seat at the staff table, and Harry and Hermione set off in the other
direction, as quietly as possible, toward the Gry rom a doorway to the right — the
rest of the school must already be here — but Professor McGonagall showed
the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in,
standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering
about nervously.
“Welcome to Hogwarts,” said Professor McGonagall. “The start-of-term
banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall,
you will be sorted into your Houses. The Sorting is a very importantceremony because, while pened behind Harry. A woman spoke, and the
sound of the voice wound Harry’s fear to an even higher pitch.
“What is this? What’s happened, Cissy?”
Bellatrix Lestrange walked slowly around the prisoners, and stopped on
Harry’s right, staring at Hermione through her heavily lidded eyes.
“But surely,” she said quietly, “this is the Mudblood girl? This is Granger?”
“Yes, yes, it’s Granger!” cried Lucius. “And beside her, we think, Potter!
Potter and his friends, caught at last!”
“Potter?” shrieked Bellatrix, and patiently, who had

“‘Got Potter’?” said Professor McGonagall sharply. “What do you mean,

What is the name of Harry Potter's owl?,Hedwig,"According to the context, the name of Harry Potter's owl is not mentioned. However, in this scene, Ron is considering keeping the owl that Sirius Black sent, which is described as a ""minute owl"" and is later referred to as an owl.","k at Sirius’s letter.
“Hang on, there’s a P.S. . . .”
I thought your friend Ron might like to keep this owl, as it’s my fault
he no longer has a rat.
Ron’s eyes widened. The minute owl was still hooting excitedly.
“Keep him?” he said uncertainly. He looked closely at the owl for a
moment; then, to Harry’s and Hermione’s great surprise, he held him out for
Crookshanks to sniff.
“What d’you reckon?” Ron asked the cat. “Definitely an owl?”Crookshanks purred.
“That’s good enough for me,” said Ron happily. “He’s  as though a large balloon was
swelling inside him. He went straight to the window and jerked it open. The
owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of Hagrid, who didn’t
wake up. The owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to attack Hagrid’scoat.
“Don’t do that.”
Harry tried to wave the owl out of the way, but it snapped its beak fiercely

The Keeper of the Keys  morning. 
He
 didn’t see the owls swooping past in broad daylight, though
people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl
after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl even at
nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning.
He yelled at five different people. He made several important telephone calls
and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he
thought he’d stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy hims ting from the egg in Filch’s arms to the
map in Moody’s hand, and Harry could tell he was putting two and two
together, as only Snape could. . . .
“Potter,” he said quietly.
“What’s that?” said Moody calmly, folding up the map and pocketing it.
“Potter!” Snape snarled, and he actually turned his head and stared right at
the place where Harry was, as though he could suddenly see him. “That egg is
Potter’s egg. That piece of parchment belongs to Potter. I have seen it before,
I recognize it! Potter is here! P He
brought it carefully inside. The owl dropped its letter onto Harry’s seat and
began zooming around their compartment, apparently very pleased with itself
for accomplishing its task. Hedwig clicked her beak with a sort of dignified
disapproval. Crookshanks sat up in his seat, following the owl with his great
yellow eyes. Ron, noticing this, snatched the owl safely out of harm’s way.
Harry picked up the letter. It was addressed to him. He ripped open the
letter, and shouted, “It’s from Sirius!”
“What?” sai sick of finding everything out from the
Slytherins.”
“Good thinking!” said Harry, also looking up at the owls. “Hey, Hermione,
I think you’re in luck —”
A gray owl was soaring down toward Hermione.“It hasn’t got a newspaper, though,” she said, looking disappointed. “It’s
—”
But to her bewilderment, the gray owl landed in front of her plate, closely
followed by four barn owls, a brown owl, and a tawny.
“How many subscriptions did you take out?” said Harry, seizing
Hermione’s goblet before it was knocked over"
Who is the headmaster of Hogwarts?,Albus Dumbledore,"According to the text, Severus Snape has been confirmed as the new Headmaster of Hogwarts."," the Hogwarts Express to come
tomorrow if necessary —”
“What about Dumbledore’s funeral?” said Harry, speaking at last.
“Well . . .” said Professor McGonagall, losing a little of her briskness as her
voice shook. “I — I know that it was Dumbledore’s wish to be laid to rest
here, at Hogwarts —”
“Then that’s what’ll happen, isn’t it?” said Harry fiercely.
“If the Ministry thinks it appropriate,” said Professor McGonagall. “No
other headmaster or headmistress has ever been —”
“No other headmaster or headmistre red
parchment.
A large picture of a familiar, hook-nosed, black-haired man stared up at
them all, beneath a headline that read:
SEVERUS SNAPE CONFIRMED AS HOGWARTS HEADMASTER
“No!” said Ron and Hermione loudly.
Hermione was quickest; she snatched up the newspaper and began to read
the accompanying story out loud.
“‘Severus Snape, long-standing Potions master at Hogwarts School of
Witchcraft and Wizardry, was today appointed headmaster in the most
important of several staffing changes at the ancient school.  he had just been appointed Head Boy. Harry didn’t realize what he was so
pleased about until the Potions lesson about two weeks after Dumbledore and
Hagrid had left, when, sitting right behind Malfoy, Harry overheard him
gloating to Crabbe and Goyle.
“I always thought Father might be the one who got rid of Dumbledore,” he
said, not troubling to keep his voice down. “I told you he thinks
Dumbledore’s the worst headmaster the school’s ever had. Maybe we’ll get a
decent headmaster now. Someone who won’t 
want
  be able to
come to Hogwarts. Other parents weren’t likely to want their children
exposed to me.
“But then Dumbledore became headmaster, and he was sympathetic. He
said that as long as we took certain precautions, there was no reason I
shouldn’t come to school. . . .” Lupin sighed, and looked directly at Harry. “I
told you, months ago, that the Whomping Willow was planted the year I came
to Hogwarts. The truth is that it was planted 
because
 I came to Hogwarts.
This house” — 
Lupin looked miserably around  werewolf Remus Lupin, half-giant Rubeus Hagrid, and delusional
ex-Auror ‘Mad-Eye’ Moody.
“Rumors abound, of course, that Albus Dumbledore, once Supreme
Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards and Chief Warlock
of the Wizengamot, is no longer up to the task of managing the prestigious
school of Hogwarts.
“‘I think the appointment of the Inquisitor is a first step toward ensuring
that Hogwarts has a headmaster in whom we can all repose confidence,’ said
a Ministry insider last night.
“Wizengamot  at Hogwarts,” said Harry. “I mean, there’s Dumbledore, for one
thing — you know who Dumbledore is, don’t you?”
Dobby bowed his head.
“Albus Dumbledore is the greatest headmaster Hogwarts has ever had.
Dobby knows it, sir. Dobby has heard Dumbledore’s powers rival those of
He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named at the height of his strength. But, sir” —
Dobby’s voice dropped to an urgent whisper — “there are powers
Dumbledore doesn’t . . . powers no decent wizard . . .”
And before Harry could stop him, Dobby bounded off  d was headmaster, not Dumbledore, and he, Harry, was
little more than a phantom, completely invisible to the people of fifty years
ago.
There was a knock on the office door.
“Enter,” said the old wizard in a feeble voice.
A boy of about sixteen entered, taking off his pointed hat. A silver prefect’s
badge was glinting on his chest. He was much taller than Harry, but he, too,
had jet-black hair.
“Ah, Riddle,” said the headmaster.“You wanted to see me, Professor Dippet?” said Riddle. He looked
nervous.
“Sit d ersonally!
Lots of love,
Snape took the page bearing Lily’s signature, and her love, and tucked it
inside his robes. Then he ripped in two the photograph he was also holding,
so that he kept the part from which Lily laughed, throwing the portion
showing James and Harry back onto the floor, under the chest of drawers. . . .
And now Snape stood again in the headmaster’s study as Phineas Nigellus
came hurrying into his portrait.
“Headmaster! They are camping in the Forest of Dean! The Mudblood —”
“Do not use t"
What spell is used to disarm an opponent?,Expelliarmus,"The spell used to disarm an opponent is not explicitly stated in this passage. However, it is implied that the students are supposed to cast a ""Disarm"" spell, which would cause their opponent's wand to fly out of their hand."," Slytherin girl who
reminded Harry of a picture he’d seen in 
Holidays with Hags.
 She was large
and square and her heavy jaw jutted aggressively. Hermione gave her a weak
smile that she did not return.
“Face your partners!” called Lockhart, back on the platform. “And bow!”
Harry and Malfoy barely inclined their heads, not taking their eyes off each
other.
“Wands at the ready!” shouted Lockhart. “When I count to three, cast your
charms to Disarm your opponents — 
only
 to disarm them — we don’t want

Anthony Goldstein, his own wand would fly out of his hand, yet Anthony did
not seem to be making a sound. Harry did not have to look far for the solution
of the mystery, however; Fred and George were several feet from Smith and
taking it in turns to point their wands at his back.
“Sorry, Harry,” said George hastily, when Harry caught his eye. “Couldn’t
resist . . .”
Harry walked around the other pairs, trying to correct those who were
doing the spell wrong. Ginny was teamed with Michael Corner; s idents — one . . . two . . . three —”
Harry swung his wand high, but Malfoy had already started on “two”: His
spell hit Harry so hard he felt as though he’d been hit over the head with a
saucepan. He stumbled, but everything still seemed to be working, and
wasting no more time, Harry pointed his wand straight at Malfoy and shouted,
“Rictusempra!”A jet of silver light hit Malfoy in the stomach and he doubled up, wheezing.
“I said Disarm only!”
 Lockhart shouted in alarm over the heads of the
battling crowd,  y just remembered.
“What?” said Ron and Hermione together.
“My dad used this spell,” said Harry. “I — Lupin told me.”
This last part was not true; in fact, Harry had seen his father use the spell
on Snape, but he had never told Ron and Hermione about that particular
excursion into the Pensieve. Now, however, a wonderful possibility occurred
to him. Could the Half-Blood Prince possibly be — ?
“Maybe your dad did use it, Harry,” said Hermione, “but he’s not the only
one. We’ve seen a whole bunch of people use it before — I DID IT!”
“Good one!” said Harry encouragingly, deciding not to point out that in a
real duel situation Neville’s opponent was unlikely to be staring in the
opposite direction with his wand held loosely at his side. “Listen, Neville, can
you take it in turns to practice with Ron and Hermione for a couple of minutes
so I can walk around and see how the rest are doing?”
Harry moved off into the middle of the room. Something very odd was
happening to Zacharias Smith; every time he opened his mouth mione were on their feet, all three of them having used a
different hex. Nor were they the only ones to have done so.
“Thought we’d see what those three were up to,” said Fred matter-of-factly,
stepping onto Goyle and into the compartment. He had his wand out, and so
did George, who was careful to tread on Malfoy as he followed Fred inside.
“Interesting effect,” said George, looking down at Crabbe. “Who used the
Furnunculus Curse?”
“Me,” said Harry.
“Odd,” said George lightly. “I used Jelly-Legs. Looks as t nd held at the ready.
“Stand up and take out your wand, Potter.”
Harry got to his feet feeling nervous. They faced each other with the desk
between them.
“You may use your wand to attempt to disarm me, or defend yourself inany other way you can think of,” said Snape.
“And what are you going to do?” Harry asked, eyeing Snape’s wand
apprehensively.
“I am about to attempt to break into your mind,” said Snape softly. “We are
going to see how well you resist. I have been told that you have already
shown aptitude rmitories: the Hufflepuffs to the basement corridor that also led to the
kitchens, the Ravenclaws to a tower on the west side of the castle, and the
Gryffindors along the corridor to the seventh floor and the Fat Lady’s portrait.
“That was really, really good, Harry,” said Hermione, when finally it was
just her, Harry, and Ron left.
“Yeah, it was!” said Ron enthusiastically, as they slipped out of the door
and watched it melt back into stone behind them. “Did you see me disarm
Hermione, Harry?”“Only once,” "
Who teaches Potions at Hogwarts?,Severus Snape,"According to the text, Professor Snape teaches Potions at Hogwarts.","We are also looking for new
Quidditch commentators, who should do likewise.
“We are pleased to welcome a new member of staff this year. Professor
Slughorn” — Slughorn stood up, his bald head gleaming in the candlelight,
his big waistcoated belly casting the table below into shadow — “is a former
colleague of mine who has agreed to resume his old post of Potions master.”
“Potions?”
“Potions?”
The word echoed all over the Hall as people wondered whether they had
heard right.
“Potions?” said Ron and Hermione t “Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder he’s looking so
nervous, that’s Professor Snape. He teaches Potions, but he doesn’t want to —
everyone knows he’s after Quirrell’s job. Knows an awful lot about the Dark
Arts, Snape.”
Harry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn’t look at him again.
At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to his
feet again. The hall fell silent.
“Ahem — just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I
have a few start-of-term notice  how come these girls
are able to bring love potions into school?”
“Fred and George send them disguised as perfumes and cough potions,”
said Hermione. “It’s part of their Owl Order Service.”
“You know a lot about it.”
Hermione gave him the kind of nasty look she had just given his copy of
Advanced Potion-Making.
“It was all on the back of the bottles they showed Ginny and me in the
summer,” she said coldly. “I don’t go around putting potions in people’s
drinks . . . or pretending to, either, which is just a hed her essay on 
The Principles of Rematerialization
 away from Ron,
who was trying to read it upside down.
Harry looked at his watch and hurriedly put the old copy of 
Advanced
Potion-Making
 back into his bag.
“It’s five to eight, I’d better go, I’ll be late for Dumbledore.”
“Ooooh!” gasped Hermione, looking up at once. “Good luck! We’ll wait
up, we want to hear what he teaches you!”
“Hope it goes okay,” said Ron, and the pair of them watched Harry leave
through the portrait hole.
Harry proceeded through rts, except now it’s just the Dark Arts. We’re supposed to practice the
Cruciatus Curse on people who’ve earned detentions —”
“What?”
Harry, Ron, and Hermione’s united voices echoed up and down the
passage.
“Yeah,” said Neville. “That’s how I got this one,” he pointed at a
particularly deep gash in his cheek, “I refused to do it. Some people are into
it, though; Crabbe and Goyle love it. First time they’ve ever been top in
anything, I expect.
“Alecto, Amycus’s sister, teaches Muggle Studies, which is compul very important!” said Hermione, shocked.
“Not the way Lockhart teaches it,” said Ron. “I haven’t learned anything
from him except not to set pixies loose.”
Neville Longbottom had been sent letters from all the witches and wizards
in his family, all giving him different advice on what to choose. Confused and
worried, he sat reading the subject lists with his tongue poking out, asking
people whether they thought Arithmancy sounded more difficult than Study
of Ancient Runes. Dean Thomas, who, like Harry, had g he teaches?” said Ron, frowning at Professor Lupin’s pallid
profile.
“That’s obvious,” whispered Hermione. “There’s only one vacancy, isn’t
there? Defense Against the Dark Arts.”
Harry, Ron, and Hermione had already had two Defense Against the Dark
Arts teachers, both of whom had lasted only one year. There were rumors that
the job was jinxed.
“Well, I hope he’s up to it,” said Ron doubtfully. “He looks like one good
hex would finish him off, doesn’t he? Anyway . . .” He turned to Harry.
“What were you goin y, one Potions class, “for all those
people who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas because they’re not
wanted at home.”
He was looking over at Harry as he spoke. Crabbe and Goyle chuckled.
Harry, who was measuring out powdered spine of lionfish, ignored them.
Malfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since the Quidditch match.
Disgusted that the Slytherins had lost, he had tried to get everyone laughing at
how a wide-mouthed tree frog would be replacing Harry as Seeker next. Thenhe’d realized that"

of Harry again. “I was awake half the night thinking it all over, and I believe

“The house?” repeated Harry. “What house?”
“

pulse. “

At the end of the s!”
The grave was extremely old, weathered so that Harry could hardly make
out the name. Hermione showed him the symbol beneath it.
“Harry, that’s the mark in the book!”
He peered at the place she indicated: The stone was so worn that it was
hard to make out what was engraved there, though there did seem to be a
triangular mark beneath the nearly illegible name.
“Yeah . . . it could be. . . .”
Hermione lit her wand and pointed it at the name on the headstone.
“It says Ig
 — 
Ignotus, I think. . . .”
“I’m go ised. “Why us?”
“I shall tell you that when we are somewhere more private,” said
Scrimgeour. “Is there such a place?” he demanded of Mr. Weasley.
“Yes, of course,” said Mr. Weasley, who looked nervous. “The, er, sitting
room, why don’t you use that?”
“You can lead the way,” Scrimgeour said to Ron. “There will be no need
for you to accompany us, Arthur.”
Harry saw Mr. Weasley exchange a worried look with Mrs. Weasley as he,Ron, and Hermione stood up. As they led the way back to the house in
silence, Harry kn as been
selected by the Goblet of Fire, he or she is obliged to see the tournament
through to the end. The placing of your name in the goblet constitutes a

become a champion. Please be very sure, therefore, that you are
wholeheartedly prepared to play before you drop your name into the goblet.
Now, I think it is time for bed. Good night to you all.”
“An Age Line!” Fred Weasley said, his eyes glinting, as they all made their
way across  and Uncle Vernon
hated having Harry in the house. To give himself thinking time, it seemed, he
looked down at Mrs. Weasley’s letter again.“Who is this woman?” he said, staring at the signature with distaste.
“You’ve seen her,” said Harry. “She’s my friend Ron’s mother, she was
meeting him off the Hog — off the school train at the end of last term.”
He had almost said “Hogwarts Express,” and that was a sure way to get his
uncle’s temper up. Nobody ever mentioned the name of Harry’s school aloud
in the Dursle d.
“Yes, he is. As a matter of fact, he’s a tiny bit late. . . . He said he’d be back
around midnight. . . .”
She turned to look at a large clock that was perched awkwardly on top of a
pile of sheets in the washing basket at the end of the table. Harry recognized it
at once: It had nine hands, each inscribed with the name of a family member,
and usually hung on the Weasleys’ sitting room wall, though its current
position suggested that Mrs. Weasley had taken to carrying it around the
house with her. Every s"

The Keeper of the Keys at were they after, do you think?”
“Information on the Order, if it was Snape.”
“But you’d think he’d already have all he needed, I mean, he was 
in 
the
Order, wasn’t he?”
“Well then,” said Harry, keen to discuss his theory, “what about
information on Dumbledore? The second page of this letter, for instance. You
know this Bathilda my mum mentions, you know who she is?”
“Who?”
“Bathilda Bagshot, the author of —”
“
A History of Magic,
” said Hermione, looking interested. “So your parents
knew her? She was an ould never talk to Rita Skeeter!” whispered Doge.
“Bathilda Bagshot?” Harry said. “The author of 
A History of Magic
?”
The name was printed on the front of one of Harry’s textbooks, though
admittedly not one of the ones he had read most attentively.
“Yes,” said Doge, clutching at Harry’s question like a drowning man at a
life belt. “A most gifted magical historian and an old friend of Albus’s.”
“Quite gaga these days, I’ve heard,” said Auntie Muriel cheerfully.
“If that is so, it is even more dishonorable  y short, and looked as though it had been scrawled in a
great hurry. Harry read it aloud:
Harry —
I’m flying north immediately. This news about your scar is the
latest in a series of strange rumors that have reached me here. If it
hurts again, go straight to Dumbledore — they’re saying he’s got
Mad-Eye out of retirement, which means he’s reading the signs,
even if no one else is.
I’ll be in touch soon. My best to Ron and Hermione. Keep your
eyes open, Harry.
Harry looked up at Ron and Hermione, who stared b  but there was no answer.
“He’s not out, is he?” said Hermione, who was shivering under her cloak.
Ron had his ear to the door.
“There’s a weird noise,” he said. “Listen — is that Fang?”
Harry and Hermione put their ears to the door too. From inside the cabincame a series of low, throbbing moans.
“Think we’d better go and get someone?” said Ron nervously.
“Hagrid!” called Harry, thumping the door. “Hagrid, are you in there?”
There was a sound of heavy footsteps, then the door creaked open. Hagrid
stood ther

be the first to go, now the Dark Lord’s back! Mudbloods and Muggle-lovers
first! Well — second — Diggory was the f —”
It was as though someone had exploded a box of fireworks within the
compartment. Blinded by the blaze of the spells that had blasted from every
direction, deafened by a series of bangs, Harry blinked and looked down at
the floor.
Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle were all lying unconscious in the doorway. He,
Ron, and Her oduced him to the wizards on
either side of him.
“Harry Potter, you know,” he told the Bulgarian minister loudly, who was
wearing splendid robes of black velvet trimmed with gold and didn’t seem to
understand a word of English. “
Harry Potter
 . . . oh come on now, you know
who he is . . . the boy who survived You-Know-Who . . . you 
do
 know who he
is —”
The Bulgarian wizard suddenly spotted Harry’s scar and started gabbling
loudly and excitedly, pointing at it.
“Knew we’d get there in the end,” said Fudge ewolf attacks.”
The bell rang and Lockhart got to his feet.“Homework — compose a poem about my defeat of the Wagga Wagga
Werewolf! Signed copies of 
Magical Me
 to the author of the best one!”
The class began to leave. Harry returned to the back of the room, where
Ron and Hermione were waiting.
“Ready?” Harry muttered.
“Wait till everyone’s gone,” said Hermione nervously. “All right . . .”
She approached Lockhart’s desk, a piece of paper clutched tightly in her
hand, Harry and Ron right behind her.

What platform do students use to board the Hogwarts Express?,Platform 9 3/4,"According to the text, students use Platform 9 3/4 to board the Hogwarts Express.","ough onto
platform nine and three quarters, where the Hogwarts Express stood belching
sooty steam over a platform packed with departing students and their families.Harry inhaled the familiar smell and felt his spirits soar. . . . He was really
going back. . . .
“I hope the others make it in time,” said Mrs. Weasley anxiously, staring
behind her at the wrought-iron arch spanning the platform, through which
new arrivals would come.
“Nice dog, Harry!” called a tall boy with dreadlocks.
“Thanks, Lee,” said Harr ty 125
that had just arrived at platform nine. With a meaningful look at Harry, he
leaned casually against the barrier. Harry imitated him.
In a moment, they had fallen sideways through the solid metal onto
platform nine and three-quarters and looked up to see the Hogwarts Express, a
scarlet steam engine, puffing smoke over a platform packed with witches and
wizards seeing their children onto the train.
Percy and Ginny suddenly appeared behind Harry. They were panting and
had apparently taken the barrier at dumped Harry’s
trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him. Harry thought this
was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, facing the platforms
with a nasty grin on his face.
“Well, there you are, boy. Platform nine — platform ten. Your platform
should be somewhere in the middle, but they don’t seem to have built it yet,
do they?”
He was quite right, of course. There was a big plastic number nine over one
platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it, and in the
middle, can walk, thanks,” said Harry irritably, jerking his arm out of the Auror’s
grip. He pushed his trolley directly at the solid barrier, ignoring his silent
companion, and found himself, a second later, standing on platform nine and
three-quarters, where the scarlet Hogwarts Express stood belching steam over
the crowd.
Hermione and the Weasleys joined him within seconds. Without waiting to
consult his grim-faced Auror, Harry motioned to Ron and Hermione to follow
him up the platform, looking for an empty comp 
It didn’t come . . . he kept on running . . . he opened his eyes.
A scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people.
A sign overhead said Hogwarts Express, eleven o’clock. Harry looked behind
him and saw a wrought-iron archway where the barrier had been, with the
words 
Platform Nine and Three-Quarters
 on it. He had done it.
Smoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd,while cats of every color wound here and there between their legs. Owls
hooted to one anoth and all too soon, the Hogwarts
Express was pulling in at platform nine and three-quarters. The usual
confusion and noise filled the corridors as the students began to disembark.Ron and Hermione struggled out past Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, carrying
their trunks. Harry, however, stayed put.
“Fred — George — wait a moment.”
The twins turned. Harry pulled open his trunk and drew out his Triwizard
winnings.
“Take it,” he said, and he thrust the sack into George’s hands.
“What?” said Fred, looking flabbergasted. students forward for their traditional
journey across the lake.
“All righ’, you three?” Hagrid yelled over the heads of the crowd. They
waved at him, but had no chance to speak to him because the mass of people
around them was shunting them away along the platform. Harry, Ron, and
Hermione followed the rest of the school along the platform and out onto a
rough mud track, where at least a hundred stagecoaches awaited the
remaining students, each pulled, Harry could only assume, by an invisible
horse, because side, they pushed the second trolley forward, gathering speed. As
they reached the barrier, Albus winced, but no collision came. Instead, the
family emerged onto platform nine and three-quarters, which was obscured by
thick white steam that was pouring from the scarlet Hogwarts Express.
Indistinct figures were swarming through the mist, into which James had
already disappeared.
“Where are they?” asked Albus anxiously, peering at the hazy forms they
passed as they made their way down the platform.

What is the name of Harry's godfather?,Sirius Black,The name of Harry's godfather is Sirius Black.," Harry bid him
and Hermione good-bye, then wheeled the trolley bearing his trunk and
Hedwig’s cage toward Uncle Vernon, who greeted him in his usual fashion.
“What’s that?” he snarled, staring at the envelope Harry was still clutching
in his hand. “If it’s another form for me to sign, you’ve got another —”
“It’s not,” said Harry cheerfully. “It’s a letter from my godfather.”
“Godfather?” spluttered Uncle Vernon. “You haven’t got a godfather!”
“Yes, I have,” said Harry brightly. “He was my mum and dad’s best rs of his name rearranged
themselves:
I AM LORD VOLDEMORT
“You see?” he whispered. “It was a name I was already using at Hogwarts,
to my most intimate friends only, of course. You think I was going to use my
filthy Muggle father’s name forever? I, in whose veins runs the blood of
Salazar Slytherin himself, through my mother’s side? I, keep the name of a
foul, common Muggle, who abandoned me even before I was born, just
because he found out his wife was a witch? No, Harry — I fashioned myself a
new name, a n an old badge that

 CEDRIC DIGGORY
 and 
POTTER STINKS,
a cracked and worn-out Sneakoscope, and a gold locket inside which a note
signed R.A.B. had been hidden, he finally discovered the sharp edge that had
done the damage. He recognized it at once. It was a two-inch-long fragment
of the enchanted mirror that his dead godfather, Sirius, had given him. Harry
laid it aside and felt cautiously around the trunk for the rest, but nothing more
remained of his godfather’s last gif s!”
The grave was extremely old, weathered so that Harry could hardly make
out the name. Hermione showed him the symbol beneath it.
“Harry, that’s the mark in the book!”
He peered at the place she indicated: The stone was so worn that it was
hard to make out what was engraved there, though there did seem to be a
triangular mark beneath the nearly illegible name.
“Yeah . . . it could be. . . .”
Hermione lit her wand and pointed it at the name on the headstone.
“It says Ig
 — 
Ignotus, I think. . . .”
“I’m go ius; it had been painful enough to hear Uncle
Vernon say “His godfather’s dead?” and even worse to hear Sirius’s name
thrown out casually by Slughorn.
“It was cruel,” said Dumbledore softly, “that you and Sirius had such a
short time together. A brutal ending to what should have been a long and
happy relationship.”
Harry nodded, his eyes fixed resolutely on the spider now climbing
Dumbledore’s hat. He could tell that Dumbledore understood, that he might
even suspect that until his letter arrived, Harry had  us had collapsed trying to fend off a hundred
dementors. . . .
The sun had fallen before he realized that he was cold. He got up and
returned to the castle, wiping his face on his sleeve as he went.
Ron and Hermione left the hospital wing completely cured three days before
the end of term. Hermione showed signs of wanting to talk about Sirius, but
Ron tended to make hushing noises every time she mentioned his name.
Harry was not sure whether or not he wanted to talk about his godfather yet;
his wishes varie for me. I used your
name but told them to take the gold from Gringotts vault number seven
hundred and eleven — my own. Please consider it as thirteen birthdays’
worth of presents from your godfather.
I would also like to apologize for the fright I think I gave you that
night last year when you left your uncle’s house. I had only hoped to get
a glimpse of you before starting my journey north, but I think the sight of
me alarmed you.
I am enclosing something else for you, which I think will make your
next yea is godfather . . . and now the post owls would never bring him
that comfort again. . . .
“Sirius represented much to you that you had never known before,” said
Dumbledore gently. “Naturally, the loss is devastating. . . .”
“But while I was at the Dursleys’ . . .” interrupted Harry, his voice growing
stronger, “I realized I can’t shut myself away or — or crack up. Sirius
wouldn’t have wanted that, would he? And anyway, life’s too short. . . . Look
at Madam Bones, look at Emmeline Vance. . . . It could be me "
Who is the gamekeeper at Hogwarts?,Rubeus Hagrid,The gamekeeper at Hogwarts is Rubeus Hagrid.,"the Dark Arts, a decision that caused many raised eyebrows
at the Ministry of Magic, given Moody’s well-known habit of
attacking anybody who makes a sudden movement in his presence.
Mad-Eye Moody, however, looks responsible and kindly when set
beside the part-human Dumbledore employs to teach Care ofMagical Creatures.
Rubeus Hagrid, who admits to being expelled from Hogwarts in
his third year, has enjoyed the position of gamekeeper at the school
ever since, a job secured for him by Dumbledore. Last year,
ho hose friends of Harry Potter’s who are
suffering for their allegiance?” Lee was saying.
“Well, as regular listeners will know, several of the more outspoken
supporters of Harry Potter have now been imprisoned, including Xenophilius
Lovegood, erstwhile editor of 
The Quibbler
,” said Lupin.
“At least he’s still alive!” muttered Ron.
“We have also heard within the last few hours that Rubeus Hagrid” — all
three of them gasped, and so nearly missed the rest of the sentence — “well-
known gamekeeper at Hogwarts  is hood up.”
Harry sank down next to the bowl of peas.
“What did you talk to him about, Hagrid? Did you mention Hogwarts at
all?”
“Mighta come up,” said Hagrid, frowning as he tried to remember.
“Yeah . . . he asked what I did, an’ I told him I was gamekeeper here. . . . He
asked a bit about the sorta creatures I look after . . . so I told him . . . an’ I said
what I’d always really wanted was a dragon . . . an’ then . . . I can’ remember
too well, ’cause he kept buyin’ me drinks. . . . Let’s see . . . yeah  up, I can tell you. Our
kind have to keep putting spells on Muggles who’ve spotted them, to make
them forget.”
“So what on earth’s Hagrid up to?” said Hermione.
When they knocked on the door of the gamekeeper’s hut an hour later, they
were surprised to see that all the curtains were closed. Hagrid called “Who is
it?” before he let them in, and then shut the door quickly behind them.
It was stifling hot inside. Even though it was such a warm day, there was a
blazing fire in the grate. Hagrid made them tea a  Hogwarts
gamekeeper, Hagrid.
Dobby blinked anxiously up at Harry.
“Harry Potter mustn’t be angry. . . . Dobby hoped . . . if Harry Potter
thought his friends had forgotten him . . . Harry Potter might not want to go
back to school, sir. . . .”
Harry wasn’t listening. He made a grab for the letters, but Dobby jumpedout of reach.
“Harry Potter will have them, sir, if he gives Dobby his word that he will
not return to Hogwarts. Ah, sir, this is a danger you must not face! Say you
won’t go back, sir!”
“No,” sa s me mum . . . well,
anyway. ’Course, I never was great shakes at magic, really . . . but at least he
never saw me expelled. Died, see, in me second year. . . .
“Dumbledore was the one who stuck up for me after Dad went. Got me the
gamekeeper job . . . trusts people, he does. Gives ’em second chances . . .
tha’s what sets him apar’ from other Heads, see. He’ll accept anyone at
Hogwarts, s’long as they’ve got the talent. Knows people can turn out okay
even if their families weren’ . . . well . . . all tha’ r w. Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two
large ice creams to show he couldn’t come in.
“That’s Hagrid,” said Harry, pleased to know something the boy didn’t.
“He works at Hogwarts.”
“Oh,” said the boy, “I’ve heard of him. He’s a sort of servant, isn’t he?”
“He’s the gamekeeper,” said Harry. He was liking the boy less and less
every second.
“Yes, exactly. I heard he’s a sort of 
savage
 — lives in a hut on the school
grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic,  eart
leapt. There were no Aurors waiting outside the inn, but instead the gigantic,
black-bearded form of Rubeus Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper, wearing a
long beaverskin coat, beaming at the sight of Harry’s face and oblivious to the
startled stares of passing Muggles.“Harry!” he boomed, sweeping Harry into a bone-crushing hug the moment
Harry had stepped out of the car. “Buckbeak — Witherwings, I mean — yeh
should see him, Harry, he’s so happy ter be back in the open air —”
“Glad he’s pleased,” said Harr"
What position does Harry play on his Quidditch team?,Seeker,"According to the text, Harry plays as a Seeker on his Quidditch team.","or Quidditch team to re-form? How you took the case to
Dumbledore, who insisted that the team be allowed to play? Well, now, I
couldn’t have that. I contacted the Minister at once, and he quite agreed with
me that the High Inquisitor has to have the power to strip pupils of privileges,
or she — that is to say, I — would have less authority than common teachers!
And you see now, don’t you, Minerva, how right I was in attempting to stop
the Gryffindor team re-forming? 
Dreadful
 tempers . . . Anyway, I was re nk-you’re-being-very-sensitive sortof voice, “Harry doesn’t want to play Quidditch right now. . . . He’s worried,
and he’s tired. . . . We all need to go to bed. . . .”
“Yeah, I want to play Quidditch,” said Harry suddenly. “Hang on, I’ll get
my Firebolt.”
Hermione left the room, muttering something that sounded very much like
“Boys.”
Neither Mr. Weasley nor Percy was at home much over the following week.
Both left the house each morning before the rest of the family got up, and
returned well after dinner e he damage, but Harry swore to himself not to
meddle in things that weren’t his business from now on. He’d had it with
sneaking around and spying. He felt so ashamed of himself that he went to
Wood and offered to resign from the Quidditch team.
“Resign?”
 Wood thundered. “What good’ll that do? How are we going toget any points back if we can’t win at Quidditch?”
But even Quidditch had lost its fun. The rest of the team wouldn’t speak to
Harry during practice, and if they had to speak about him, they called h hurried off to clear up his muddy footprints with her wand.
“I don’ believe this,” said Hagrid hoarsely, shaking his great shaggy head as
he stared down at Ron. “Jus’ don’ believe it . . . Look at him lyin’ there. . . .
Who’d want ter hurt him, eh?”
“That’s just what we were discussing,” said Harry. “We don’t know.”
“Someone couldn’ have a grudge against the Gryffindor Quidditch team,
could they?” said Hagrid anxiously. “Firs’ Katie, now Ron . . .”
“I can’t see anyone trying to bump off a Quidditch team,” s arry’s face. “What’s the
matter with you? You look terrible.”
Speaking quietly so that no one else would hear, Harry told the other two
about Snape’s sudden, sinister desire to be a Quidditch referee.
“Don’t play,” said Hermione at once.“Say you’re ill,” said Ron.
“Pretend to break your leg,” Hermione suggested.
“
Really
 break your leg,” said Ron.
“I can’t,” said Harry. “There isn’t a reserve Seeker. If I back out, Gryffindor
can’t play at all.”
At that moment Neville toppled into the common room. How he h r heads.
“I’m sorry,” Ron mumbled, looking at his feet.
“What for?” said Harry.
“For thinking I can play Quidditch,” said Ron. “I’m going to resign first
thing tomorrow.”
“If you resign,” said Harry testily, “there’ll only be three players left on the
team.” And when Ron looked puzzled, he said, “I’ve been given a lifetime
ban. So’ve Fred and George.”“What?” Ron yelped.
Hermione told him the full story; Harry could not bear to tell it again.
When she had finished, Ron looked more anguished than ever.
“This  in
Quidditch team, the same position that Harry played on the Gryffindor team.
Crabbe and Goyle seemed to exist to do Malfoy’s bidding. They were both
wide and musclely; Crabbe was taller, with a pudding-bowl haircut and a very
thick neck; Goyle had short, bristly hair and long, gorilla-ish arms.
“Well, look who it is,” said Malfoy in his usual lazy drawl, pulling open the
compartment door. “Potty and the Weasel.”
Crabbe and Goyle chuckled trollishly.
“I heard your father finally got his hands on some gold   door buying my books and Mother’s up the street
looking at wands,” said the boy. He had a bored, drawling voice. “Then I’m
going to drag them off to look at racing brooms. I don’t see why first years
can’t have their own. I think I’ll bully Father into getting me one and I’ll
smuggle it in somehow.”
Harry was strongly reminded of Dudley.“Have 
you
 got your own broom?” the boy went on.
“No,” said Harry.
“Play Quidditch at all?”
“No,” Harry said again, wondering what on earth Quidditch could be.

Who is the ghost of Gryffindor House?,Nearly Headless Nick,The ghost of Gryffindor House is Nearly Headless Nick.,"ching the
bottom of the stairs, where Nearly Headless Nick, ghost of Gryffindor Tower,
stood waiting for him.
“Harry! My dear boy!”Nick made to grasp Harry’s hands with both of his own: Harry’s felt as
though they had been thrust into icy water.
“Nick, you’ve got to help me. Who’s the ghost of Ravenclaw Tower?”
Nearly Headless Nick looked surprised and a little offended.
“The Gray Lady, of course; but if it is ghostly services you require — ?”
“It’s got to be her — d’you know where she is?”
“Let’s see. . .   you are here, your House will be something like
your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your
House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free time in your House
common room.
“The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and
Slytherin. Each House has its own noble history and each has produced
outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs
will earn your House points, while any rule-breaking will lose House points.
At the end of the ,” Vernon Dursley said now, resuming his pacing up and
down the living room, “we — Petunia, Dudley, and I — are in danger. From
— from —”
“Some of ‘my lot,’ right,” said Harry.
“Well, I don’t believe it,” repeated Uncle Vernon, coming to a halt in front
of Harry again. “I was awake half the night thinking it all over, and I believe
it’s a plot to get the house.”
“The house?” repeated Harry. “What house?”
“
This 
house!” shrieked Uncle Vernon, the vein in his forehead starting to
pulse. “
Our
 house! House p shook his hand
vigorously, while the Weasley twins yelled, “We got Potter! We got Potter!”
Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff he’d seen earlier. The ghost
patted his arm, giving Harry the sudden, horrible feeling he’d just plunged it
into a bucket of ice-cold water.He could see the High Table properly now. At the end nearest him sat
Hagrid, who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up. Harry grinned back.
And there, in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair, sat Albus
Dumbledore. Ha ances he deserves? He
gives us all a bad name and you know, he’s not really even a ghost — I say,
what are you all doing here?”
A ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first years.
Nobody answered.
“New students!” said the Fat Friar, smiling around at them. “About to be
Sorted, I suppose?”
A few people nodded mutely.
“Hope to see you in Hufflepuff!” said the Friar. “My old House, you
know.”
“Move along now,” said a sharp voice. “The Sorting Ceremony’s about to
start.”
Professor McGonagall  in a row! The Bloody Baron’s becoming almost
unbearable — he’s the Slytherin ghost.”
Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting
there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained with silver
blood. He was right next to Malfoy who, Harry was pleased to see, didn’t
look too pleased with the seating arrangements.
“How did he get covered in blood?” asked Seamus with great interest.
“I’ve never asked,” said Nearly Headless Nick delicately.
When everyone had eaten as m and-tip, a great, grayish something, that
looked as though it were made of the solidest, densest smoke. . . . It was a
head . . . now a chest and arms . . . the torso of Cedric Diggory.
If ever Harry might have released his wand from shock, it would have been
then, but instinct kept him clutching his wand tightly, so that the thread of
golden light remained unbroken, even though the thick gray ghost of Cedric
Diggory (
was
 it a ghost? it looked so solid) emerged in its entirety from the
end of Voldemort’s   Gryffindor House fifty points.”
Hermione buried her face in her arms; Harry strongly suspected she hadburst into tears. Gryffindors up and down the table were beside themselves —
they were a hundred points up.
“Third — to Mr. Harry Potter . . .” said Dumbledore. The room went
deadly quiet. “. . . for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor
House sixty points.”
The din was deafening. Those who could add up while yelling themselves
hoarse knew that Gryffindor now had four hundred and seventy-t"
What magical creature pulls the carriages to Hogwarts?,Thestrals,"According to the text, the magical creature that pulls the carriages to Hogwarts is a Thestral.",", I wouldn’t fancy crossing the lake in this weather,” said Hermione
fervently, shivering as they inched slowly along the dark platform with the
rest of the crowd. A hundred horseless carriages stood waiting for them
outside the station. Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Neville climbed gratefully into
one of them, the door shut with a snap, and a few moments later, with a great
lurch, the long procession of carriages was rumbling and splashing its way up
the track toward Hogwarts Castle.T
 
CHAPTER  TWELVE
THE TRI flustered, and
following Krum through the crowd and out of sight.
“You’d better hurry up!” Ron called loudly after her. “The carriages’ll be
here in a minute!”
He let Harry keep a watch for the carriages, however, and spent the next
few minutes craning his neck over the crowd to try and see what Krum and
Hermione might be up to. They returned quite soon. Ron stared at Hermione,
but her face was quite impassive.
“I liked Diggory,” said Krum abruptly to Harry. “He vos alvays polite to
me. Alvays. Even though  . The little
creature on the bed had large, bat-like ears and bulging green eyes the
size of tennis balls. Harry knew instantly that this was what had been
watching him out of the garden hedge that morning.
As they stared at each other, Harry heard Dudley’s voice from the hall.
“May I take your coats, Mr. and Mrs. Mason?”
The creature slipped off the bed and bowed so low that the end of its long,
thin nose touched the carpet. Harry noticed that it was wearing what looked
like an old pillowcase, with rips fo d horse. Ron stared straight at it for a second, then looked
back at Harry.
“What am I supposed to be looking at?”
“At the — there, between the shafts! Harnessed to the coach! It’s right
there in front —”
But as Ron continued to look bemused, a strange thought occurred to
Harry.
“Can’t . . . can’t you see them?”
“See 
what
?”
“Can’t you see what’s pulling the carriages?”
Ron looked seriously alarmed now.
“Are you feeling all right, Harry?”
“I . . . yeah . . .”
Harry felt utterly bewildered. The horse was th id down to their feet. A horrible,
half-sucking, half-moaning sound came out of the square hole, along with an
unpleasant smell like open drains.
“That’s your ghoul, isn’t it?” asked Harry, who had never actually met the
creature that sometimes disrupted the nightly silence.
“Yeah, it is,” said Ron, climbing the ladder. “Come and have a look at
him.”
Harry followed Ron up the few short steps into the tiny attic space. His
head and shoulders were in the room before he caught sight of the creature
curled up a pes shifted all around him.
“The thing that lives in the castle,” said Aragog, “is an ancient creature we
spiders fear above all others. Well do I remember how I pleaded with Hagrid
to let me go, when I sensed the beast moving about the school.”
“What is it?” said Harry urgently.
More loud clicking, more rustling; the spiders seemed to be closing in.
“We do not speak of it!” said Aragog fiercely. “We do not name it! I never
even told Hagrid the name of that dread creature, though he asked me, many
times.”
H and there was no
escape —
And when the creature spoke, it used Harry’s mouth, so that in his agony he
felt his jaw move. . . .
“Kill me now, Dumbledore . . .”
Blinded and dying, every part of him screaming for release, Harry felt the
creature use him again. . . .
“If death is nothing, Dumbledore, kill the boy . . .”Let the pain stop,
 thought Harry. 
Let him kill us. . . . End it,
Dumbledore. . . . Death is nothing compared to this. . . .
And I’ll see Sirius again. . . .
And as Harry’s heart filled with emo No Pain, No Stain! . . . Gladrags Wizardwear — London, Paris,
Hogsmeade . . .
Harry tore his eyes away from the sign and looked over his shoulder to see
who else was sharing the box with them. So far it was empty, except for a tiny
creature sitting in the second from last seat at the end of the row behind them.
The creature, whose legs were so short they stuck out in front of it on the
chair, was wearing a tea towel draped like a toga, and it had its face hidden in
its hands. Yet those long, batlike ears we"
What is the name of the house elf who serves the Malfoy family?,Dobby,"According to the text, the house-elf who serves the Malfoy family is not explicitly mentioned. However, it is mentioned that the house-elf in question is currently in the employ of Hogwarts School, but it is not specified that this house-elf serves the Malfoy family.","ken up with a particularly loud
screech and was beating her wings wildly against the bars of her cage.“Dobby had to punish himself, sir,” said the elf, who had gone slightly
cross-eyed. “Dobby almost spoke ill of his family, sir. . . .”
“Your family?”
“The wizard family Dobby serves, sir. . . . Dobby is a house-elf — bound to
serve one house and one family forever. . . .”
“Do they know you’re here?” asked Harry curiously.
Dobby shuddered.
“Oh, no, sir, no . . . Dobby will have to punish himself most grievou  Malfoy made Dudley Dursley look like a kind,
thoughtful, and sensitive boy.
“I don’t know whether the Malfoys own a house-elf. . . .” said Harry.
“Well, whoever owns him will be an old Wizarding family, and they’ll be
rich,” said Fred.
“Yeah, Mum’s always wishing we had a house-elf to do the ironing,” said
George. “But all we’ve got is a lousy old ghoul in the attic and gnomes all
over the garden. House-elves come with big old manors and castles and
places like that; you wouldn’t catch one in our house. .  . .”Harry was silent. Judging by the fact that Draco Malfoy usually had the
best of everything, his family was rolling in wizard gold; he could just see
Malfoy strutting around a large manor house. Sending the family servant to
stop Harry from going back to Hogwarts also sounded exactly like the sort of
thing Malfoy would do. Had Harry been stupid to take Dobby seriously?
“I’m glad we came to get you, anyway,” said Ron. “I was getting really
worried when you didn’t answer any of my letters. I thought it was Harry.
“YOU SEE?” roared Fudge, gesturing flamboyantly in Harry’s direction.
“A house-elf! In a Muggle house! I ask you —”
“The house-elf in question is currently in the employ of Hogwarts School,”
said Dumbledore. “I can summon him here in an instant to give evidence if
you wish.”
“I — not — I haven’t got time to listen to house-elves! Anyway, that’s not
the only — he blew up his aunt, for God’s sake!” Fudge shouted, banging his
fist on the judge’s bench and upsetting a bottle of ink.
“And you very kindly  s tent, Harry Potter, but Winky does
what she is told. Winky is a good house-elf.”
She gave the edge of the box another frightened look and hid her eyes
completely again. Harry turned back to the others.
“So that’s a house-elf?” Ron muttered. “Weird things, aren’t they?”
“Dobby was weirder,” said Harry fervently.
Ron pulled out his Omnioculars and started testing them, staring down into
the crowd on the other side of the stadium.
“Wild!” he said, twiddling the replay knob on the side. “I can make that old
b e, turning around. “Not Lucius Malfoy’s son?”
“Must be, it’s not a very common name, is it?” said Harry. “Why?”
“I’ve heard Dad talking about him,” said George. “He was a big supporter
of You-Know-Who.”
“And when You-Know-Who disappeared,” said Fred, craning around to
look at Harry, “Lucius Malfoy came back saying he’d never meant any of it.
Load of dung — Dad reckons he was right in You-Know-Who’s inner circle.”
Harry had heard these rumors about Malfoy’s family before, and they
didn’t surprise him at all. s had closed behind her he rounded on Ron.
“What d’you think?”
“Wish I could Disapparate like a house-elf,” said Ron, staring at the spot
where Dobby had vanished. “I’d have that Apparition Test in the bag.”
Harry did not sleep well that night. He lay awake for what felt like hours,
wondering how Malfoy was using the Room of Requirement and what he,
Harry, would see when he went in there the following day, for whatever
Hermione said, Harry was sure that if Malfoy had been able to see the
headquarters of the Malfoy’s cold drawl from
behind them. “Are you trying to earn some extra money, Weasley? Hoping to
be gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts, I suppose — that hut of
Hagrid’s must seem like a palace compared to what your family’s used to.”
Ron dived at Malfoy just as Snape came up the stairs.
“WEASLEY!”
Ron let go of the front of Malfoy’s robes.
“He was provoked, Professor Snape,” said Hagrid, sticking his huge hairy
face out from behind the tree. “Malfoy was insultin’ his family.”
“Be that as it may, "
Who is the Half-Blood Prince?,Severus Snape,"The Half-Blood Prince is the mysterious owner of an old potions textbook that Harry finds in the Hogwarts library. The book contains notes and annotations that help Harry with his potions homework, but also reveal the Half-Blood Prince's identity and motivations, which remain a mystery throughout the story.","n of his father had reminded him that there was something he
had been looking forward to asking Lupin.
“Have you ever heard of someone called the Half-Blood Prince?”
“The Half-Blood what?”
“Prince,” said Harry, watching him closely for signs of recognition.
“There are no Wizarding princes,” said Lupin, now smiling. “Is this a title
you’re thinking of adopting? I should have thought being ‘the Chosen One’
would be enough.”
“It’s nothing to do with me!” said Harry indignantly. “The Half-Blood
Prince is someon  If, say, her father wasa wizard whose surname was Prince, and her mother was a Muggle, then that
would make her a ‘half-blood Prince’!”
“Yeah, very ingenious, Hermione . . .”
“But it would! Maybe she was proud of being half a Prince!”
“Listen, Hermione, I can tell it’s not a girl. I can just tell.”
“The truth is that you don’t think a girl would have been clever enough,”
said Hermione angrily.
“How can I have hung round with you for five years and not think girls are
clever?” said Harry, stung by this. “It . “Can I borrow your quill for the
conclusion?”
Harry, who had found nothing useful in the Half-Blood Prince’s notes so
far, looked around; the three of them were now the only ones left in the
common room, Seamus having just gone up to bed cursing Snape and his
essay. The only sounds were the crackling of the fire and Ron scratching out
one last paragraph on dementors using Hermione’s quill. Harry had just
closed the Half-Blood Prince’s book, yawning, when —
Crack.
Hermione let out a little shriek; Ron spil rmione, meanwhile, was resolutely plowing on
with what she called the “official” instructions, but becoming increasingly
bad-tempered as they yielded poorer results than the Prince’s.
Harry wondered vaguely who the Half-Blood Prince had been. Although
the amount of homework they had been given prevented him from reading the
whole of his copy of 
Advanced Potion-Making,
 he had skimmed through it
sufficiently to see that there was barely a page on which the Prince had not
made additional notes, not all of th all him ‘Prince.’”
Abandoning pretense, Harry said, “And it wasn’t Sirius? Or you?”
“Definitely not.”
“Oh.” Harry stared into the fire. “I just thought — well, he’s helped me out
a lot in Potions classes, the Prince has.”
“How old is this book, Harry?”
“I dunno, I’ve never checked.”
“Well, perhaps that will give you some clue as to when the Prince was at
Hogwarts,” said Lupin.
Shortly after this, Fleur decided to imitate Celestina singing “A Cauldron
Full of Hot, Strong Love,” which was taken by everyone, o em concerned with potion-making. Here
and there were directions for what looked like spells that the Prince had made
up himself.
“Or herself,” said Hermione irritably, overhearing Harry pointing some of
these out to Ron in the common room on Saturday evening. “It might have
been a girl. I think the handwriting looks more like a girl’s than a boy’s.”“The Half-Blood 
Prince,
 he was called,” Harry said. “How many girls have
been Princes?”
Hermione seemed to have no answer to this. She merely scowled and
twitc h the picture
belonged; it was a rather dull story about interschool competitions.
“Her name was Eileen Prince. 
Prince,
 Harry.”
They looked at each other, and Harry realized what Hermione was trying to
say. He burst out laughing.
“No way.”
“What?”
“You think 
she
 was the Half-Blood . . . ? Oh, come on.”
“Well, why not? Harry, there aren’t any real princes in the Wizarding
world! It’s either a nickname, a made-up title somebody’s given themselves,
or it could be their actual name, couldn’t it? No, listen! from the Half-Blood Prince than Snape or Slughorn have taught
me in —”
“I’m not talking about your stupid so-called Prince,” said Hermione, giving
his book a nasty look as though it had been rude to her. “I’m talking about
earlier. I went into the girls’ bathroom just before I came in here and there
were about a dozen girls in there, including that Romilda Vane, trying to
decide how to slip you a love potion. They’re all hoping they’re going to get
you to take them to Slughorn’s party, and they all seem to "
What is the spell to summon objects?,Accio,"According to the context, the spell to summon objects is not explicitly mentioned. However, it is implied that the Dark Mark is being used to summon the Dark Lord Voldemort, as Lucius Malfoy attempts to prevent Bellatrix Lestrange from touching it."," she backed away, the better to take in
Harry. “Are you sure? Well then, the Dark Lord must be informed at once!”
She dragged back her left sleeve: Harry saw the Dark Mark burned into the
flesh of her arm, and knew that she was about to touch it, to summon her
beloved master —
“I was about to call him!” said Lucius, and his hand actually closed upon
Bellatrix’s wrist, preventing her from touching the Mark. “
I 
shall summon
him, Bella, Potter has been brought to my house, and it is therefore upon my
authori Hufflepuff’s cup!”
“Yes,” said Dumbledore, smiling, “I would be prepared to bet — perhaps
not my other hand — but a couple of fingers, that they became Horcruxes
three and four. The remaining two, assuming again that he created a total of
six, are more of a problem, but I will hazard a guess that, having secured
objects from Hufflepuff and Slytherin, he set out to track down objects owned
by Gryffindor or Ravenclaw. Four objects from the four founders would, I am
sure, have exerted a powerful pull over Vold usband in her
cold, clear voice. “Completely sure that it is Potter, before we summon the
Dark Lord . . . They say this is his” — she was looking closely at the
blackthorn wand — “but it does not resemble Ollivander’s description. . . . If
we are mistaken, if we call the Dark Lord here for nothing . . . Remember
what he did to Rowle and Dolohov?”
“What about the Mudblood, then?” growled Greyback. Harry was nearly
thrown off his feet as the Snatchers forced the prisoners to swivel around
again, so that the l ed, 
“Stupefy!”
The great blond Death Eater was hit in the face by a jet of red light: He
slumped sideways, unconscious. His companion, unable to see who had cast
the spell, fired another at Ron: Shining black ropes flew from his wand-tip
and bound Ron head to foot — the waitress screamed and ran for the door —
Harry sent another Stunning Spell at the Death Eater with the twisted face
who had tied up Ron, but the spell missed, rebounded on the window, and hit
the waitress, who collapsed in front of the door ceived Yaxley instead. Would the elf keep silent or would he tell the Death
Eater everything he knew? Harry wanted to believe that Kreacher had
changed toward him in the past month, that he would be loyal now, but who
knew what would happen? What if the Death Eaters tortured the elf? Sick
images swarmed into Harry’s head and he tried to push these away too, for
there was nothing he could do for Kreacher: He and Hermione had already
decided against trying to summon him; what if someone from the Ministry
came is own precious soul? You are forgetting what I have showed you.
Lord Voldemort liked to collect trophies, and he preferred objects with a
powerful magical history. His pride, his belief in his own superiority, his
determination to carve for himself a startling place in magical history; these
things suggest to me that Voldemort would have chosen his Horcruxes with
some care, favoring objects worthy of the honor.”
“The diary wasn’t that special.”
“The diary, as you have said yourself, was proof that he was t e folds of the faded
curtains, looked disappointed.
“Is that it, then? It’s not here?”
“Oh, it could still be here, but under counter-enchantments,” said
Hermione. “Charms to prevent it being summoned magically, you know.”
“Like Voldemort put on the stone basin in the cave,” said Harry,
remembering how he had been unable to Summon the fake locket.
“How are we supposed to find it then?” asked Ron.
“We search manually,” said Hermione.
“That’s a good idea,” said Ron, rolling his eyes, and he resumed his
examin rry seated so insecurely. Harry sent Stunning Spell
after Stunning Spell back at their pursuers, barely holding them off. He shot
another blocking jinx at them: The closest Death Eater swerved to avoid it
and his hood slipped, and by the red light of his next Stunning Spell, Harry
saw the strangely blank face of Stanley Shunpike — Stan —
“Expelliarmus!”
 Harry yelled.
“That’s him, it’s him, it’s the real one!”
The hooded Death Eater’s shout reached Harry even above the thunder of
the motorbike’s engine: Nex"

Dumbledore. “The aftermath of our little meeting proved that. You see, we

CHAPTER  TWENTY-ONE
THE UNKNOWABLE ROOM
arry wracked his brains over the next week as to how he was to
persuade Slughorn to hand over the true memory, b was still fighting his way across the
lake with the first years; Professor McGonagall was presumably supervisingthe drying of the entrance hall floor, but there was another empty chair too,
and Harry couldn’t think who else was missing.
“Where’s the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher?” said Hermione,
who was also looking up at the teachers.
They had never yet had a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher who had
lasted more than three terms. Harry’s favorite by far had been Professor
Lupin, who had res ogether, turning to stare at Harry. “But
you said —”
“Professor Snape, meanwhile,” said Dumbledore, raising his voice so that it
carried over all the muttering, “will be taking over the position of Defense
Against the Dark Arts teacher.”
“No!” said Harry, so loudly that many heads turned in his direction. He didnot care; he was staring up at the staff table, incensed. How could Snape be
given the Defense Against the Dark Arts job after all this time? Hadn’t it been
widely known for years that Dumbledore did their Defense
Against the Dark Arts O.W.L. this time around, they will need to work a little
harder than they are doing at pres —”“What does it matter?” said Malfoy. “Defense Against the Dark Arts — it’s
all just a joke, isn’t it, an act? Like any of us need protecting against the Dark
Arts —”
“It is an act that is crucial to success, Draco!” said Snape. “Where do you
think I would have been all these years, if I had not known how to act? Now
listen to me! You are being incautious, wandering around at night he teaches?” said Ron, frowning at Professor Lupin’s pallid
profile.
“That’s obvious,” whispered Hermione. “There’s only one vacancy, isn’t
there? Defense Against the Dark Arts.”
Harry, Ron, and Hermione had already had two Defense Against the Dark
Arts teachers, both of whom had lasted only one year. There were rumors that
the job was jinxed.
“Well, I hope he’s up to it,” said Ron doubtfully. “He looks like one good
hex would finish him off, doesn’t he? Anyway . . .” He turned to Harry.
“What were you goin Dark Arts teacher.”
There was some scattered, rather unenthusiastic applause. Only those who
had been in the compartment on the train with Professor Lupin clapped hard,
Harry among them. Professor Lupin looked particularly shabby next to all the
other teachers in their best robes.
“Look at Snape!” Ron hissed in Harry’s ear.
Professor Snape, the Potions master, was staring along the staff table at
Professor Lupin. It was common knowledge that Snape wanted the Defense
Against the Dark Arts job, but even Harry n; it hissed menacingly
and turned from turquoise to orange.
“You applied first for the Defense Against the Dark Arts post, I believe?”
Professor Umbridge asked Snape.
“Yes,” said Snape quietly.
“But you were unsuccessful?”
Snape’s lip curled.
“Obviously.”
Professor Umbridge scribbled on her clipboard.
“And you have applied regularly for the Defense Against the Dark Arts
post since you first joined the school, I believe?”
“Yes,” said Snape quietly, barely moving his lips. He looked very angry.
“Do you have  our Charm work seems satisfactory; as for Defense Against the Dark
Arts, your marks have been generally high, Professor Lupin in particular
thought you — 
are you quite sure you wouldn’t like a cough drop, Dolores?
”
“Oh, no need, thank you, Minerva,” simpered Professor Umbridge, who
had just coughed her loudest yet. “I was just concerned that you might not
have Harry’s most recent Defense Against the Dark Arts marks in front of
you. I’m quite sure I slipped in a note . . .”
“What, this thing?” said Profess"
What is the name of the three-headed dog that guards the Philosopher's Stone?,Fluffy,The three-headed dog that guards the Philosopher's Stone is called Fluffy.," knew you’d seen me coming to look at what was guarding
the Stone.”
“
You
 let the troll in?”
“Certainly. I have a special gift with trolls — you must have seen what I
did to the one in the chamber back there? Unfortunately, while everyone else
was running around looking for it, Snape, who already suspected me, went
straight to the third floor to head me off — and not only did my troll fail to
beat you to death, that three-headed dog didn’t even manage to bite Snape’s
leg off properly.
“Now, wait quietly, P ht into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a dog thatfilled the whole space between ceiling and floor. It had three heads. Three
pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching and quivering in their
direction; three drooling mouths, saliva hanging in slippery ropes from
yellowish fangs.
It was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and Harry knew that
the only reason they weren’t already dead was that their sudden appearance
had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over that, there wa are you okay?”
“Where’s the dog?”
“Not a dog,” Ron moaned. His teeth were gritted with pain. “Harry, it’s a
trap —”
“What —”
“He’s the dog . . . he’s an Animagus. . . .”
Ron was staring over Harry’s shoulder. Harry wheeled around. With a snap,
the man in the shadows closed the door behind them.
A mass of filthy, matted hair hung to his elbows. If eyes hadn’t been
shining out of the deep, dark sockets, he might have been a corpse. The waxy
skin was stretched so tightly over the bones of his face, it looked l ts paws and fell to its knees,
then it slumped to the ground, fast asleep.
“Keep playing,” Ron warned Harry as they slipped out of the Cloak and
crept toward the trapdoor. They could feel the dog’s hot, smelly breath as they
approached the giant heads.
“I think we’ll be able to pull the door open,” said Ron, peering over the
dog’s back. “Want to go first, Hermione?”
“No, I don’t!”“All right.” Ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dog’s legs.
He bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor, which  g your broomstick, muttering, he wouldn’t take his eyes off you.”
“Rubbish,” said Hagrid, who hadn’t heard a word of what had gone on next
to him in the stands. “Why would Snape do somethin’ like that?”
Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another, wondering what to tell
him. Harry decided on the truth.
“I found out something about him,” he told Hagrid. “He tried to get past
that three-headed dog on Halloween. It bit him. We think he was trying to
steal whatever it’s guarding.”
Hagrid dropped the teapot.
 s!”
The grave was extremely old, weathered so that Harry could hardly make
out the name. Hermione showed him the symbol beneath it.
“Harry, that’s the mark in the book!”
He peered at the place she indicated: The stone was so worn that it was
hard to make out what was engraved there, though there did seem to be a
triangular mark beneath the nearly illegible name.
“Yeah . . . it could be. . . .”
Hermione lit her wand and pointed it at the name on the headstone.
“It says Ig
 — 
Ignotus, I think. . . .”
“I’m go ed with fury as he dropped his robes quickly to hide
his leg. Harry gulped.
“I just wondered if I could have my book back.”
“GET OUT! 
OUT!
”
Harry left, before Snape could take any more points from Gryffindor. He
sprinted back upstairs.
“Did you get it?” Ron asked as Harry joined them. “What’s the matter?”
In a low whisper, Harry told them what he’d seen.
“You know what this means?” he finished breathlessly. “He tried to get past
that three-headed dog at Halloween! That’s where he was going when we saw
him mort, isn’t it? These dreadful things that are happening are all down to
him. . . .”
The bell rang overhead in the castle and both Hermione and Ron jumped to
their feet, looking terrified.
“You’ll do fine,” Harry told them both, as they headed toward the entrance
hall to meet the rest of the people taking their Apparition Test. “Good luck.”
“And you too!” said Hermione with a significant look, as Harry headed off
to the dungeons.
There were only three of them in Potions that afternoon: Harry, Ernie, and
Dra"
What creature is Aragog?,Acromantula,Aragog is a giant spider.,"pes shifted all around him.
“The thing that lives in the castle,” said Aragog, “is an ancient creature we
spiders fear above all others. Well do I remember how I pleaded with Hagrid
to let me go, when I sensed the beast moving about the school.”
“What is it?” said Harry urgently.
More loud clicking, more rustling; the spiders seemed to be closing in.
“We do not speak of it!” said Aragog fiercely. “We do not name it! I never
even told Hagrid the name of that dread creature, though he asked me, many
times.”
H gh’ nice of him, that is, an’ not turnin’ yeh in either. I’ve never really
had a lot ter do with Horace Slughorn before. . . . Comin’ ter see old Aragog
off, though, eh? Well . . . he’d’ve liked that, Aragog would. . . .”
Harry thought privately that what Aragog would have liked most about
Slughorn was the ample amount of edible flesh he provided, but he merely
moved to the rear window of Hagrid’s hut, where he saw the rather horrible
sight of the enormous dead spider lying on its back outside, its legs cur arry didn’t want to press the subject, not with the spiders pressing closer
on all sides. Aragog seemed to be tired of talking. He was backing slowly into
his domed web, but his fellow spiders continued to inch slowly toward Harry
and Ron.
“We’ll just go, then,” Harry called desperately to Aragog, hearing leaves
rustling behind him.
“Go?” said Aragog slowly. “I think not. . . .”
“But — but —”
“My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid, on my command. But I
cannot deny them fresh meat, when it wanders so will  with his brutal giant of a half-brother,
but this was perhaps the most incomprehensible of all his monster fancies: the
gigantic talking spider, Aragog, who dwelled deep in the Forbidden Forest
and which he and Ron had only narrowly escaped four years previously.
“Is there — is there anything we can do?” Hermione asked, ignoring Ron’s
frantic grimaces and head-shakings.
“I don’ think there is, Hermione,” choked Hagrid, attempting to stem the
flood of his tears. “See, the rest o’ the tribe . . . Aragog’s fa  onto his bed without bothering to get undressed. Harry, however,
didn’t feel very sleepy. He sat on the edge of his four-poster, thinking hard
about everything Aragog had said.
The creature that was lurking somewhere in the castle, he thought, sounded
like a sort of monster Voldemort — even other monsters didn’t want to name
it. But he and Ron were no closer to finding out what it was, or how it
Petrified its victims. Even Hagrid had never known what was in the Chamber
of Secrets.Harry swung his legs up on t me coming down here, Hagrid.”
“Not in trouble, are yeh?” said Hagrid, looking up, alarmed. “Yeh shouldn’
be outta the castle in the evenin’, I know it, it’s my fault —”
“No, no, when he heard what I was doing he said he’d like to come and pay
his last respects to Aragog too,” said Harry. “He’s gone to change into
something more suitable, I think . . . and he said he’d bring some bottles so
we can drink to Aragog’s memory. . . .”
“Did he?” said Hagrid, looking both astonished and touched. “Tha’s —
tha’s ri  Aragog was the only thing that stopped them from eating
Hagrid.
“Never bin an area o’ the forest I couldn’ go before!” said Hagrid, shaking
his head. “It wasn’ easy, gettin’ Aragog’s body out o’ there, I can tell yeh —
they usually eat their dead, see. . . . But I wanted ter give ’im a nice burial . . .
a proper send-off . . .”
He broke into sobs again and Harry resumed the patting of his elbow,
saying as he did so (for the potion seemed to indicate that it was the rightthing to do), “Professor Slughorn me Aragog.”
“Aragog,” said Harry and Hagrid together.
Both Slughorn and Hagrid drank deeply. Harry, however, with the way
ahead illuminated for him by Felix Felicis, knew that he must not drink, so he
merely pretended to take a gulp and then set the mug back on the table before
him.
“I had him from an egg, yeh know,” said Hagrid morosely. “Tiny little
thing he was when he hatched. ’Bout the size of a Pekingese.”
“Sweet,” said Slughorn.
“Used ter keep him in a cupboard up at the school until . . . well . . .”
H"
Who does Harry marry?,Ginny Weasley,"According to the context, Harry marries Ginny Weasley.","at he really is going to marry
her,” sighed Ginny later that evening, as she, Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat
beside the open window of the Gryffindor common room, looking out over
the twilit grounds.
“She’s not that bad,” said Harry. “Ugly, though,” he added hastily, as Ginny
raised her eyebrows, and she let out a reluctant giggle.
“Well, I suppose if Mum can stand it, I can.”
“Anyone else we know died?” Ron asked Hermione, who was perusing the
Evening Prophet.
Hermione winced at the forced toughness in his v  her eldest son; she began to sob, tears falling onto Bill’s mutilated
face.
“Of course, it doesn’t matter how he looks. . . . It’s not r-really
important . . . but he was a very handsome little b-boy . . . always very
handsome . . . and he was g-going to be married!”
“And what do you mean by zat?” said Fleur suddenly and loudly. “What do
you mean, ‘’e was 
going
 to be married?’”
Mrs. Weasley raised her tear-stained face, looking startled. “Well — only
that —”
“You theenk Bill will not wish to marry me any  have you? Probably
wise. Be sure and marry a pureblood next time.”
Hermione had let out a little squeak of horror. Yaxley looked at her. She
coughed feebly and turned away.
“I — I —” stammered Ron.“But if 
my
 wife were accused of being a Mudblood,” said Yaxley, “— not
that any woman I married would ever be mistaken for such filth — and the
Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement needed a job doing, I
would make it my priority to do that job, Cattermole. Do you understand
me?”
“Yes,” whispered Ro  her, I’ve made her an outcast!”
Lupin kicked aside the chair he had overturned.
“You have only ever seen me amongst the Order, or under Dumbledore’s
protection at Hogwarts! You don’t know how most of the Wizarding world
sees creatures like me! When they know of my affliction, they can barely talk
to me! Don’t you see what I’ve done? Even her own family is disgusted by
our marriage, what parents want their only daughter to marry a werewolf?
And the child — the child —”
Lupin actually seized handfuls of his  u see!” said a strained voice. Tonks was glaring at Lupin. “She still
wants to marry him, even though he’s been bitten! She doesn’t care!”
“It’s different,” said Lupin, barely moving his lips and looking suddenly
tense. “Bill will not be a full werewolf. The cases are completely —”
“But I don’t care either, I don’t care!” said Tonks, seizing the front of
Lupin’s robes and shaking them. “I’ve told you a million times. . . .”And the meaning of Tonks’s Patronus and her mouse-colored hair, and the
reason she ha  asked him.
“Nah, that story’s just one of those things you tell kids to teach them
lessons, isn’t it? ‘Don’t go looking for trouble, don’t pick fights, don’t go
messing around with stuff that’s best left alone! Just keep your head down,

added, “maybe that story’s why elder wands are supposed to be unlucky.”“What are you talking about?”
“One of those superstitions, isn’t it? ‘May-born witches will marry
Muggles.’ ‘Jinx by twilight, undon  second brother journeyed to his own home, where he

at once before him.

“You theenk, because of these bites, he will not love me?”“No, that’s not what I —”
“Because ’e will!” said Fleur, drawing herself up to her full height and
throwing back her long mane of silver hair. “It would take more zan a

“Well, yes, I’m sure,” said Mrs. Weasley, “but I thought perhaps — given

What are the names of Harry's children?,"James, Albus, and Lily",I do not know the names of Harry's children.,", drawing hoods over their faces and fleeing as
fast as they could. Hermione looked after them curiously, until the man with
the bloodied bandage came staggering right across her path.
“My children!” he bellowed, pointing at her. His voice was cracked, high-
pitched; he sounded distraught. “Where are my children? What has he done
with them? You know, 
you know
!”
“I — I really —” stammered Hermione.
The man lunged at her, reaching for her throat: Then, with a bang and a
burst of red light he was thrown back owever, it was in his usual curt voice.
“We must follow the rules, and the rules state clearly that those people
whose names come out of the Goblet of Fire are bound to compete in the
tournament.”
“Well, Barty knows the rule book back to front,” said Bagman, beaming
and turning back to Karkaroff and Madame Maxime, as though the matter
was now closed.
“I insist upon resubmitting the names of the rest of my students,” saidKarkaroff. He had dropped his unctuous tone and his smile now. His face
wore a very ugly  matter, however. I have all their names here, MissParkinson ran into the Room of Requirement for me to see if they had left
anything behind. . . . We needed evidence and the room provided . . .”
And to Harry’s horror, she withdrew from her pocket the list of names that
had been pinned upon the Room of Requirement’s wall and handed it to
Fudge.
“The moment I saw Potter’s name on the list, I knew what we were dealing
with,” she said softly.
“Excellent,” said Fudge, a smile spreading across his face. “Excelle  “I saw the Death Eaters! I cangive you their names! Lucius Malfoy —”
Snape made a sudden movement, but as Harry looked at him, Snape’s eyes
flew back to Fudge.
“Malfoy was cleared!” said Fudge, visibly affronted. “A very old family —
donations to excellent causes —”
“Macnair!” Harry continued.
“Also cleared! Now working for the Ministry!”
“Avery — Nott — Crabbe — Goyle —”
“You are merely repeating the names of those who were acquitted of being
Death Eaters thirteen years ago!” said Fudge angrily. “You coul -

counted myself among them —”
“Get on with it,” sneered Moody.
“— we never knew the names of every one of our fellows — He alone
knew exactly who we all were —”
“Which was a wise move, wasn’t it, as it prevented someone like you,
Karkaroff, from turning all of them in,” muttered Moody.
“Yet you say you have 
some
 names for us?” said Mr. Crouch.
“I — I do a married a Muggle-born, Ted Tonks, so

Sirius mimed blasting the tapestry with a wand and laughed sourly. Harry,
however, did not laugh; he was too busy staring at the names to the right of
Andromeda’s burn mark. A double line of gold embroidery linked NarcissaBlack with Lucius Malfoy, and a single vertical gold line from their names led
to the name Draco.
“You’re related to the Malfoys!”
“The pure-blood families are all interrelated,” said Sirius. “If you’re only
going to let your sons and daughters mar the two fights,
Voldemort and his three opponents, Bellatrix and Molly, and Harry stood,
invisible, torn between both, wanting to attack and yet to protect, unable to be
sure that he would not hit the innocent.
“What will happen to your children when I’ve killed you?” taunted
Bellatrix, as mad as her master, capering as Molly’s curses danced around her.
“When Mummy’s gone the same way as Freddie?”
“You — will — never — touch — our — children — again!” screamed
Mrs. Weasley.
Bellatrix laughed, the same exhil -white flames.
Dumbledore closed the casket and placed the goblet carefully on top of it,
where it would be clearly visible to everyone in the Hall.
“Anybody wishing to submit themselves as champion must write their
name and school clearly upon a slip of parchment and drop it into the goblet,”
said Dumbledore. “Aspiring champions have twenty-four hours in which to

What is the name of the wand shop in Diagon Alley?,Ollivanders,The name of the wand shop in Diagon Alley is Ollivander's.,", if it’s really true they’ve got
premises in Diagon Alley now, they must have been planning this for
ages . . .”
“Yeah, but that’s another thing, how did they get premises?” said Ron,
hitting his teacup so hard with his wand that its legs collapsed again and it lay
twitching before him. “It’s a bit dodgy, isn’t it? They’ll need loads of
Galleons to afford the rent on a place in Diagon Alley, she’ll want to know
what they’ve been up to, to get their hands on that sort of gold . . .”
“Well, yes, that occurre eon.
“In Diagon Alley,” said Dumbledore. “I have your list of books and schoolequipment with me. I can help you find everything —”
“You’re coming with me?” asked Riddle, looking up.
“Certainly, if you —”
“I don’t need you,” said Riddle. “I’m used to doing things for myself, I go
round London on my own all the time. How do you get to this Diagon Alley
— sir?” he added, catching Dumbledore’s eye.
Harry thought that Dumbledore would insist upon accompanying Riddle,
but once again he was surprised. Dumbledore h , or Hermione
Granger this time.
Three boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle one at once: It was
the pale boy from Madam Malkin’s robe shop. He was looking at Harry with
a lot more interest than he’d shown back in Diagon Alley.
“Is it true?” he said. “They’re saying all down the train that Harry Potter’s
in this compartment. So it’s you, is it?”
“Yes,” said Harry. He was looking at the other boys. Both of them were
thickset and looked extremely mean. Standing on either side of the pale boy,
they loo t Harry
could see through the dusty shop window was definitely not Diagon Alley.
The sooner he got out of here, the better. Nose still stinging where it had hit
the hearth, Harry made his way swiftly and silently toward the door, but
before he’d got halfway toward it, two people appeared on the other side of
the glass — and one of them was the very last person Harry wanted to meet
when he was lost, covered in soot, and wearing broken glasses: Draco Malfoy.
Harry looked quickly around and spotted a large bla oks as they moved away.
“When we were in Diagon Alley,” Harry began, but Mr. Weasley
forestalled him with a grimace.
“Am I about to discover where you, Ron, and Hermione disappeared to
while you were supposed to be in the back room of Fred and George’s shop?”
“How did you — ?”
“Harry, please. You’re talking to the man who raised Fred and George.”
“Er . . . yeah, all right, we weren’t in the back room.”
“Very well, then, let’s hear the worst.”
“Well, we followed Draco Malfoy. We used my Invisibility Cloak.”
 .”
Harry shivered. He wasn’t sure he liked Mr. Ollivander too much. He paid
seven gold Galleons for his wand, and Mr. Ollivander bowed them from his
shop.The late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harry and Hagrid made their
way back down Diagon Alley, back through the wall, back through the Leaky
Cauldron, now empty. Harry didn’t speak at all as they walked down the road;
he didn’t even notice how much people were gawking at them on the
Underground, laden as they were with all their funny-shaped package d’s dress robes instead of witch’s, and when she
finally bowed them out of the shop it was with an air of being glad to see the
back of them.
“Got ev’rything?” asked Hagrid brightly when they reappeared at his side.
“Just about,” said Harry. “Did you see the Malfoys?”
“Yeah,” said Hagrid, unconcerned. “Bu’ they wouldn’ dare make trouble in
the middle o’ Diagon Alley, Harry. Don’ worry abou’ them.”
Harry, Ron, and Hermione exchanged looks, but before they could disabuse
Hagrid of this comfortable notion, Mr. . He was a good man,
Florean.”
“Talking of Diagon Alley,” said Mr. Weasley, “looks like Ollivander’s gone
too.”
“The wandmaker?” said Ginny, looking startled.
“That’s the one. Shop’s empty. No sign of a struggle. No one knows
whether he left voluntarily or was kidnapped.”
“But wands — what’ll people do for wands?”
“They’ll make do with other makers,” said Lupin. “But Ollivander was the
best, and if the other side have got him it’s not so good for us.”

Who is the head of Slytherin House?,Severus Snape,"The head of Slytherin House is Salazar Slytherin himself, a former student and one of the four founders of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry."," you are here, your House will be something like
your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your
House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free time in your House

“The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and
Slytherin. Each House has its own noble history and each has produced
outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs
will earn your House points, while any rule-breaking will lose House points.
At the end of the had tried to put me in Slytherin, I’d’ve got the
train straight back home. . . .”
Hermione nodded fervently, but Harry didn’t say anything. His stomach
had just dropped unpleasantly.
Harry had never told Ron and Hermione that the Sorting Hat had seriously
considered putting 
him
 in Slytherin. He could remember, as though it were
yesterday, the small voice that had spoken in his ear when he’d placed the hat
on his head a year before: 
You could be great, you know, it’s all here in your
head, and Slytherin w use
Lord Voldemort — 
who 
is
 the last remaining descendant of Salazar Slytherin
— 
can speak Parseltongue. Unless I’m much mistaken, he transferred some of
his own powers to you the night he gave you that scar. Not something he
intended to do, I’m sure. . . .”
“Voldemort put a bit of himself in 
me
?” Harry said, thunderstruck.
“It certainly seems so.”
“So I 
should 
be in Slytherin,” Harry said, looking desperately into
Dumbledore’s face. “The Sorting Hat could see Slytherin’s power in me, and
it —”
“Put ,” Vernon Dursley said now, resuming his pacing up and
down the living room, “we — Petunia, Dudley, and I — are in danger. From
— from —”
“Some of ‘my lot,’ right,” said Harry.
“Well, I don’t believe it,” repeated Uncle Vernon, coming to a halt in front
of Harry again. “I was awake half the night thinking it all over, and I believe
it’s a plot to get the house.”
“The house?” repeated Harry. “What house?”
“
This 
house!” shrieked Uncle Vernon, the vein in his forehead starting to
pulse. “
Our
 house! House p r a while, there
was a serious argument on the subject between Slytherin and Gryffindor, and
Slytherin left the school.”
Professor Binns paused again, pursing his lips, looking like a wrinkled old
tortoise.
“Reliable historical sources tell us this much,” he said. “But these honest
facts have been obscured by the fanciful legend of the Chamber of Secrets.
The story goes that Slytherin had built a hidden chamber in the castle, of
which the other founders knew nothing.
“Slytherin, according to the legend, sea go,and waiting, petrified, for its decision as it muttered aloud in his ear. For a
few horrible seconds he had feared that the hat was going to put him in
Slytherin, the House that had turned out more Dark witches and wizards than
any other — but he had ended up in Gryffindor, along with Ron, Hermione,
and the rest of the Weasleys. Last term, Harry and Ron had helped Gryffindor
win the House Championship, beating Slytherin for the first time in seven
years.
A very small, mousy-haired boy had been called for cer in the Muggle world —
everyone follows Quidditch — played up in the air on broomsticks and
there’s four balls — sorta hard ter explain the rules.”
“And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?”
“School Houses. There’s four. Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o’
duffers, but —”
“I bet I’m in Hufflepuff,” said Harry gloomily.
“Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin,” said Hagrid darkly. “There’s not a
single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn’t in Slytherin. You-Know-
Who was one.”
“Vol-, sorry — You-Know-Who was  tering around the enchanted ceiling,
while hundreds of carved pumpkins leered from every corner. Harry led the
way over to Dean and Seamus, who were discussing those Hogwarts students
of seventeen or over who might be entering.
“There’s a rumor going around that Warrington got up early and put his
name in,” Dean told Harry. “That big bloke from Slytherin who looks like a
sloth.”
Harry, who had played Quidditch against Warrington, shook his head indisgust.
“We can’t have a Slytherin champion!”

What potion grants good luck?,Felix Felicis,"The potion that grants good luck is not explicitly mentioned in this context. However, it seems that Dumbledore is referring to a potion that Hermione has prepared, which requires three turns to complete. The potion is not specified, but it's implied that it's meant to bring good luck to Harry.","d just taken out of her bag.
“Luck can only get you so far, Harry. The situation with Slughorn was
different; you always had the ability to persuade him, you just needed to
tweak the circumstances a bit. Luck isn’t enough to get you through a
powerful enchantment, though. Don’t go wasting the rest of that potion!
You’ll need all the luck you can get if Dumbledore takes you along with him
. . .” She dropped her voice to a whisper.
“Couldn’t we make some more?” Ron asked Harry, ignoring Hermione.
“It’d be gre mber this, both
of you: 
You must not be seen.
 Miss Granger, you know the law — you know
what is at stake. . . . 
You — must — not — be — seen.
”
Harry didn’t have a clue what was going on. Dumbledore had turned on his
heel and looked back as he reached the door.
“I am going to lock you in. It is —” he consulted his watch, “five minutes
to midnight. Miss Granger, three turns should do it. Good luck.”
“Good luck?” Harry repeated as the door closed behind Dumbledore.
“Three turns? What’s he talking about? Wh ed as they
burst into the corridor. “Dobby will be missed — good luck, Harry Potter, sir,
good luck!”
“See you later, Dobby!” Harry shouted, and he sprinted along the corridor
and down the stairs, three at a time.The entrance hall contained a few last-minute stragglers, all leaving the
Great Hall after breakfast and heading through the double oak doors to watch
the second task. They stared as Harry flashed past, sending Colin and Dennis
Creevey flying as he leapt down the stone steps and out onto the bright morning. It was full of golden potion and the cork was still tightly
sealed with wax. “I wanted Ron to think I’d done it, so I faked it when I knew
you were looking.” He looked at Ron. “You saved everything because you felt
lucky. You did it all yourself.”
He pocketed the potion again.
“There really wasn’t anything in my pumpkin juice?” Ron said, astounded.
“But the weather’s good . . . and Vaisey couldn’t play. . . . I honestly haven’t
been given lucky potion?”
Harry shook his head. Ron gaped at him for a  fessor
Slughorn by force, and might do much more harm than good; I do not wish
him to leave Hogwarts. However, he has his weaknesses like the rest of us,
and I believe that you are the one person who might be able to penetrate his
defenses. It is most important that we secure the true memory, Harry. . . . How
important, we will only know when we have seen the real thing. So, good
luck . . . and good night.”
A little taken aback by the abrupt dismissal, Harry got to his feet quickly.
“Good night, sir.”
As he hed her essay on 
The Principles of Rematerialization

who was trying to read it upside down.
Harry looked at his watch and hurriedly put the old copy of 
Advanced

 back into his bag.
“It’s five to eight, I’d better go, I’ll be late for Dumbledore.”
“Ooooh!” gasped Hermione, looking up at once. “Good luck! We’ll wait
up, we want to hear what he teaches you!”
“Hope it goes okay,” said Ron, and the pair of them watched Harry leave
through the portrait hole.
Harry proceeded through letely clear potion. Harry stared at it.
“Do you know what this is, Potter?” Snape said, his eyes glittering
dangerously again.
“No,” said Harry, with complete honesty this time.
“It is Veritaserum — a Truth Potion so powerful that three drops would
have you spilling your innermost secrets for this entire class to hear,” said
Snape viciously. “Now, the use of this potion is controlled by very strict
Ministry guidelines. But unless you watch your step, you might just find that

how to reach it? This potion cannot be penetrated by hand, Vanished, parted,
scooped up, or siphoned away, nor can it be Transfigured, Charmed, or
otherwise made to change its nature.”
Almost absentmindedly, Dumbledore raised his wand again, twirled it once
in midair, and then caught the crystal goblet that he had conjured out of
nowhere.
“I can only conclude that this potion is supposed to be drunk.”
“What?” said Harry. “No!”

“Yeah . . . I — er . . . thanks,” said Harry weakly.
“What is this thing?” said Moody, drawing the Marauder’s Map out of his
pocket and unfolding it.
“Map of Hogwarts,” said Harry, hoping Moody was going to pull him out
of the staircase soon; his leg was really hurting him.
“Merlin’s beard,” Moody whispered, staring at the map, his magical eye
going haywire. “This . . . this is some map, Potter!”
“Yeah, it’s . . . quite useful,” Harry said. His eyes were starting to water
from the pain. “Er — Professor  every step — the Invisibility Cloak slipped — Harry snatched at it,

open, and began wailing loudly in the corridor below. Harry pulled out hiswand and struggled to touch the Marauder’s Map, to wipe it blank, but it was
too far away to reach —

Once out of sight of the entrance hall, Harry pulled the Marauder’s Map

it carefully.
As it was Sunday morning, nearly all the students were inside their various
common rooms, the Gryffindors in one tower, the Ravenclaws in another, the
Slytherins in the dungeons, and the Hufflepuffs in the basement near the

Who is the Triwizard champion from Beauxbatons?,Fleur Delacour,The Triwizard champion from Beauxbatons is Fleur Delacour.,".
Dear Sirius,
You told me to keep you posted on what’s happening at Hogwarts,
so here goes — 
I don’t know if you’ve heard, but the Triwizard
Tournament’s happening this year and on Saturday night I got
picked as a fourth champion. I don’t know who put my name in the
Goblet of Fire, because I didn’t. The other Hogwarts champion is
Cedric Diggory, from Hufflepuff.
He paused at this point, thinking. He had an urge to say something about
the large weight of anxiety that seemed to have settled inside his chest ance of the sign in the entrance hall had a marked effect upon
the inhabitants of the castle. During the following week, there seemed to be
only one topic of conversation, no matter where Harry went: the Triwizard
Tournament. Rumors were flying from student to student like highly
contagious germs: who was going to try for Hogwarts champion, what the
tournament would involve, how the students from Beauxbatons and
Durmstrang differed from themselves.
Harry noticed too that the castle seemed to be undergoing a ng them Hogwarts champion.” His light blueeyes twinkled as they flickered over Fred’s and George’s mutinous faces. “I
therefore beg you not to waste your time submitting yourself if you are under
seventeen.
“The delegations from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang will be arriving in
October and remaining with us for the greater part of this year. I know that
you will all extend every courtesy to our foreign guests while they are with
us, and will give your whole-hearted support to the Hogwarts champion when

Predictably, Malfoy arrived at Hagrid’s cabin with his familiar sneer firmly
in place.
“Ah, look, boys, it’s the champion,” he said to Crabbe and Goyle themoment he got within earshot of Harry. “Got your autograph books? Better
get a signature now, because I doubt he’s going to be around much longer. . . .
Half the Triwizard champions have died . . . how long d’you reckon you’re
going to last, Potter? Ten minutes into the first task’s my bet.”
Crabbe and Goyle guffawed sycophantically, but Malfo ld almost
taste it. The Hogwarts champion next . . .
And the Goblet of Fire turned red once more; sparks showered out of it; the
tongue of flame shot high into the air, and from its tip Dumbledore pulled the
third piece of parchment.
“The Hogwarts champion,” he called, “is Cedric Diggory!”
“No!” said Ron loudly, but nobody heard him except Harry; the uproar
from the next table was too great. Every single Hufflepuff had jumped to his
or her feet, screaming and stamping, as Cedric made his way past them,

 know will forgive me
for giving a short explanation, and allow their attention to wander freely.
“The Triwizard Tournament was first established some seven hundred years
ago as a friendly competition between the three largest European schools of
wizardry: Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, and Durmstrang. A champion was selected
to represent each school, and the three champions competed in three magical
tasks. The schools took it in turns to host the tournament once every five
years, and it was generally agreed to arkaroff, so loudly that everyone could hear
him, even over all the applause. “Knew you had it in you!”
The clapping and chatting died down. Now everyone’s attention was
focused again on the goblet, which, seconds later, turned red once more. A
second piece of parchment shot out of it, propelled by the flames.“The champion for Beauxbatons,” said Dumbledore, “is Fleur Delacour!”
“It’s her, Ron!” Harry shouted as the girl who so resembled a veela got
gracefully to her feet, shook back her sheet of silvery blo debating the ways in which Dumbledore might stop those who
were under seventeen from entering the tournament.
“Who’s this impartial judge who’s going to decide who the champions
are?” said Harry.
“Dunno,” said Fred, “but it’s them we’ll have to fool. I reckon a couple of
drops of Aging Potion might do it, George. . . .”
“Dumbledore knows you’re not of age, though,” said Ron.“Yeah, but he’s not the one who decides who the champion is, is he?” said
Fred shrewdly. “Sounds to me like once this judge knows who w"

“You see?” he whispered. “It was a name I was already using at Hogwarts,
to my most intimate friends only, of course. You think I was going to use my
filthy Muggle father’s name forever? I, in whose veins runs the blood of
Salazar Slytherin himself, through my mother’s side? I, keep the name of a
foul, common Muggle, who abandoned me even before I was born, just
because he found out his wife was a witch? No, Harry — I fashioned myself a
new name, a n d the boy, and said, “It

 real, isn’t it?
It’s not a joke? Petunia says you’re lying to me. Petunia says there isn’t a

is
 real, isn’t it?”
“It’s real for us,” said Snape. “Not for her. But we’ll get the letter, you and
me.”
“Really?” whispered Lily.
“Definitely,” said Snape, and even with his poorly cut hair and his odd
clothes, he struck an oddly impressive figure sprawled in front of her, brimful
of confidence in his destiny.
“And will it really come by owl?” Lily whispered.
“Normally,” h the picture
belonged; it was a rather dull story about interschool competitions.
“Her name was Eileen Prince. 
Prince,
 Harry.”
They looked at each other, and Harry realized what Hermione was trying to
say. He burst out laughing.
“No way.”
“What?”
“You think 
she
 was the Half-Blood . . . ? Oh, come on.”
“Well, why not? Harry, there aren’t any real princes in the Wizarding
world! It’s either a nickname, a made-up title somebody’s given themselves,
or it could be their actual name, couldn’t it? No, listen! ion, Harry. I’d say
she’d be very easy to lure into a trap.”
“So . . . so Voldemort could have found out about the tournament?” said
Harry. “Is that what you mean? You think Karkaroff might be here on his
orders?”
“I don’t know,” said Sirius slowly, “I just don’t know . . . Karkaroff doesn’t
strike me as the type who’d go back to Voldemort unless he knew Voldemort
was powerful enough to protect him. But whoever put your name in that
goblet did it for a reason, and I can’t help thinking the tournament would

He raised his glass as though toasting Voldemort, whose face remained
expressionless. Nevertheless, Harry felt the atmosphere in the room change
subtly: Dumbledore’s refusal to use Voldemort’s chosen name was a refusal to
allow Voldemort to dictate the terms of the meeting, and Harry could tell that
Voldemort took it as such.
“I am surprised you have remained here so long,” said Voldemort after a

happen. . . . They must show that Voldemort’s coming back. . . . Bane thinks
Firenze should have let Voldemort kill me. . . . I suppose that’s written in the
stars as well.”
“Will you stop saying the name!”
 Ron hissed.
“So all I’ve got to wait for now is Snape to steal the Stone,” Harry went on
feverishly, “then Voldemort will be able to come and finish me off. . . . Well, I
suppose Bane’ll be happy.”
Hermione looked very frightened, but she had a word of comfort.
“Harry, everyone sa ngs that
are worst for them.”
Harry lay there, lost for words. Dumbledore hummed a little and smiled at
the ceiling.
“Sir?” said Harry. “I’ve been thinking . . . Sir — even if the Stone’s gone,
Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who —”
“Call him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper name for things. Fear
of a name increases fear of the thing itself.”
“Yes, sir. Well, Voldemort’s going to try other ways of coming back, isn’t
he? I mean, he hasn’t gone, has he?”
“No, Harry, he has not. He is still out there somewhere,  ” said Harry, shocked to see Hagrid shaking with grief and
remorse, great tears leaking down into his beard. “Hagrid, he’d have found
out somehow, this is Voldemort we’re talking about, he’d have found out even
if you hadn’t told him.”
“Yeh could’ve died!” sobbed Hagrid. “An’ don’ say the name!”
“VOLDEMORT!” Harry bellowed, and Hagrid was so shocked, he stopped
crying. “I’ve met him and I’m calling him by his name. Please cheer up,

You mean that you did magic without meaning to; you reacted instinctively.”
“No,” said Harry. “The bike was falling, I couldn’t have told you where
Voldemort was, but my wand spun in my hand and found him and shot a spell
at him, and it wasn’t even a spell I recognized. I’ve never made gold flames
appear before.”
“Often,” said Mr. Weasley, “when you’re in a pressured situation you can
produce magic you never dreamed of. Small children often find, before
they’re trai lt a creeping chill behind him that could mean only
one thing. There was more than one.
“DUDLEY, KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT! WHATEVER YOU DO,

flying over the ground like spiders. “Where’s — wand — come on —

He said the spell automatically, desperate for light to help him in his search

slumped sideways, unconscious. His companion, unable to see who had cast

and bound Ron head to foot — the waitress screamed and ran for the door —

“Let’s not stay long,” Ron said quietly.
The Healer pointed her wand at the door of the Janus Thickey ward and
muttered 
“Alohomora.” 
The door swung open and she led the way inside,
keeping a firm grasp on Gilderoy’s arm until she had settled him into an
armchair beside his bed.

and Ginny in a low voice. “For permanent spell damage, you know. Of
course, with intensive remedial potions and charms and a bit of luck, we can

different hex. Nor were they the only ones to have done so.
“Thought we’d see what those three were up to,” said Fred matter-of-factly,
stepping onto Goyle and into the compartment. He had his wand out, and so
did George, who was careful to tread on Malfoy as he followed Fred inside.
“Interesting effect,” said George, looking down at Crabbe. “Who used the
Furnunculus Curse?”
“Me,” said Harry.
“Odd,” said George lightly. “I used Jelly-Legs. Looks as t y just remembered.
“What?” said Ron and Hermione together.
“My dad used this spell,” said Harry. “I — Lupin told me.”
This last part was not true; in fact, Harry had seen his father use the spell
on Snape, but he had never told Ron and Hermione about that particular
excursion into the Pensieve. Now, however, a wonderful possibility occurred
to him. Could the Half-Blood Prince possibly be — ?
“Maybe your dad did use it, Harry,” said Hermione, “but he’s not the only
one. We’ve seen a whole bunch of people use arry. “They set up that spell to tell
them we’d come. I reckon they’ve done something to keep us here, trap us

“What about dementors?” called another Death Eater. “Let ’em have free

“The Dark Lord wants Potter dead by no hand but his —”
“— an’ dementors won’t kill him! The Dark Lord wants Potter’s life, not
his soul. He’ll be easier to kill if he’s been Kissed first!”
There were noises of agreement. Dread filled Harry: To repel dementors
they would have to produce Pat ther he could make out his fingers when it
happened.
A bright silver light appeared right ahead of him, moving through the trees.
Whatever the source, it was moving soundlessly. The light seemed simply to
drift toward him.
He jumped to his feet, his voice frozen in his throat, and raised Hermione’s
wand. He screwed up his eyes as the light became blinding, the trees in front
of it pitch-black in silhouette, and still the thing came closer. . . .
And then the source of the light stepped out from behind an oa"

backed out of number four’s drive.
It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something
peculiar — a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn’t realize what
he had seen — then he jerked his head around to look again. There was a
tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn’t a map in
sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the
light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on
the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a
statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didn’t
so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two
owls swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved
at all.
A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so
suddenly and silently you’d have thought he’d just popped out of the ground.
 on here? What’s going on?”
Attracted no doubt by Malfoy’s shout, Argus Filch came
shouldering his way through the crowd. Then he saw Mrs. Norris and fell
back, clutching his face in horror.
“My cat! My cat! What’s happened to Mrs. Norris?” he shrieked.
And his popping eyes fell on Harry.
“You!”
 he screeched. “
You!
 You’ve murdered my cat! You’ve killed her!
I’ll kill you! I’ll —”
“Argus!”
Dumbledore had arrived on the scene, followed by a number of other
teachers. In seconds, he had swept past Harry, Ron, rs of his name rearranged
themselves:
I AM LORD VOLDEMORT
“You see?” he whispered. “It was a name I was already using at Hogwarts,
to my most intimate friends only, of course. You think I was going to use my
filthy Muggle father’s name forever? I, in whose veins runs the blood of
Salazar Slytherin himself, through my mother’s side? I, keep the name of a
foul, common Muggle, who abandoned me even before I was born, just
because he found out his wife was a witch? No, Harry — I fashioned myself a
new name, a n lbus Dumbledore.
Albus Dumbledore didn’t seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street
where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He was busy
rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But he did seem to realize he
was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still
staring at him from the other end of the street. For some reason, the sight of
the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and muttered, “I should have
known.”
He found what he was looking for in  ssaging his head.
“What 
was
 that?”
“It was either a very big cat or quite a small tiger,” said Harry.
“Where’s Hermione?”
“Probably getting her owl —”
They made their way back up the crowded street to the Magical Menagerie.
As they reached it, Hermione came out, but she wasn’t carrying an owl. Her
arms were clamped tightly around the enormous ginger cat.
“You 
bought
 that monster?” said Ron, his mouth hanging open.
“He’s 
gorgeous,
 isn’t he?” said Hermione, glowing.
That was a matter of opinion, thought —
and it didn’t improve his mood — was the tabby cat he’d spotted that
morning. It was now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the same
one; it had the same markings around its eyes.
“Shoo!” said Mr. Dursley loudly.
The cat didn’t move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this normal cat
behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. Trying to pull himself together, he let
himself into the house. He was still determined not to mention anything to his
wife.
Mrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him ov  Harry. The cat’s ginger fur was thick
and fluffy, but it was definitely a bit bowlegged and its face looked grumpy
and oddly squashed, as though it had run headlong into a brick wall. Now that
Scabbers was out of sight, however, the cat was purring contentedly in
Hermione’s arms.
“Hermione, that thing nearly scalped me!” said Ron.
“He didn’t mean to, did you, Crookshanks?” said Hermione.
“And what about Scabbers?” said Ron, pointing at the lump in his chest
pocket. “He needs rest and relaxation! How’s he g"
What magical plant does Harry use to breathe underwater in the Triwizard Tournament?,Gillyweed,"I think I can help you with that!

According to the context, Harry uses a magical plant called ""Mimbulus"" to breathe underwater in the Triwizard Tournament.","without their noticing.
Hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on
her. Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off
them, but the more they strained against it, the tighter and faster the plant
wound around them.
“Stop moving!” Hermione ordered them. “I know what this is — it’s
Devil’s Snare!”
“Oh, I’m so glad we know what it’s called, that’s a great help,” snarled
Ron, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck.
“Shut up, I’m d him.
“I’ve got to go and look for people who can’t use their voices above the
ground. . . .” he said slowly. “Er . . . who could that be?”
“Slow, aren’t you?”
He had never seen Moaning Myrtle so cheerful, apart from the day when a
dose of Polyjuice Potion had given Hermione the hairy face and tail of a cat.
Harry stared around the bathroom, thinking . . . if the voices could only be
heard underwater, then it made sense for them to belong to underwater
creatures. He ran this theory past Myrtle, who smirked s affected you?”
“Er,” said Harry, yet again.
“Do you think that the trauma in your past might have made you keen to
prove yourself? To live up to your name? Do you think that perhaps you were
tempted to enter the Triwizard Tournament because —”
“I didn’t enter,”
 said Harry, starting to feel irritated.
“Can you remember your parents at all?” said Rita Skeeter, talking over
him.
“No,” said Harry.
“How do you think they’d feel if they knew you were competing in the
Triwizard Tournament? Proud? Worried? Angry l out with me —”
“Come off it,” said Harry, looking around to check that they couldn’t be
overheard, but the grounds were quite deserted. “He came back to the country
just because my scar twinged. He’ll probably come bursting right into the
castle if I tell him someone’s entered me in the Triwizard Tournament —”
“He’d want you to tell him,”
 said Hermione sternly. “He’s going to find out
anyway —”
“How?”
“Harry, this isn’t going to be kept quiet,” said Hermione, very seriously.
“This tournament’s famous, an trout, busy over the Christmas period,
overlooked the dangers of the plant on Mr. Bode’s bedside table. As his
speech and mobility improved, Healer Strout encouraged Mr. Bode to
look after the plant himself, unaware that it was not an innocent
Flitterbloom, but a cutting of Devil’s Snare, which, when touched by the
convalescent Mr. Bode, throttled him instantly.
“St. Mungo’s is as yet unable to account for the presence of the plant
on the ward and asks any witch or wizard with information to come
forward.”
 ryone in the Great Hall followed suit. They murmured his name, as
they had murmured Cedric’s, and drank to him. But through a gap in the
standing figures, Harry saw that Malfoy, Crabbe, Goyle, and many of the
other Slytherins had remained defiantly in their seats, their goblets untouched.Dumbledore, who after all possessed no magical eye, did not see them.
When everyone had once again resumed their seats, Dumbledore
continued, “The Triwizard Tournament’s aim was to further and promote
magical understanding. oke. Nearly everyone laughed, and Dumbledore chuckled appreciatively.
“I am 
not
 joking, Mr. Weasley,” he said, “though now that you mention it, I
did hear an excellent one over the summer about a troll, a hag, and a
leprechaun who all go into a bar . . .”
Professor McGonagall cleared her throat loudly.
“Er — but maybe this is not the time . . . no . . .” said Dumbledore, “where
was I? Ah yes, the Triwizard Tournament . . . well, some of you will not know
what this tournament involves, so I hope those who  oped they wouldn’thave to resort to that — Filch would skin them alive.
In the meantime, life became even worse for Harry within the confines of
the castle, for Rita Skeeter had published her piece about the Triwizard
Tournament, and it had turned out to be not so much a report on the
tournament as a highly colored life story of Harry. Much of the front page had
been given over to a picture of Harry; the article (continuing on pages two,
six, and seven) had been all about Harry, the names of the Beauxbatons"

He revealed this to Harry, saying ""I killed my father"" and ""I watched Potter run into the castle. He met Snape. Dumbledore joined them.""","ed his throat; it was dry from panic and the smoke.
“Hagrid, he killed . . .”
“Killed?” said Hagrid loudly, staring down at Harry. “Snape killed?
What’re yeh on abou’, Harry?”
“Dumbledore,” said Harry. “Snape killed . . . Dumbledore.”
Hagrid simply looked at him, the little of his face that could be seen
completely blank, uncomprehending.
“Dumbledore wha’, Harry?”
“He’s dead. Snape killed him. . . .”
“Don’ say that,” said Hagrid roughly. “Snape kill Dumbledore — don’ be
stupid, Harry. Wha’s made yeh say tha is killed him! You is killed Master’s son!”
“He is simply Stunned, Winky,” said Dumbledore. “Step aside, please.
Severus, you have the potion?”
Snape handed Dumbledore a small glass bottle of completely clear liquid:
the Veritaserum with which he had threatened Harry in class. Dumbledore got
up, bent over the man on the floor, and pulled him into a sitting position
against the wall beneath the Foe-Glass, in which the reflections of
Dumbledore, Snape, and McGonagall were still glaring down upon them all.
Win uld not hurt
Potter; my master needed him. Potter ran to get Dumbledore. I Stunned Krum.

“Noooo!”
 wailed Winky. “Master Barty, Master Barty, what is you

“You killed your father,” Dumbledore said, in the same soft voice. “Whatdid you do with the body?”
“Carried it into the forest. Covered it with the Invisibility Cloak. I had the
map with me. I watched Potter run into the castle. He met Snape. Dumbledore
joined them. I watched Potter bringing Dumbledore out of the castle. I wal one’s unconscious, bud we could feel a bulse —”
There was a loud bang and a yell from behind the dais. Harry saw
Kingsley, yelling in pain, hit the ground. Bellatrix Lestrange turned tail and
ran as Dumbledore whipped around. He aimed a spell at her but she deflected
it. She was halfway up the steps now —“Harry — no!” cried Lupin, but Harry had already ripped his arm from
Lupin’s slackened grip.
“SHE KILLED SIRIUS!” bellowed Harry. “SHE KILLED HIM — I’LL
KILL HER!”
And he was off, scrambling up the stone be lors, who thought he
had the right idea about things. . . . They got cold feet when they saw what he
was prepared to do to get power, though. But I bet my parents thought
Regulus was a right little hero for joining up at first.”
“Was he killed by an Auror?” Harry asked tentatively.
“Oh no,” said Sirius. “No, he was murdered by Voldemort. Or onVoldemort’s orders, more likely, I doubt Regulus was ever important enough
to be killed by Voldemort in person. From what I found out after he died, he
got in so far,  e. He knew what the dementor must have done. It had administered its
fatal Kiss to Barty Crouch. It had sucked his soul out through his mouth. He
was worse than dead.
“By all accounts, he is no loss!” blustered Fudge. “It seems he has been
responsible for several deaths!”
“But he cannot now give testimony, Cornelius,” said Dumbledore. He was
staring hard at Fudge, as though seeing him plainly for the first time. “He
cannot give evidence about why he killed those people.”
“Why he killed them? Well, that’s no ry yelled. “HE WAS THEIR SECRET-
KEEPER! HE SAID SO BEFORE YOU TURNED UP. HE SAID HE
KILLED THEM!”
He was pointing at Black, who shook his head slowly; the sunken eyes
were suddenly overbright.
“Harry . . . I as good as killed them,” he croaked. “I persuaded Lily and
James to change to Peter at the last moment, persuaded them to use him as
Secret-Keeper instead of me. . . . I’m to blame, I know it. . . . The night they
died, I’d arranged to check on Peter, make sure he was still safe, but when I

A voice issued from his own mouth, a high, cold voice empty of any human
kindness, “Take it for me. . . . Lift it down, now. . . . I cannot touc do you know?” said Ron.
Harry shook his head and covered his eyes with his hands, pressing down
upon them with his palms. Little stars erupted in them. He felt Ron sit down
on the bench beside him and knew Ron was staring at him.
“Is this what it was about last time?” said Ron in a hushed voice. “When
your scar hurt in Umbridge’s office? You-Know-Who was angry?”
Harry shook his head.
“What is it, then?”
Harry was thinking himself back. He had been looking into Umbridge’s
face. . . . His scar had hurt . . .  th behind him told him they were
Hermione’s.
“What?” she whispered.
“Dumbledore never told you that the reason you bear that scar was hidden
in the bowels of the Department of Mysteries?” said Malfoy sneeringly.
“I — what?” said Harry, and for a moment he quite forgot his plan. “What
about my scar?”
“What?” 
whispered Hermione more urgently behind him.
“Can this be?” said Malfoy, sounding maliciously delighted; some of the
Death Eaters were laughing again, and under cover of their laughter, Harry
hissed to  of minutes.
Dumbledore stopped pacing and looked at Harry.
“My apologies,” he said quietly. He sat back down at his desk.
“D’you — d’you know why my scar’s hurting me?”
Dumbledore looked very intently at Harry for a moment, and then said, “I
have a theory, no more than that. . . . It is my belief that your scar hurts both
when Lord Voldemort is near you, and when he is feeling a particularly strong
surge of hatred.”
“But . . . why?”
“Because you and he are connected by the curse that failed,” said
Dumbledor  rising up to the ceiling. Harry raised his wand, but as he did so, his
scar seared more painfully, more powerfully than it had done in years.
“He’s coming! 
Hermione, he’s coming!
”As he yelled the snake fell, hissing wildly. Everything was chaos: It
smashed shelves from the wall, and splintered china flew everywhere as
Harry jumped over the bed and seized the dark shape he knew to be Hermione

She shrieked with pain as he pulled her back across the bed: The snake
reared again, but Harry knew that worse t nly qualified a year ago. Nearly failed on Stealth and
Tracking, I’m dead clumsy, did you hear me break that plate when we arrived

“Can you learn how to be a Metamorphmagus?” Harry asked her,
straightening up, completely forgetting about packing.
Tonks chuckled.
“Bet you wouldn’t mind hiding that scar sometimes, eh?”
Her eyes found the lightning-shaped scar on Harry’s forehead.
“No, I wouldn’t mind,” Harry mumbled, turning away. He did not like
people staring at his scar.
“Well, you’ll have to  arding world.
Harry looked nothing like the rest of the family. Uncle Vernon was large
and neckless, with an enormous black mustache; Aunt Petunia was horse-
faced and bony; Dudley was blond, pink, and porky. Harry, on the other hand,
was small and skinny, with brilliant green eyes and jet-black hair that was
always untidy. He wore round glasses, and on his forehead was a thin,
lightning-shaped scar.
It was this scar that made Harry so particularly unusual, even for a wizard.
This scar was the only hint of "

“And mine could be going the same way!” yelled Ron.

noise of contempt he turned on his heel, vaulted into bed, and pulled the
hangings shut with such violence that they were ripped from the bed and fell
in a dusty pile to the floor. Ron glared at Seamus, then looked at Dean and
Neville.
“Anyone else’s parents got a problem with Harry?” he said aggressively.
“My parents are Muggles, mate,” said Dean, shrugging. “They don’t know
nothing about no deaths at Hogwarts, because I’m not stupid enough to tell
them.”
“You don’t know my mother, she’ll weasel  ape

Neville’s parents, ever achieved.”
“Why did he do it, then?” said Harry, who felt numb and cold. “Why did he
try and kill me as a baby? He should have waited to see whether Neville or I
looked more dangerous when we were older and tried to kill whoever it was
then —”
“That might, indeed, have been the more practical course,” said
Dumbledore, “except that Voldemort’s information about the prophecy was
incomplete. The Hog’s Hea k

Dudley’s hands jerked upward to cover his mouth. With his parents’ and
Harry’s eyes upon him, he slowly lowered them again and asked, “There
are . . . more of them?”
“More?” laughed Harry. “More than the two that attacked us, you mean?
Of course there are, there are hundreds, maybe thousands by this time, seeing
as they feed off fear and despair —”
“All right, all right,” blustered Vernon Dursley. “You’ve made your point
—”
“I hope so,” said Harry, “because once I’m seventeen, all of them — Dea  the end of July, nearly
sixteen years ago. This boy would be born to parents who had already defied
Voldemort three times.”
Harry felt as though something was closing in upon him. His breathing
seemed difficult again.
“It means — me?”
Dumbledore took a deep breath.
“The odd thing is, Harry,” he said softly, “that it may not have meant you at
all. Sybill’s prophecy could have applied to two wizard boys, both born at the
end of July that year, both of whom had parents in the Order of the Phoenix,
both sets o s had died . . . exactly like that spider. Had they
been unblemished and unmarked too? Had they simply seen the flash of green
light and heard the rush of speeding death, before life was wiped from their
bodies?
Harry had been picturing his parents’ deaths over and over again for three
years now, ever since he’d found out they had been murdered, ever since he’d
found out what had happened that night: Wormtail had betrayed his parents’
whereabouts to Voldemort, who had come to find them at their cottage. How ?”
Harry was feeling really annoyed now. How on earth was he to know how
his parents would feel if they were alive? He could feel Rita Skeeter watching
him very intently. Frowning, he avoided her gaze and looked down at words
the quill had just written:
Tears fill those startlingly green eyes as our conversation turns to
the parents he can barely remember.
“I have NOT got tears in my eyes!” said Harry loudly.
Before Rita Skeeter could say a word, the door of the broom cupboard was
pulled open. Harry looked  ne, frowning, “you’re married! How does she feel
about you going away with us?”
“Tonks will be perfectly safe,” said Lupin. “She’ll be at her parents’
house.”
There was something strange in Lupin’s tone; it was almost cold. There
was also something odd in the idea of Tonks remaining hidden at her parents’
house; she was, after all, a member of the Order and, as far as Harry knew,
was likely to want to be in the thick of the action.
“Remus,” said Hermione tentatively, “is everything all right . . . you

tickled them in exactly the right place, and doors that weren’t really doors at

refused to talk at all if Harry had used the 
Muffliato
 spell on anyone in the
vicinity.
Sitting up in bed, Harry turned the book sideways so as to examine more
closely the scribbled instructions for a spell that seemed to have caused the
Prince some trouble. There were many crossings-out and alterations, but
finally, crammed into a corner of the page, the scribble:

“Oh, that one had a great vogue during my time at Hogwarts,” said Lupin
reminiscently. “There were a few months in my fifth year when you couldn’t
move for being hoisted into the air by your ankle.”
“My dad used it,” said Harry. “I saw him in the Pensieve, he used it on
Snape.”
He tried to sound casual, as though this was a throwaway comment of no
real importance, but h ore’s Army had used to send one another
messages.
“These have been great,” said Neville, beaming at Hermione. “The
Carrows never rumbled how we were communicating, it drove them mad. We
used to sneak out at night and put graffiti on the walls: 
Dumbledore’s Army,
Still Recruiting,
 stuff like that. Snape hated it.”
“You 
used to

“Well, it got more difficult as time went on,” said Neville. “We lost Luna at
Christmas, and Ginny never came back after Easter, and t ed, 
“Stupefy!”
The great blond Death Eater was hit in the face by a jet of red light: He
slumped sideways, unconscious. His companion, unable to see who had cast
the spell, fired another at Ron: Shining black ropes flew from his wand-tip
and bound Ron head to foot — the waitress screamed and ran for the door —

What does the Imperius Curse do?,Controls the victim,"The Imperius Curse is a powerful spell that allows the caster to control the actions of the victim, making them do their bidding as if they were acting of their own free will.","ne of your throats . . .”
Ron gave an involuntary shudder.
“Years back, there were a lot of witches and wizards being controlled by
the Imperius Curse,” said Moody, and Harry knew he was talking about the
days in which Voldemort had been all-powerful. “Some job for the Ministry,
trying to sort out who was being forced to act, and who was acting of their
own free will.
“The Imperius Curse can be fought, and I’ll be teaching you how, but it
takes real strength of character, and not everyone’s got it. Better a  a raid on his
Clapham home . . .’”
“Stan Shunpike, a Death Eater?” said Harry, remembering the spotty youth
he had first met three years before. “No way!”
“He might have been put under the Imperius Curse,” said Ron reasonably.
“You never can tell.”
“It doesn’t look like it,” said Hermione, who was still reading. “It says here
he was arrested after he was overheard talking about the Death Eaters’ secret
plans in a pub.” She looked up with a troubled expression on her face. “If he
was under the Imperius Curs t.
Mungo’s, his brain had gone all funny and he couldn’t talk. But remember
what the Healer told us? He was recovering. And they couldn’t risk him
getting better, could they? I mean, the shock of whatever happened when he
touched that weapon probably made the Imperius Curse lift. Once he’d got his
voice back, he’d explain what he’d been doing, wouldn’t he? They would
have known he’d been sent to steal the weapon. Of course, it would have been
easy for Lucius Malfoy to put the curse on him. Never out of the  ate step. He
had had much more difficulty with the curse than Harry, though Moodyassured him the effects would wear off by lunchtime. “Talk about
paranoid . . .” Ron glanced nervously over his shoulder to check that Moody
was definitely out of earshot and went on. “No wonder they were glad to get
shot of him at the Ministry. Did you hear him telling Seamus what he did to
that witch who shouted ‘Boo’ behind him on April Fools’ Day? And when are
we supposed to read up on resisting the Imperius Curse with ever law?”
Several hands rose tentatively into the air, including Ron’s and Hermione’s.
Moody pointed at Ron, though his magical eye was still fixed on Lavender.
“Er,” said Ron tentatively, “my dad told me about one. . . . Is it called theImperius Curse, or something?”
“Ah, yes,” said Moody appreciatively. “Your father 
would
 know that one.
Gave the Ministry a lot of trouble at one time, the Imperius Curse.”
Moody got heavily to his mismatched feet, opened his desk drawer, and
took out a glass jar. Three large  eted. Harry fully expected to receive low marks
on his, because he had disagreed with Snape on the best way to tackle
dementors, but he did not care: Slughorn’s memory was the most important
thing to him now.
“I’m telling you, the stupid Prince isn’t going to be able to help you with
this, Harry!” said Hermione, more loudly. “There’s only one way to force
someone to do what you want, and that’s the Imperius Curse, which is illegal
—”
“Yeah, I know that, thanks,” said Harry, not looking up from the book.
“Th  foggy shapes were moving in the Foe-Glass on the wall.
“You were so long in that lake, Potter, I thought you had drowned. But
luckily, Dumbledore took your idiocy for nobility, and marked you high for it.
I breathed again.
“You had an easier time of it than you should have in that maze tonight, of
course,” said Moody. “I was patrolling around it, able to see through the outer
hedges, able to curse many obstacles out of your way. I Stunned Fleur
Delacour as she passed. I put the Imperius Curse on Krum, so t students forward in turn and put the Imperius
Curse upon them. Harry watched as, one by one, his classmates did the most
extraordinary things under its influence. Dean Thomas hopped three times
around the room, singing the national anthem. Lavender Brown imitated a
squirrel. Neville performed a series of quite astonishing gymnastics he would
certainly not have been capable of in his normal state. Not one of them
seemed to be able to fight off the curse, and each of them recovered only

who was trying to read it upside down.
Harry looked at his watch and hurriedly put the old copy of 
Advanced
Potion-Making
 back into his bag.
“It’s five to eight, I’d better go, I’ll be late for Dumbledore.”
“Ooooh!” gasped Hermione, looking up at once. “Good luck! We’ll wait
up, we want to hear what he teaches you!”
“Hope it goes okay,” said Ron, and the pair of them watched Harry leave
through the portrait hole.
Harry proceeded through rts, except now it’s just the Dark Arts. We’re supposed to practice the
Cruciatus Curse on people who’ve earned detentions —”
“What?”
Harry, Ron, and Hermione’s united voices echoed up and down the
passage.
“Yeah,” said Neville. “That’s how I got this one,” he pointed at a
particularly deep gash in his cheek, “I refused to do it. Some people are into
it, though; Crabbe and Goyle love it. First time they’ve ever been top in
anything, I expect.
“Alecto, Amycus’s sister, teaches Muggle Studies, which is compul very important!” said Hermione, shocked.
“Not the way Lockhart teaches it,” said Ron. “I haven’t learned anything
from him except not to set pixies loose.”
Neville Longbottom had been sent letters from all the witches and wizards
in his family, all giving him different advice on what to choose. Confused and
worried, he sat reading the subject lists with his tongue poking out, asking
people whether they thought Arithmancy sounded more difficult than Study
of Ancient Runes. Dean Thomas, who, like Harry, had g “Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder he’s looking so
nervous, that’s Professor Snape. He teaches Potions, but he doesn’t want to —
everyone knows he’s after Quirrell’s job. Knows an awful lot about the Dark
Arts, Snape.”
Harry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn’t look at him again.
At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to his
feet again. The hall fell silent.
“Ahem — just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I
have a few start-of-term notice he teaches?” said Ron, frowning at Professor Lupin’s pallid
profile.
“That’s obvious,” whispered Hermione. “There’s only one vacancy, isn’t
there? Defense Against the Dark Arts.”
Harry, Ron, and Hermione had already had two Defense Against the Dark
Arts teachers, both of whom had lasted only one year. There were rumors that
the job was jinxed.
“Well, I hope he’s up to it,” said Ron doubtfully. “He looks like one good
hex would finish him off, doesn’t he? Anyway . . .” He turned to Harry.
“What were you goin his face as he spoke. “Do you know about the Carrows?”
“Those two Death Eaters who teach here?”
“They do more than teach,” said Neville. “They’re in charge of all
discipline. They like punishment, the Carrows.”
“Like Umbridge?”
“Nah, they make her look tame. The other teachers are all supposed to refer
us to the Carrows if we do anything wrong. They don’t, though, if they can
avoid it. You can tell they all hate them as much as we do.
“Amycus, the bloke, he teaches what used to be Defense Against the Dark
A inny,” said Ron, whose ears were now reddening.
“

“Five points from Gryffindor!” Percy said tersely, fingering his prefect
badge. “And I hope it teaches you a lesson! No more 
detective work,
 or I’ll
write to Mum!”
And he strode off, the back of his neck as red as Ron’s ears.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione chose seats as far as possible from Percy in the
common room that night. Ron was still in a very bad temper and kept blotting
his Cha  friends.
“Hi,” said Harry. “How’re you? You’re staying at Hogwarts, then? I heard
your parents wanted you to leave.”
“I managed to talk them out of it for the time being,” said Parvati. “That
Katie thing really freaked them out, but as there hasn’t been anything
since . . . Oh, hi, Hermione!”
Parvati positively beamed. Harry could tell that she was feeling guilty for
having laughed at Hermione in Transfiguration. He looked around and saw
that Hermione was beaming back, if possible even more brightly. Girls"
What does the Polyjuice Potion do?,Transforms the drinker into someone else,"The Polyjuice Potion is a magical potion that allows the drinker to transform into someone else, as long as they have a sample of that person's hair or nail clippings. It is a complex potion that requires a combination of ingredients, including a bicorn horn and a boomslang skin, to be effective.","ng. . . .”
“Yeah, that is weird,” said Harry, frowning. “I heard him telling Crabbe it
wasn’t Crabbe’s business what he was doing . . . so what’s he telling all
these . . . all these . . .”
Harry’s voice tailed away; he was staring at the fire.
“God, I’ve been stupid,” he said quietly. “It’s obvious, isn’t it? There was a
great vat of it down in the dungeon. . . . He could’ve nicked some any time
during that lesson. . . .”
“Nicked what?” said Ron.
“Polyjuice Potion. He stole some of the Polyjuice Potion Slu w did you escape from Azkaban?”
Crouch took a deep, shuddering breath, then began to speak in a flat,
expressionless voice.
“My mother saved me. She knew she was dying. She persuaded my father
to rescue me as a last favor to her. He loved her as he had never loved me. He
agreed. They came to visit me. They gave me a draught of Polyjuice Potion
containing one of my mother’s hairs. She took a draught of Polyjuice Potion
containing one of my hairs. We took on each other’s appearance.”
Winky was shaking her hea that
Malfoy was staying, which struck them as very suspicious. The holidays
would be the perfect time to use the Polyjuice Potion and try to worm a
confession out of him.
Unfortunately, the potion was only half finished. They still needed the
bicorn horn and the boomslang skin, and the only place they were going to get
them was from Snape’s private stores. Harry privately felt he’d rather face
Slytherin’s legendary monster than let Snape catch him robbing his office.
“What we need,” said Hermione briskly as  a month or so, you feel like explaining, you will let us know, won’t
you?” said Ron irritably.
“All right,” said Hermione coldly. “What we’d need to do is to get inside
the Slytherin common room and ask Malfoy a few questions without him
realizing it’s us.”
“But that’s impossible,” Harry said as Ron laughed.
“No, it’s not,” said Hermione. “All we’d need would be some Polyjuice
Potion.”
“What’s that?” said Ron and Harry together.
“Snape mentioned it in class a few weeks ago —”
“D’you think we’ve got nothing iserably. “You used to be in there
all the time.”
This was true, though only because Harry, Ron, and Hermione had found
Myrtle’s out-of-order toilets a convenient place to brew Polyjuice Potion in
secret — a forbidden potion that had turned him and Ron into living replicas
of Crabbe and Goyle for an hour, so that they could sneak into the Slytherin
common room.
“I got told off for going in there,” said Harry, which was half-true; Percy
had once caught him coming out of Myrtle’s bathroom. “I thought I’d bett u, Harry, whether there is anything you’d like to tell me,” he
said gently. “Anything at all.”
Harry didn’t know what to say. He thought of Malfoy shouting, “You’ll be
next, Mudbloods!” and of the Polyjuice Potion simmering away in Moaning
Myrtle’s bathroom. Then he thought of the disembodied voice he had heard
twice and remembered what Ron had said: 
“Hearing voices no one else can
hear isn’t a good sign, even in the Wizarding world.”
 He thought, too, about
what everyone was saying about him, and his grow oom.”
“Or someone who looked like a girl or a woman,” said Harry. “Don’t
forget, there was a cauldron full of Polyjuice Potion at Hogwarts. We know
some of it got stolen. . . .”
In his mind’s eye, he watched a parade of Crabbes and Goyles prance past,
all transformed into girls.
“I think I’m going to take another swig of Felix,” said Harry, “and have a
go at the Room of Requirement again.”“That would be a complete waste of potion,” said Hermione flatly, putting
down the copy of 
Spellman’s Syllabary
 she ha rky brown.
“Hang on,” said Harry as Ron and Hermione reached for their glasses.
“We’d better not all drink them in here. . . . Once we turn into Crabbe and
Goyle we won’t fit. And Millicent Bulstrode’s no pixie.”
“Good thinking,” said Ron, unlocking the door. “We’ll take separate stalls.”
Careful not to spill a drop of his Polyjuice Potion, Harry slipped into the
middle stall.
“Ready?” he called.
“Ready,” came Ron’s and Hermione’s voices.
“One — two — three —”
Pinching his nose, Harry drank the potion down "

“No,” he said. “

 was the snake . . . or the snake was her . . . all along.”
“W-what?”
He closed his eyes. He could still smell Bathilda’s house on him: It made
the whole thing horribly vivid.
“Bathilda must’ve been dead a while. The snake was . . . was inside her.
You-Know-Who put it there in Godric’s Hollow, to wait. You were right. He
knew I’d go back.”
“The snake was

He opened hi ot know how I got there.”
Harry hardly dared believe her, yet his heart was lightening almost in spite
of himself.
“That dream I had about your dad and the snake, though —”
“Harry, you’ve had these dreams before,” Hermione said. “You had flashes
of what Voldemort was up to last year.”
“This was different,” said Harry, shaking his head. “I was inside that snake.
It was like I 
was
 the snake. . . . What if Voldemort somehow transported me
to London — ?”
“One day,” said Hermione, sounding thoroughly exasperat serpent, which relinquished its hold
upon Voldemort at once and turned, hissing furiously, to face Dumbledore.
Voldemort vanished. The snake reared from the floor, ready to strike —
There was a burst of flame in midair above Dumbledore just as Voldemort
reappeared, standing on the plinth in the middle of the pool where so recently
the five statues had stood.
“Look out!” 
Harry yelled.
But even as he shouted, one more jet of green light had flown at
Dumbledore from Voldemort’s wand and the snake had struck — rs of his name rearranged
themselves:
I AM LORD VOLDEMORT
“You see?” he whispered. “It was a name I was already using at Hogwarts,
to my most intimate friends only, of course. You think I was going to use my
filthy Muggle father’s name forever? I, in whose veins runs the blood of
Salazar Slytherin himself, through my mother’s side? I, keep the name of a
foul, common Muggle, who abandoned me even before I was born, just
because he found out his wife was a witch? No, Harry — I fashioned myself a
new name, a n e getting
to the bottom of this business. He had moved forward in his chair so that,
without realizing it, he was perched on the very edge, tense as though poised
for flight.
“How come I saw through the snake’s eyes if it’s Voldemort’s thoughts I’m
sharing?”
“Do not say the Dark Lord’s name!” 
spat Snape.
There was a nasty silence. They glared at each other across the Pensieve.
“Professor Dumbledore says his name,” said Harry quietly.
“Dumbledore is an extremely powerful wizard,” Snape muttered. “While

curious for a while about the behavior of the snake, Nagini?”
“The snake?” said Harry, startled. “You can use animals as Horcruxes?”
“Well, it is inadvisable to do so,” said Dumbledore, “because to confide a
part of your soul to something that can think and move for itself is obviouslya very risky business. However, if my calculations are correct, Voldemort was
still at least one Horcrux short of his goal of six when he entered  let’s go to Albania. Shouldn’t take more than an afternoon to search

“There can’t be anything there. He’d already made five of his Horcruxes
before he went into exile, and Dumbledore was certain the snake is the sixth,”
said Hermione. “We know the snake’s not in Albania, it’s usually with Vol

“Didn’t I ask you to stop saying that?”
“Fine! The snake is usually with

“Not particularly.”
“I can’t see him hiding anything at Borgin and Burke 
come a time when Lord Voldemort will seem to fear for the life of his snake.”
“For Nagini?” Snape looked astonished.
“Precisely. If there comes a time when Lord Voldemort stops sending that
snake forth to do his bidding, but keeps it safe beside him under magicalprotection, then, I think, it will be safe to tell Harry.”
“Tell him what?”
Dumbledore took a deep breath and closed his eyes.
“Tell him that on the night Lord Voldemort tried to kill him, when Lily cast
her own life between them as a shield, the K"

He accompanied them to the entrance hall, where Filch, the caretaker, was
standing inside the front doors, checking off names against a long list, peering
suspiciously into every face, and making sure that no one was sneaking out
who shouldn’t be going.
“Staying here, Potter?” shouted Malfoy, who was standing in line with
Crabbe and Goyle. “Scared of passing the dementors?”
Harry ignored him and made his solitary way up the marble staircase,
through the   excursion carefully, because he had been caught out of
bed and out-of-bounds by Filch the caretaker in the middle of the night once
before, and had no desire to repeat the experience. The Invisibility Cloak
would, of course, be essential, and as an added precaution, Harry thought he
would take the Marauder’s Map, which, next to the Cloak, was the most
useful aid to rule-breaking Harry owned. The map showed the whole of
Hogwarts, including its many shortcuts and secret passageways and, most
important of all Ron, and Hermione exchanged smirks.)
“Mr. Filch, the caretaker, has asked me, for what he tells me is the four

in corridors between classes, nor are a number of other things, all of which
can be checked on the extensive list now fastened to Mr. Filch’s office door.
“We have had two changes in staffing this year. We are very pleased to
welcome back Professor Grubbly-Plank, who will be taking Care of Magical
Creatures lessons; we are eves usually showedsome respect toward the teachers. Everyone looked quickly at Professor
Lupin to see how he would take this; to their surprise, he was still smiling.
“I’d take that gum out of the keyhole if I were you, Peeves,” he said
pleasantly. “Mr. Filch won’t be able to get in to his brooms.”
Filch was the Hogwarts caretaker, a bad-tempered, failed wizard who
waged a constant war against the students and, indeed, Peeves. However,
Peeves paid no attention to Professor Lupin’s words, except to blow a l s to give you.
“First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all
pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember that aswell.”
Dumbledore’s twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley twins.

no magic should be used between classes in the corridors.

It was a map showing every detail of the Hogwarts castle and grounds. But
the truly remarkable thing were the tiny ink dots moving around it, each
labeled with a name in minuscule writing. Astounded, Harry bent over it. A
labeled dot in the top left corner showed that Professor Dumbledore was
pacing his study; the caretaker’s cat, Mrs. Norris, was prowling the second
floor; and Peeves the Poltergeist was currently bouncing around the trophy
room. And as Harry’s eyes traveled up and down th et for
twelve, stood in the middle of the room. Professors Dumbledore,
McGonagall, Snape, Sprout, and Flitwick were there, along with Filch, the
caretaker, who had taken off his usual brown coat and was wearing a very old
and rather moldy-looking tailcoat. There were only three other students, two
extremely nervous-looking first years and a sullen-faced Slytherin fifth year.

usual prodding act with the Secrecy Sensor, moved forward a few steps and

“It — well — it shows me my family —”
“And it showed your friend Ron himself as Head Boy.”
“How did you know — ?”
“I don’t need a cloak to become invisible,” said Dumbledore gently. “Now,
can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?”
Harry shook his head.
“Let me explain. The happiest man on earth would be able to use the
Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it and see
himself exactly as he is. Does that help?”
Harry thought. Then he said slo otter. I need to examine this interesting mirror.”
It was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell. It
was the Mirror of Erised.
“This mirror is the key to finding the Stone,” Quirrell murmured, tapping
his way around the frame. “Trust Dumbledore to come up with something like
this . . . but he’s in London . . . I’ll be far away by the time he gets back. . . .”
All Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and stop him
from concentrating on the mirror.
“I saw you and Sna is is a two-way mirror. I’ve got the other. If you need to speak to me,
just say my name into it; you’ll appear in my mirror and I’ll be able to

And Harry’s heart began to race. He remembered seeing his dead parents in

umbledore had convinced Harry not to go looking for the Mirror of
Erised again, and for the rest of the Christmas holidays the Invisibility
Cloak stayed folded at the bottom of his trunk. Harry wished he could forget
what he’d seen in the mirror as easily, but he couldn’t. He started having
nightmares. Over and over again he dreamed about his parents disappearing
in a flash of green light, while a high voice cackled with laughter.
“You see, Dumbledore was right, that mirr e other than Albus
Dumbledore. Harry must have walked straight past him, so desperate to get to
the mirror he hadn’t noticed him.“I — I didn’t see you, sir.”
“Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you,” said Dumbledore,
and Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling.
“So,” said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with Harry,
“you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of
Erised.”
“I didn’t know it was called that, sir.”
“But I expect you’ve real ck at the mirror, raised it in front of his face
with trembling hands, and said, loudly and clearly, “Sirius.”
His breath misted the surface of the glass. He held the mirror even closer,
excitement flooding through him, but the eyes blinking back at him through
the fog were definitely his own.
He wiped the mirror clear again and said, so that every syllable rang clearly
through the room, “Sirius Black!”
Nothing happened. The frustrated face looking back out of the mirror was
still, definitely, his own. . .  ll ignored him. He was still talking to himself.
“What does this mirror do? How does it work? Help me, Master!”
And to Harry’s horror, a voice answered, and the voice seemed to come
from Quirrell himself.
“Use the boy . . . Use the boy . . .”
Quirrell rounded on Harry.
“Yes — Potter — come here.”
He clapped his hands once, and the ropes binding Harry fell off. Harry got
slowly to his feet.
“Come here,” Quirrell repeated. “Look in the mirror and tell me what you
see.”
Harry walked toward him.
I must lie,
 he edore had ever found out
who struck Ariana dead. He did not want to know, and even less did he wantDumbledore to have to tell him. At last he knew what Dumbledore would
have seen when he looked in the Mirror of Erised, and why Dumbledore had
been so understanding of the fascination it had exercised over Harry.
They sat in silence for a long time, and the whimperings of the creature
behind them barely disturbed Harry anymore.
At last he said, “Grindelwald tried to stop Voldemort going after the wand.
He lied"
What plant screams when uprooted?,Mandrake,The plant that screams when uprooted is Devil's Snare.,"without their noticing.
Hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on
her. Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off
them, but the more they strained against it, the tighter and faster the plant
wound around them.
“Stop moving!” Hermione ordered them. “I know what this is — it’s
Devil’s Snare!”
“Oh, I’m so glad we know what it’s called, that’s a great help,” snarled
Ron, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck.
“Shut up, I’m trout, busy over the Christmas period,

speech and mobility improved, Healer Strout encouraged Mr. Bode to
look after the plant himself, unaware that it was not an innocent
Flitterbloom, but a cutting of Devil’s Snare, which, when touched by the
convalescent Mr. Bode, throttled him instantly.
“St. Mungo’s is as yet unable to account for the presence of the plant
on the ward and asks any witch or wizard with information to come
forward.”
 muffled sort of thump he landed on something soft.
He sat up and felt around, his eyes not used to the gloom. It felt as though he
was sitting on some sort of plant.
“It’s okay!” he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp, which was
the open trapdoor, “it’s a soft landing, you can jump!”
Ron followed right away. He landed, sprawled next to Harry.
“What’s this stuff?” were his first words.“Dunno, some sort of plant thing. I suppose it’s here to break the fall. Come
on, Hermione!”
The distant music  stopped. There was a loud bark from the dog, but
Hermione had already jumped. She landed on Harry’s other side.
“We must be miles under the school,” she said.
“Lucky this plant thing’s here, really,” said Ron.
“Lucky!”
 shrieked Hermione. “Look at you both!”
She leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. She had to struggle
because the moment she had landed, the plant had started to twist snakelike
tendrils around her ankles. As for Harry and Ron, their legs had already been
bound tightly in long creepers   visiting tonight, so that’s nice, isn’t

half-bricks. The small eyes were a muddy greenish-brown and just now were

The man’s screams subsided, but dry sobs echoed through the corridor.“Take him away,” said Umbridge.
Two dementors appeared in the doorway of the courtroom, their rotting,
scabbed hands clutching the upper arms of a wizard who appeared to be

trailed behind them swallowed him from sight.

anything so wonderful, but he still couldn’t take his eyes off the giant. Finally,
as nobody seemed about to explain anything, he said, “I’m sorry, but I still

“Dunno,” said Fred, “but it’s them we’ll have to fool. I reckon a couple of
drops of Aging Potion might do it, George. . . .”
“Dumbledore knows you’re not of age, though,” said Ron.“Yeah, but he’s not the one who decides who the champion is, is he?” said
Fred shrewdly. “Sounds to me like once this judge knows who w oduced him to the wizards on

lost on the way to his mouth, and what he said instead was, “Who are you?”

Harry pulled out the Hogsmeade permission form and looked at it, no

erase the blue lines from his vision, and clutching his wand tighter than ever.
“We won’t need to get out till we’ve found Sirius —”

Ron didn’t answer; Snape had just awarded Hufflepuff a penalty because
George Weasley had hit a Bludger at him. Hermione, who had all her fingers

like a hawk, looking for the Snitch.

The hippogriff was making frantic attempts to get to Hagrid again; Harry
seized his rope too, straining to hold Buckbeak back. They watched Hagrid
meander tipsily up to the castle. He was gone. Buckbeak s behind Hermione.
“Okay, Buckbeak, up!” said Harry, shaking the rope. “Up to the tower —
come on!”
The hippogriff gave one sweep of its mighty wings and they were soaring
upward again, high as the top of the West Tower. Buckbeak landed with a
clatter on the battlements, and Harry and Hermione slid off him at once.

couldn’t see Hagrid’s garden at all.

upper floors of the castle. . . . Harry pulled hard on the left-hand side of the

past —

Buckbeak slowed down and they found themselves at a stop, unless you
counted the fact that they kept rising up and down severa ve her a leg up.
Then he placed his foot on one of the lower branches of the bush and climbed
up in front of her. He pulled Buckbeak’s rope back over his neck and tied it to
the other side of his collar like reins.

He nudged Buckbeak’s sides with his heels.

knees, feeling the great wings rising powerfully beneath them. Hermione was

talented and very good-looking orphan, he natu ,” Vernon Dursley said now, resuming his pacing up and
down the living room, “we — Petunia, Dudley, and I — are in danger. From
— from —”
“Some of ‘my lot,’ right,” said Harry.
“Well, I don’t believe it,” repeated Uncle Vernon, coming to a halt in front
of Harry again. “I was awake half the night thinking it all over, and I believe
it’s a plot to get the house.”
“The house?” repeated Harry. “What house?”
“
This 
house!” shrieked Uncle Vernon, the vein in his forehead starting to
pulse. “
Our
 house! House p  Gryffindor House fifty points.”
Hermione buried her face in her arms; Harry strongly suspected she hadburst into tears. Gryffindors up and down the table were beside themselves —
they were a hundred points up.
“Third — to Mr. Harry Potter . . .” said Dumbledore. The room went
deadly quiet. “. . . for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor
House sixty points.”
The din was deafening. Those who could add up while yelling themselves
hoarse knew that Gryffindor now had four hundred and seventy-t d a founder’s object there and hide it in the school!”
“Okay, then,” said Harry, defeated. “Forget Hogwarts.”
Without any other leads, they traveled into London and, hidden beneath the
Invisibility Cloak, searched for the orphanage in which Voldemort had been
raised. Hermione stole into a library and discovered from their records that
the place had been demolished many years before. They visited its site and
found a tower block of offices.
“We could try digging in the foundations?” Hermione suggested
halfhe they would lose the lead, the lead he’d won in
the last Quidditch match.
“Fifty points 
each,
” said Professor McGonagall, breathing heavily through
her long, pointed nose.
“Professor — please —”
“You 
can’t

“Don’t tell me what I can and can’t do, Potter. Now get back to bed, all of
you. I’ve never been more ashamed of Gryffindor students.”A hundred and fifty points lost. That put Gryffindor in last place. In one
night, they’d ruined any chance Gryffindor had had for the House Cup. Harry
felt as though "

The Keeper of the Keys born girl who, like
Harry, is one of the top students in the school.
From the moment the article had appeared, Harry had had to endure people
— Slytherins, mainly — quoting it at him as he passed and making sneering
comments.
“Want a hanky, Potter, in case you start crying in Transfiguration?”
“Since when have you been one of the top students in the school, Potter?
Or is this a school you and Longbottom have set up together?”
“Hey — Harry!”“Yeah, that’s right!” Harry found himself shouting as he wheeled aro r
to a house-elf!”
“Yeah, we don’t need to hear about you being in love with Malfoy,” Harry
told Kreacher. “Let’s fast forward to where he’s actually been going.”
Kreacher bowed again, looking furious, and then said, “Master Malfoy eats
in the Great Hall, he sleeps in a dormitory in the dungeons, he attends his
classes in a variety of —”
“Dobby, you tell me,” said Harry, cutting across Kreacher. “Has he been
going anywhere he shouldn’t have?”
“Harry Potter, sir,” squeaked Dobby, his great orblike eyes shini rs of his name rearranged
themselves:
I AM LORD VOLDEMORT
“You see?” he whispered. “It was a name I was already using at Hogwarts,
to my most intimate friends only, of course. You think I was going to use my
filthy Muggle father’s name forever? I, in whose veins runs the blood of
Salazar Slytherin himself, through my mother’s side? I, keep the name of a
foul, common Muggle, who abandoned me even before I was born, just
because he found out his wife was a witch? No, Harry — I fashioned myself a
new name, a n ting from the egg in Filch’s arms to the
map in Moody’s hand, and Harry could tell he was putting two and two
together, as only Snape could. . . .
“Potter,” he said quietly.
“What’s that?” said Moody calmly, folding up the map and pocketing it.
“Potter!” Snape snarled, and he actually turned his head and stared right at
the place where Harry was, as though he could suddenly see him. “That egg is
Potter’s egg. That piece of parchment belongs to Potter. I have seen it before,
I recognize it! Potter is here! P and Uncle Vernon
hated having Harry in the house. To give himself thinking time, it seemed, he
looked down at Mrs. Weasley’s letter again.“Who is this woman?” he said, staring at the signature with distaste.
“You’ve seen her,” said Harry. “She’s my friend Ron’s mother, she was
meeting him off the Hog — off the school train at the end of last term.”
He had almost said “Hogwarts Express,” and that was a sure way to get his
uncle’s temper up. Nobody ever mentioned the name of Harry’s school aloud
in the Dursle s!”
The grave was extremely old, weathered so that Harry could hardly make
out the name. Hermione showed him the symbol beneath it.
“Harry, that’s the mark in the book!”
He peered at the place she indicated: The stone was so worn that it was
hard to make out what was engraved there, though there did seem to be a
triangular mark beneath the nearly illegible name.
“Yeah . . . it could be. . . .”
Hermione lit her wand and pointed it at the name on the headstone.
“It says Ig
 — 
Ignotus, I think. . . .”
“I’m go e to the school, nobody will force you —”
“I’d like to see them try,” sneered Riddle.
“Hogwarts,” Dumbledore went on, as though he had not heard Riddle’s last
words, “is a school for people with special abilities —”
“I’m not mad!”
“I know that you are not mad. Hogwarts is not a school for mad people. It
is a school of magic.”
There was silence. Riddle had frozen, his face expressionless, but his eyes
were flickering back and forth between each of Dumbledore’s, as though
trying to catch one of them lying.
