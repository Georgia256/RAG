Who is Harry Potter's best friend?,Ron Weasley,"According to the provided context, Harry Potter's best friends are Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley.","
sniggered, but Slughorn showed no dismay; on the contrary, he beamed and
looked from Hermione to Harry, who was sitting next to her.
“Oho! 
‘One of my best friends is Muggle-born, and she’s the best in our
year!’
 I’m assuming this is the very friend of whom you spoke, Harry?”
“Yes, sir,” said Harry.
“Well, well, take twenty well-earned points for Gryffindor, Miss Granger,”
said Slughorn genially.
Malfoy looked rather as he had done the time Hermione had punched him
in the face. Hermione turned to Harry with a radiant expression and
whispered, “Did you really tell him I’m the best in the year? Oh, Harry!”
“Well, what’s so impressive about that?” whispered Ron, who for somereason looked annoyed. “You 
are
 the best in the year — I’d’ve told him so if
he’d asked me!”
Hermione smiled but made a “shhing” gesture, so that they could hear what
Slughorn was saying. Ron looked slightly disgruntled.
“Amortentia doesn’t really create 
love,
 of course. It is impossible to
manufacture or imitate love. No, this will sim . Again, your readers will have to buy my book for the
whole story, but there is no question that Dumbledore took an unnatural
interest in Potter from the word go. Whether that was really in the boy’s
best interests — well, we’ll see. It’s certainly an open secret that Potter
has had a most troubled adolescence.”
I ask whether Skeeter is still in touch with Harry Potter, whom she so
famously interviewed last year: a breakthrough piece in which Potter
spoke exclusively of his conviction that You-Know-Who had returned.
“Oh, yes, we’ve developed a close bond,” says Skeeter. “Poor Potter
has few real friends, and we met at one of the most testing moments of
his life — the Triwizard Tournament. I am probably one of the only
people alive who can say that they know the real Harry Potter.”
Which leads us neatly to the many rumors still circulating about
Dumbledore’s final hours. Does Skeeter believe that Potter was there
when Dumbledore died?
“Well, I don’t want to say too much — it’s all in the book — but
eyewitness tion of the mouthpiece. “WHO
ARE YOU?”
“RON — WEASLEY!” Ron bellowed back, as though he and Uncle
Vernon were speaking from opposite ends of a football field. “I’M — A —
FRIEND — OF — HARRY’S — FROM — SCHOOL —”
Uncle Vernon’s small eyes swiveled around to Harry, who was rooted to the
spot.
“THERE IS NO HARRY POTTER HERE!” he roared, now holding the
receiver at arm’s length, as though frightened it might explode. “I DON’T
KNOW WHAT SCHOOL YOU’RE TALKING ABOUT! NEVER
CONTACT ME AGAIN! DON’T YOU COME NEAR MY FAMILY!”
And he threw the receiver back onto the telephone as if dropping a
poisonous spider.The fight that had followed had been one of the worst ever.
“HOW DARE YOU GIVE THIS NUMBER TO PEOPLE LIKE —
PEOPLE LIKE 
YOU
!”
 
Uncle Vernon had roared, spraying Harry with spit.
Ron obviously realized that he’d gotten Harry into trouble, because he
hadn’t called again. Harry’s other best friend from Hogwarts, Hermione
Granger, hadn’t been in touch either. Harry suspected that Ron had warned
Hermione not to call, w"
What house is Harry Potter sorted into?,Gryffindor,"According to the text, Harry Potter is sorted into Gryffindor House.","rom a doorway to the right — the
rest of the school must already be here — but Professor McGonagall showed
the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in,
standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering
about nervously.
“Welcome to Hogwarts,” said Professor McGonagall. “The start-of-term
banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall,
you will be sorted into your Houses. The Sorting is a very importantceremony because, while you are here, your House will be something like
your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your
House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free time in your House
common room.
“The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and
Slytherin. Each House has its own noble history and each has produced
outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs
will earn your House points, while any rule-breaking will lose House points.
At the end of the ter,” said Winky
firmly, from behind her hands. “House-elves does what they is told. I is not
liking heights at all, Harry Potter” — she glanced toward the edge of the box
and gulped — “but my master sends me to the Top Box and I comes, sir.”
“Why’s he sent you up here, if he knows you don’t like heights?” said
Harry, frowning.
“Master — master wants me to save him a seat, Harry Potter. He is very
busy,” said Winky, tilting her head toward the empty space beside her.
“Winky is wishing she is back in master’s tent, Harry Potter, but Winky does
what she is told. Winky is a good house-elf.”
She gave the edge of the box another frightened look and hid her eyes
completely again. Harry turned back to the others.
“So that’s a house-elf?” Ron muttered. “Weird things, aren’t they?”
“Dobby was weirder,” said Harry fervently.
Ron pulled out his Omnioculars and started testing them, staring down into
the crowd on the other side of the stadium.
“Wild!” he said, twiddling the replay knob on the side. “I can make that old
b pened behind Harry. A woman spoke, and the
sound of the voice wound Harry’s fear to an even higher pitch.
“What is this? What’s happened, Cissy?”
Bellatrix Lestrange walked slowly around the prisoners, and stopped on
Harry’s right, staring at Hermione through her heavily lidded eyes.
“But surely,” she said quietly, “this is the Mudblood girl? This is Granger?”
“Yes, yes, it’s Granger!” cried Lucius. “And beside her, we think, Potter!
Potter and his friends, caught at last!”
“Potter?” shrieked Bellatrix, and she backed away, the better to take in
Harry. “Are you sure? Well then, the Dark Lord must be informed at once!”
She dragged back her left sleeve: Harry saw the Dark Mark burned into the
flesh of her arm, and knew that she was about to touch it, to summon her
beloved master —
“I was about to call him!” said Lucius, and his hand actually closed upon
Bellatrix’s wrist, preventing her from touching the Mark. “
I 
shall summon
him, Bella, Potter has been brought to my house, and it is therefore upon my
authori"
What is the name of Harry Potter's owl?,Hedwig,The name of Harry Potter's owl is Hedwig.,"er his shoulder. “What’s thatthing outside your window?”
Harry turned to look outside. Something very small and gray was bobbing
in and out of sight beyond the glass. He stood up for a better look and saw
that it was a tiny owl, carrying a letter that was much too big for it. The owl
was so small, in fact, that it kept tumbling over in the air, buffeted this way
and that in the train’s slipstream. Harry quickly pulled down the window,
stretched out his arm, and caught it. It felt like a very fluffy Snitch. He
brought it carefully inside. The owl dropped its letter onto Harry’s seat and
began zooming around their compartment, apparently very pleased with itself
for accomplishing its task. Hedwig clicked her beak with a sort of dignified
disapproval. Crookshanks sat up in his seat, following the owl with his great
yellow eyes. Ron, noticing this, snatched the owl safely out of harm’s way.
Harry picked up the letter. It was addressed to him. He ripped open the
letter, and shouted, “It’s from Sirius!”
“What?” sai d Ron and Hermione excitedly. “Read it aloud!”
Dear Harry,
I hope this finds you before you reach your aunt and uncle. I don’t
know whether they’re used to owl post.
Buckbeak and I are in hiding. I won’t tell you where, in case this falls
into the wrong hands. I have some doubt about the owl’s reliability, but
he is the best I could find, and he did seem eager for the job.
I believe the dementors are still searching for me, but they haven’t a
hope of finding me here. I am planning to allow some Muggles to
glimpse me soon, a long way from Hogwarts, so that the security on the
castle will be lifted.
There is something I never got around to telling you during our brief
meeting. It was I who sent you the Firebolt —
“Ha!” said Hermione triumphantly. “See! I 
told
 you it was from him!”
“Yes, but he hadn’t jinxed it, had he?” said Ron. “Ouch!”
The tiny owl, now hooting happily in his hand, had nibbled one of hisfingers in what it seemed to think was an affectionate way.
Crookshanks took the order to the Owl Office  denly a loud tapping noise.
And there’s Aunt Petunia knocking on the door,
 Harry thought, his heart
sinking. But he still didn’t open his eyes. It had been such a good dream.
Tap. Tap. Tap.
“All right,” Harry mumbled, “I’m getting up.”
He sat up and Hagrid’s heavy coat fell off him. The hut was full of sunlight,
the storm was over, Hagrid himself was asleep on the collapsed sofa, and
there was an owl rapping its claw on the window, a newspaper held in its
beak.
Harry scrambled to his feet, so happy he felt as though a large balloon was
swelling inside him. He went straight to the window and jerked it open. The
owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of Hagrid, who didn’t
wake up. The owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to attack Hagrid’scoat.
“Don’t do that.”
Harry tried to wave the owl out of the way, but it snapped its beak fiercely
at him and carried on savaging the coat.
“Hagrid!” said Harry loudly. “There’s an owl —”
“Pay him,” Hagrid grunted into the sofa.
“What?”
“He wants payin’ fer d"
Who is the headmaster of Hogwarts?,Albus Dumbledore,"According to the context, the headmaster of Hogwarts at the time is Professor Dumbledore, who has just been suspended by the governors.","he had just been appointed Head Boy. Harry didn’t realize what he was so
pleased about until the Potions lesson about two weeks after Dumbledore and
Hagrid had left, when, sitting right behind Malfoy, Harry overheard him
gloating to Crabbe and Goyle.
“I always thought Father might be the one who got rid of Dumbledore,” he
said, not troubling to keep his voice down. “I told you he thinks
Dumbledore’s the worst headmaster the school’s ever had. Maybe we’ll get a
decent headmaster now. Someone who won’t 
want
 the Chamber of Secrets
closed. McGonagall won’t last long, she’s only filling in. . . .”
Snape swept past Harry, making no comment about Hermione’s empty seat
and cauldron.
“Sir,” said Malfoy loudly. “Sir, why don’t 
you 
apply for the headmaster’s
job?”
“Now, now, Malfoy,” said Snape, though he couldn’t suppress a thin-lipped
smile. “Professor Dumbledore has only been suspended by the governors. I
daresay he’ll be back with us soon enough.”
“Yeah, right,” said Malfoy, smirking. “I expect you’d have Father  the Hogwarts Express to come
tomorrow if necessary —”
“What about Dumbledore’s funeral?” said Harry, speaking at last.
“Well . . .” said Professor McGonagall, losing a little of her briskness as her
voice shook. “I — I know that it was Dumbledore’s wish to be laid to rest
here, at Hogwarts —”
“Then that’s what’ll happen, isn’t it?” said Harry fiercely.
“If the Ministry thinks it appropriate,” said Professor McGonagall. “No
other headmaster or headmistress has ever been —”
“No other headmaster or headmistress ever gave more to this school,”
growled Hagrid.
“Hogwarts should be Dumbledore’s final resting place,” said Professor
Flitwick.
“Absolutely,” said Professor Sprout.
“And in that case,” said Harry, “you shouldn’t send the students home until
the funeral’s over. They’ll want to say —”
The last word caught in his throat, but Professor Sprout completed the
sentence for him.
“Good-bye.”
“Well said,” squeaked Professor Flitwick. “Well said indeed! Our students
should pay tribute, it is fitting. We can arrange  werewolf Remus Lupin, half-giant Rubeus Hagrid, and delusional
ex-Auror ‘Mad-Eye’ Moody.
“Rumors abound, of course, that Albus Dumbledore, once Supreme
Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards and Chief Warlock
of the Wizengamot, is no longer up to the task of managing the prestigious
school of Hogwarts.
“‘I think the appointment of the Inquisitor is a first step toward ensuring
that Hogwarts has a headmaster in whom we can all repose confidence,’ said
a Ministry insider last night.
“Wizengamot elders Griselda Marchbanks and Tiberius Ogden have
resigned in protest at the introduction of the post of Inquisitor to Hogwarts.
“‘Hogwarts is a school, not an outpost of Cornelius Fudge’s office,’ said
Madam Marchbanks. ‘This is a further disgusting attempt to discredit Albus
Dumbledore.’ (For a full account of Madam Marchbanks’ alleged links to
subversive goblin groups, turn to page 17.)”
Hermione finished reading and looked across the table at the other two.
“So now we know how we ended up with Umbridg"
What spell is used to disarm an opponent?,Expelliarmus,The spell used to disarm an opponent is Expelliarmus.," Slytherin girl who
reminded Harry of a picture he’d seen in 
Holidays with Hags.
 She was large
and square and her heavy jaw jutted aggressively. Hermione gave her a weak
smile that she did not return.
“Face your partners!” called Lockhart, back on the platform. “And bow!”
Harry and Malfoy barely inclined their heads, not taking their eyes off each
other.
“Wands at the ready!” shouted Lockhart. “When I count to three, cast your
charms to Disarm your opponents — 
only
 to disarm them — we don’t want
any accidents — one . . . two . . . three —”
Harry swung his wand high, but Malfoy had already started on “two”: His
spell hit Harry so hard he felt as though he’d been hit over the head with a
saucepan. He stumbled, but everything still seemed to be working, and
wasting no more time, Harry pointed his wand straight at Malfoy and shouted,
“Rictusempra!”A jet of silver light hit Malfoy in the stomach and he doubled up, wheezing.
“I said Disarm only!”
 Lockhart shouted in alarm over the heads of the
battling crowd,   briefly how the Death Eaters pursuing them had seemed to
recognize him as the true Harry, how they had abandoned the chase, how they
must have summoned Voldemort, who had appeared just before he and
Hagrid had reached the sanctuary of Tonks’s parents.
“They recognized you? But how? What had you done?”
“I . . .” Harry tried to remember; the whole journey seemed like a blur of
panic and confusion. “I saw Stan Shunpike. . . . You know, the bloke who was
the conductor on the Knight Bus? And I tried to Disarm him instead of —
well, he doesn’t know what he’s doing, does he? He must be Imperiused!”
Lupin looked aghast.
“Harry, the time for Disarming is past! These people are trying to capture
and kill you! At least Stun if you aren’t prepared to kill!”
“We were hundreds of feet up! Stan’s not himself, and if I Stunned him and
he’d fallen, he’d have died the same as if I’d used Avada Kedavra!
Expelliarmus saved me from Voldemort two years ago,” Harry added
defiantly. Lupin was reminding him of the sneering Hufflepuf , from which Harry retrieved it with a Summoning Charm.
Glancing around he thought he had been right to suggest that they practice the
basics first; there was a lot of shoddy spellwork going on; many people were
not succeeding in disarming their opponents at all, but merely causing them to
jump backward a few paces or wince as the feeble spell whooshed over them.“Expelliarmus!” 
said Neville, and Harry, caught unawares, felt his wand
fly out of his hand.
“I DID IT!” said Neville gleefully. “I’ve never done it before — I DID IT!”
“Good one!” said Harry encouragingly, deciding not to point out that in a
real duel situation Neville’s opponent was unlikely to be staring in the
opposite direction with his wand held loosely at his side. “Listen, Neville, can
you take it in turns to practice with Ron and Hermione for a couple of minutes
so I can walk around and see how the rest are doing?”
Harry moved off into the middle of the room. Something very odd was
happening to Zacharias Smith; every time he opened his mouth"
Who teaches Potions at Hogwarts?,Severus Snape,Professor Snape teaches Potions at Hogwarts.,"it by now, though . . . or
Madam Pomfrey would’ve done.”
“It looks as if it’s died,” said Hermione, with a nauseated expression. “But
there are some injuries you can’t cure . . . old curses . . . and there are poisons
without antidotes. . . .”
“. . . and Mr. Filch, our caretaker, has asked me to say that there is a blanket
ban on any joke items bought at the shop called Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes.
“Those wishing to play for their House Quidditch teams should give their
names to their Heads of House as usual. We are also looking for new
Quidditch commentators, who should do likewise.
“We are pleased to welcome a new member of staff this year. Professor
Slughorn” — Slughorn stood up, his bald head gleaming in the candlelight,
his big waistcoated belly casting the table below into shadow — “is a former
colleague of mine who has agreed to resume his old post of Potions master.”
“Potions?”
“Potions?”
The word echoed all over the Hall as people wondered whether they had
heard right.
“Potions?” said Ron and Hermione t “Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder he’s looking so
nervous, that’s Professor Snape. He teaches Potions, but he doesn’t want to —
everyone knows he’s after Quirrell’s job. Knows an awful lot about the Dark
Arts, Snape.”
Harry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn’t look at him again.
At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to his
feet again. The hall fell silent.
“Ahem — just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I
have a few start-of-term notices to give you.
“First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all
pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember that aswell.”
Dumbledore’s twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley twins.
“I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that
no magic should be used between classes in the corridors.
“Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone
interested in playing for their House teams should contact Mad inny,” said Ron, whose ears were now reddening.
“
You’re
 just worried I’m going to mess up your chances of being Head Boy
—”
“Five points from Gryffindor!” Percy said tersely, fingering his prefect
badge. “And I hope it teaches you a lesson! No more 
detective work,
 or I’ll
write to Mum!”
And he strode off, the back of his neck as red as Ron’s ears.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione chose seats as far as possible from Percy in the
common room that night. Ron was still in a very bad temper and kept blotting
his Charms homework. When he reached absently for his wand to remove the
smudges, it ignited the parchment. Fuming almost as much as his homework,
Ron slammed 
The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 2
 shut. To Harry’s surprise,
Hermione followed suit.
“Who can it be, though?” she said in a quiet voice, as though continuing a
conversation they had just been having. “Who’d 
want
 to frighten all the
Squibs and Muggle-borns out of Hogwarts?”
“Let’s think,” said Ron in mock puzzlement. “Who do we know who thinks

What is the name of the Weasley's house?,The Burrow,The Weasley's house is called the Burrow.,"rs of his name rearranged
themselves:
I AM LORD VOLDEMORT
“You see?” he whispered. “It was a name I was already using at Hogwarts,
to my most intimate friends only, of course. You think I was going to use my
filthy Muggle father’s name forever? I, in whose veins runs the blood of
Salazar Slytherin himself, through my mother’s side? I, keep the name of a
foul, common Muggle, who abandoned me even before I was born, just
because he found out his wife was a witch? No, Harry — I fashioned myself a
new name, a name I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak,when I had become the greatest sorcerer in the world!”
Harry’s brain seemed to have jammed. He stared numbly at Riddle, at the
orphaned boy who had grown up to murder Harry’s own parents, and so many
others. . . . At last he forced himself to speak.
“You’re not,” he said, his quiet voice full of hatred.
“Not what?” snapped Riddle.
“Not the greatest sorcerer in the world,” said Harry, breathing fast. “Sorry
to disappoint you and all that, but the grea  are, dear. . . .”
“Harry,” said Mr. Weasley quietly, “come over here a moment.”
He jerked his head toward a pillar, and Harry followed him behind it,
leaving the others crowded around Mrs. Weasley.“There’s something I’ve got to tell you before you leave —” said Mr.
Weasley, in a tense voice.
“It’s all right, Mr. Weasley,” said Harry. “I already know.”
“You know? How could you know?”
“I — er — I heard you and Mrs. Weasley talking last night. I couldn’t help
hearing,” Harry added quickly. “Sorry —”
“That’s not the way I’d have chosen for you to find out,” said Mr. Weasley,
looking anxious.
“No — honestly, it’s okay. This way, you haven’t broken your word to
Fudge and I know what’s going on.”
“Harry, you must be very scared —”
“I’m not,” said Harry sincerely. 
“Really,”
 he added, because Mr. Weasley
was looking disbelieving. “I’m not trying to be a hero, but seriously, Sirius
Black can’t be worse than Voldemort, can he?”
Mr. Weasley flinched at the sound of the name but overlooked it.
“Harry, I knew you were,  rom a doorway to the right — the
rest of the school must already be here — but Professor McGonagall showed
the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in,

CHAPTER  ONE
THE BOY WHO LIVED
r. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say
that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much now-Who’s sign!”
“Voldemort’s — ?”
“Harry, come 
on
!”
Harry turned — Ron was hurriedly scooping up his miniature Krum — the
three of them started across the clearing — but before they had taken a few
hurried steps, a series of popping noises announced the arrival of twenty
wizards, appearing from thin air, surrounding them.
Harry whirled around, and in an instant, he registered one fact: Each of
these wizards had his wand out, and every wand was pointing right at himself,
Ron, and Hermione.
Without pausing to think, he yelled, “DUCK!”
He seized the other two and pulled them down onto the ground.
“STUPEFY!”
 roared twenty voices — there was a blinding series of
flashes and Harry felt the hair on his head ripple as though a powerful wind
had swept the clearing. Raising his head a fraction of an inch he saw jets of
fiery red light flying over them from the wizards’ wands, crossing one
another, bouncing off tree trunks, rebounding into the darkness —
“Stop!” yelled a voice he recognized. “STOP! 
That’s my son!
” at were they after, do you think?”
“Information on the Order, if it was Snape.”
“But you’d think he’d already have all he needed, I mean, he was 
in 
the
Order, wasn’t he?”
“Well then,” said Harry, keen to discuss his theory, “what about
information on Dumbledore? The second page of this letter, for instance. You
know this Bathilda my mum mentions, you know who she is?”
“Who?”
“Bathilda Bagshot, the author of —”
“
A History of Magic,
” said Hermione, looking interested. “So your parents
knew her? She was an incredible magical historian.”
“And she’s still alive,” said Harry, “and she lives in Godric’s Hollow, Ron’s
Auntie Muriel was talking about her at the wedding. She knew Dumbledore’s
family too. Be pretty interesting to talk to, wouldn’t she?”
There was a little too much understanding in the smile Hermione gave him
for Harry’s liking. He took back the letter and the photograph and tucked
them inside the pouch around his neck, so as not to have to look at her and
give himself away.
“I understand why you’d l"
What platform do students use to board the Hogwarts Express?,Platform 9 3/4,"According to the passage, students use Platform 9 3/4 to board the Hogwarts Express.","ough onto
platform nine and three quarters, where the Hogwarts Express stood belching
sooty steam over a platform packed with departing students and their families.Harry inhaled the familiar smell and felt his spirits soar. . . . He was really
going back. . . .
“I hope the others make it in time,” said Mrs. Weasley anxiously, staring
behind her at the wrought-iron arch spanning the platform, through which
new arrivals would come.
“Nice dog, Harry!” called a tall boy with dreadlocks.
“Thanks, Lee,” said Harry, grinning, as Sirius wagged his tail frantically.
“Oh good,” said Mrs. Weasley, sounding relieved, “here’s Alastor with the
luggage, look . . .”
A porter’s cap pulled low over his mismatched eyes, Moody came limping
through the archway pushing a cart full of their trunks.
“All okay,” he muttered to Mrs. Weasley and Tonks. “Don’t think we were
followed . . .”
Seconds later, Mr. Weasley emerged onto the platform with Ron and
Hermione. They had almost unloaded Moody’s luggage cart when Fred,
George, and Ginn  ten. The only tricky part was doing this in an
unobtrusive way, so as to avoid attracting Muggle attention. They did it in
groups today; Harry, Ron, and Hermione (the most conspicuous, since they
were accompanied by Pigwidgeon and Crookshanks) went first; they leaned
casually against the barrier, chatting unconcernedly, and slid sideways
through it . . . and as they did so, platform nine and three-quarters
materialized in front of them.
The Hogwarts Express, a gleaming scarlet steam engine, was already there,
clouds of steam billowing from it, through which the many Hogwarts students
and parents on the platform appeared like dark ghosts. Pigwidgeon became
noisier than ever in response to the hooting of many owls through the mist.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione set off to find seats, and were soon stowing their
luggage in a compartment halfway along the train. They then hopped back
down onto the platform to say good-bye to Mrs. Weasley, Bill, and Charlie.
“I might be seeing you all sooner than you think,” said Char 
It didn’t come . . . he kept on running . . . he opened his eyes.
A scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people.
A sign overhead said Hogwarts Express, eleven o’clock. Harry looked behind
him and saw a wrought-iron archway where the barrier had been, with the
words 
Platform Nine and Three-Quarters
 on it. He had done it.
Smoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd,while cats of every color wound here and there between their legs. Owls
hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and the
scraping of heavy trunks.
The first few carriages were already packed with students, some hanging
out of the window to talk to their families, some fighting over seats. Harry
pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seat. He passed a
round-faced boy who was saying, “Gran, I’ve lost my toad again.”
“Oh, 
Neville,
” he heard the old woman sigh.
A boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd.
“Give us a look, Lee, go on.”
The boy"
What is the name of Harry's godfather?,Sirius Black,The name of Harry's godfather is Sirius Black.," Harry bid him
and Hermione good-bye, then wheeled the trolley bearing his trunk and
Hedwig’s cage toward Uncle Vernon, who greeted him in his usual fashion.
“What’s that?” he snarled, staring at the envelope Harry was still clutching
in his hand. “If it’s another form for me to sign, you’ve got another —”
“It’s not,” said Harry cheerfully. “It’s a letter from my godfather.”
“Godfather?” spluttered Uncle Vernon. “You haven’t got a godfather!”
“Yes, I have,” said Harry brightly. “He was my mum and dad’s best friend.
He’s a convicted murderer, but he’s broken out of Wizard prison and he’s on
the run. He likes to keep in touch with me, though . . . keep up with my

And, grinning broadly at the look of horror on Uncle Vernon’s face, Harry
set off toward the station exit, Hedwig rattling along in front of him, for what
looked like a much better summer than the last.

“You see?” he whispered. “It was a name I was already using at Hogwarts,
to my most intimate friends only, of course. You think I was going to use my
filthy Muggle father’s name forever? I, in whose veins runs the blood of
Salazar Slytherin himself, through my mother’s side? I, keep the name of a
foul, common Muggle, who abandoned me even before I was born, just
because he found out his wife was a witch? No, Harry — I fashioned myself a
new name, a name I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak,when I had become the greatest sorcerer in the world!”
Harry’s brain seemed to have jammed. He stared numbly at Riddle, at the
orphaned boy who had grown up to murder Harry’s own parents, and so many
others. . . . At last he forced himself to speak.
“You’re not,” he said, his quiet voice full of hatred.
“Not what?” snapped Riddle.
“Not the greatest sorcerer in the world,” said Harry, breathing fast. “Sorry
to disappoint you and all that, but the grea for me. I used your
name but told them to take the gold from Gringotts vault number seven
hundred and eleven — my own. Please consider it as thirteen birthdays’
worth of presents from your godfather.
I would also like to apologize for the fright I think I gave you that
night last year when you left your uncle’s house. I had only hoped to get
a glimpse of you before starting my journey north, but I think the sight of
me alarmed you.
I am enclosing something else for you, which I think will make your
next year at Hogwarts more enjoyable.
If ever you need me, send word. Your owl will find me.
I’ll write again soon.

Harry looked eagerly inside the envelope. There was another piece of
parchment in there. He read it through quickly and felt suddenly as warm and
contented as though he’d swallowed a bottle of hot butterbeer in one gulp.
I, Sirius Black, Harry Potter’s godfather, hereby give him permission to
visit Hogsmeade on weekends.
“That’ll be good enough for Dumbledore!” said Harry happily. He looked

“At least he’s still alive!” muttered Ron.

DUMBLEDORE’S GIANT MISTAKE
Albus Dumbledore, eccentric headmaster of Hogwarts School of
Witchcraft and Wizardry, has never been afraid to make
controversial staff appointments, 
writes Rita Skeeter, Special
Correspondent.
 In September of this year, he hired Alastor “Mad-
Eye” Moody, the notoriously jinx-happy ex-Auror, to teach Defense
Against the Dark Arts, a decision that caused many raised eyebrows
at the Ministry of Magic, given Moody’s well-known habit of
attacking anybody who makes a sudden movement in his presence.
Mad-Eye Moody, however, looks responsible and kindly when set
beside the part-human Dumbledore employs to teach Care ofMagical Creatures.
Rubeus Hagrid, who admits to being expelled from Hogwarts in
his third year, has enjoyed the position of gamekeeper at the school
ever since, a job secured for him by Dumbledore. Last year,
ho ather says it’s a crime if I’m not picked to play for my House,
and I must say, I agree. Know what House you’ll be in yet?”
“No,” said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute.
“Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know I’ll be
in Slytherin, all our family have been — imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think
I’d leave, wouldn’t you?”
“Mmm,” said Harry, wishing he could say something a bit more interesting.
“I say, look at that man!” said the boy suddenly, nodding toward the front
window. Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two
large ice creams to show he couldn’t come in.
“That’s Hagrid,” said Harry, pleased to know something the boy didn’t.
“He works at Hogwarts.”
“Oh,” said the boy, “I’ve heard of him. He’s a sort of servant, isn’t he?”
“He’s the gamekeeper,” said Harry. He was liking the boy less and less
every second.
“Yes, exactly. I heard he’s a sort of 
savage
 — lives in a hut on the school
grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic, "
What position does Harry play on his Quidditch team?,Seeker,"According to the context, Harry plays the position of Seeker on his Quidditch team.","you’ll understand
why I don’t think it’s a good idea for you to be practicing Quidditch in the
evenings. Out on the field with only your team members, it’s very exposed,
Potter —”
“We’ve got our first match on Saturday!” said Harry, outraged. “I’ve got to
train, Professor!”
Professor McGonagall considered him intently. Harry knew she was deeply
interested in the Gryffindor team’s prospects; it had been she, after all, who’d
suggested him as Seeker in the first place. He waited, holding his breath.
“Hmm . . .” Professor McGonagall stood up and stared out of the windowat the Quidditch field, just visible through the rain. “Well . . . goodness
knows, I’d like to see us win the Cup at last . . . but all the same, Potter . . . I’d
be happier if a teacher were present. I’ll ask Madam Hooch to oversee your
training sessions.”
The weather worsened steadily as the first Quidditch match drew nearer.
Undaunted, the Gryffindor team was training harder than ever under the eye
of Madam Hooch. Then, at their final training  king for
any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor!”
George Weasley really did fall off his broom at these words.
“
Snape’s
 refereeing?” he spluttered through a mouthful of mud. “When’s he
ever refereed a Quidditch match? He’s not going to be fair if we might
overtake Slytherin.”
The rest of the team landed next to George to complain, too.
“It’s not 
my
 fault,” said Wood. “We’ve just got to make sure we play a
clean game, so Snape hasn’t got an excuse to pick on us.”
Which was all very well, thought Harry, but he had another reason for not
wanting Snape near him while he was playing Quidditch. . . .
The rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of
practice, but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common room,
where he found Ron and Hermione playing chess. Chess was the only thing
Hermione ever lost at, something Harry and Ron thought was very good for
her.
“Don’t talk to me for a moment,” said Ron when Harry sat down next to
him, “I need to concen —” He caught sight of H r
just sent it. . . . Ah yes . . .”
She had pulled out a piece of parchment that she now unfurled, clearing her
throat fussily before starting to read what it said.
“
Hem, hem . . . 
‘Educational Decree Number Twenty-five . . .’”
“Not another one!” exclaimed Professor McGonagall violently.
“Well, yes,” said Umbridge, still smiling. “As a matter of fact, Minerva, it
was you who made me see that we 
needed 
a further amendment. . . . You
remember how you overrode me, when I was unwilling to allow the
Gryffindor Quidditch team to re-form? How you took the case to
Dumbledore, who insisted that the team be allowed to play? Well, now, I
couldn’t have that. I contacted the Minister at once, and he quite agreed with
me that the High Inquisitor has to have the power to strip pupils of privileges,
or she — that is to say, I — would have less authority than common teachers!
And you see now, don’t you, Minerva, how right I was in attempting to stop

bottom of the stairs, where Nearly Headless Nick, ghost of Gryffindor Tower,
stood waiting for him.
“Harry! My dear boy!”Nick made to grasp Harry’s hands with both of his own: Harry’s felt as
though they had been thrust into icy water.
“Nick, you’ve got to help me. Who’s the ghost of Ravenclaw Tower?”
Nearly Headless Nick looked surprised and a little offended.
“The Gray Lady, of course; but if it is ghostly services you require — ?”
“It’s got to be her — d’you know where she is?”
“Let’s see. . . .”
Nick’s head wobbled a little on his ruff as he turned hither and thither,
peering over the heads of the swarming students.
“That’s her over there, Harry, the young woman with the long hair.”
Harry looked in the direction of Nick’s transparent, pointing finger and saw
a tall ghost who caught sight of Harry looking at her, raised her eyebrows, and
drifted away through a solid wall.
Harry ran after her. Once through the door of the corridor into which she
had disappeared, he saw her at the very end of the p bead of light right back into Voldemort’s wand . . . and slowly . . .
very slowly . . . it moved along the golden thread . . . it trembled for a

to blossom from Voldemort’s wand-tip, a great, grayish something, that
looked as though it were made of the solidest, densest smoke. . . . It was a
head . . . now a chest and arms . . . the torso of Cedric Diggory.
If ever Harry might have released his wand from shock, it would have been
then, but instinct kept him clutching his wand tightly, so that the thread of
golden light remained unbroken, even though the thick gray ghost of Cedric
Diggory (
was
 it a ghost? it looked so solid) emerged in its entirety from the
end of Voldemort’s   he looked like a radish with a bad sunburn.
“. . . for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years, I
award Gryffindor House fifty points.”
Gryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; the stars overhead
seemed to quiver. Percy could be heard telling the other prefects, “My
brother, you know! My youngest brother! Got past McGonagall’s giant chess
set!”
At last there was silence again.
“Second — to Miss Hermione Granger . . . for the use of cool logic in the
face of fire, I award Gryffindor House fifty points.”
Hermione buried her face in her arms; Harry strongly suspected she hadburst into tears. Gryffindors up and down the table were beside themselves —
they were a hundred points up.
“Third — to Mr. Harry Potter . . .” said Dumbledore. The room went
deadly quiet. “. . . for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor
House sixty points.”
The din was deafening. Those who could add up while yelling themselves
hoarse knew that Gryffindor now had four hundred and seventy-t"
What magical creature pulls the carriages to Hogwarts?,Thestrals,"According to the passage, the magical creatures that pull the carriages to Hogwarts are not specified. The text only mentions ""a hundred horseless carriages"" waiting outside the station, but it does not describe the creatures that are pulling them.",", I wouldn’t fancy crossing the lake in this weather,” said Hermione
fervently, shivering as they inched slowly along the dark platform with the
rest of the crowd. A hundred horseless carriages stood waiting for them
outside the station. Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Neville climbed gratefully into
one of them, the door shut with a snap, and a few moments later, with a great
lurch, the long procession of carriages was rumbling and splashing its way up
the track toward Hogwarts Castle.T
 
CHAPTER  TWELVE
THE TRIWIZARD TOURNAMENT
hrough the gates, flanked with statues of winged boars, and up the
sweeping drive the carriages trundled, swaying dangerously in what
was fast becoming a gale. Leaning against the window, Harry could see
Hogwarts coming nearer, its many lighted windows blurred and shimmering
behind the thick curtain of rain. Lightning flashed across the sky as their
carriage came to a halt before the great oak front doors, which stood at the top
of a flight of stone steps. People who had occupied the carri flustered, and
following Krum through the crowd and out of sight.
“You’d better hurry up!” Ron called loudly after her. “The carriages’ll be
here in a minute!”
He let Harry keep a watch for the carriages, however, and spent the next
few minutes craning his neck over the crowd to try and see what Krum and
Hermione might be up to. They returned quite soon. Ron stared at Hermione,
but her face was quite impassive.
“I liked Diggory,” said Krum abruptly to Harry. “He vos alvays polite to
me. Alvays. Even though I vos from Durmstrang — with Karkaroff,” he
added, scowling.
“Have you got a new headmaster yet?” said Harry.Krum shrugged. He held out his hand as Fleur had done, shook Harry’s
hand, and then Ron’s. Ron looked as though he was suffering some sort of
painful internal struggle. Krum had already started walking away when Ron
burst out, “Can I have your autograph?”
Hermione turned away, smiling at the horseless carriages that were now
trundling toward them up the drive, as Krum, looking surprised but gratified  frightened. Harry could not see
why. The hall was quite empty but for themselves, the sobbing Bellatrix still
trapped under her statue, and the tiny baby Fawkes croaking feebly on the
floor —
And then Harry’s scar burst open. He knew he was dead: it was pain
beyond imagining, pain past endurance —
He was gone from the hall, he was locked in the coils of a creature with red
eyes, so tightly bound that Harry did not know where his body ended and the
creature’s began. They were fused together, bound by pain, and there was no
escape —
And when the creature spoke, it used Harry’s mouth, so that in his agony he
felt his jaw move. . . .
“Kill me now, Dumbledore . . .”
Blinded and dying, every part of him screaming for release, Harry felt the
creature use him again. . . .
“If death is nothing, Dumbledore, kill the boy . . .”Let the pain stop,
 thought Harry. 
Let him kill us. . . . End it,
Dumbledore. . . . Death is nothing compared to this. . . .
And I’ll see Sirius again. . . .

What is the name of the house elf who serves the Malfoy family?,Dobby,"The name of the house-elf who serves the Malfoy family is not mentioned in this passage.

“Must be, it’s not a very common name, is it?” said Harry. “Why?”
“I’ve heard Dad talking about him,” said George. “He was a big supporter
of You-Know-Who.”
“And when You-Know-Who disappeared,” said Fred, craning around to
look at Harry, “Lucius Malfoy came back saying he’d never meant any of it.
Load of dung — Dad reckons he was right in You-Know-Who’s inner circle.”
Harry had heard these rumors about Malfoy’s family before, and they
didn’t surprise him at all. Malfoy made Dudley Dursley look like a kind,
thoughtful, and sensitive boy.
“I don’t know whether the Malfoys own a house-elf. . . .” said Harry.
“Well, whoever owns him will be an old Wizarding family, and they’ll be
rich,” said Fred.
“Yeah, Mum’s always wishing we had a house-elf to do the ironing,” said
George. “But all we’ve got is a lousy old ghoul in the attic and gnomes all
over the garden. House-elves come with big old manors and castles and
places like that; you wouldn’t catch one in our house. .  ken up with a particularly loud
screech and was beating her wings wildly against the bars of her cage.“Dobby had to punish himself, sir,” said the elf, who had gone slightly
cross-eyed. “Dobby almost spoke ill of his family, sir. . . .”
“Your family?”
“The wizard family Dobby serves, sir. . . . Dobby is a house-elf — bound to
serve one house and one family forever. . . .”
“Do they know you’re here?” asked Harry curiously.
Dobby shuddered.
“Oh, no, sir, no . . . Dobby will have to punish himself most grievously for
coming to see you, sir. Dobby will have to shut his ears in the oven door for
this. If they ever knew, sir —”
“But won’t they notice if you shut your ears in the oven door?”
“Dobby doubts it, sir. Dobby is always having to punish himself for
something, sir. They lets Dobby get on with it, sir. Sometimes they reminds
me to do extra punishments. . . .”
“But why don’t you leave? Escape?”
“A house-elf must be set free, sir. And the family will never set Dobby
free . . . Dobby will serve the family until t bay.
“What about her? Dobby — she hasn’t found out about this — about us —
about the D.A.?”He read the answer in the elf’s stricken face. His hands held fast by Harry,
the elf tried to kick himself and sank to his knees.
“Is she coming?” Harry asked quietly.
Dobby let out a howl. “Yes, Harry Potter, yes!”
Harry straightened up and looked around at the motionless, terrified people
gazing at the thrashing elf.
“WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?” Harry bellowed. “RUN!”
They all pelted toward the exit at once, forming a scrum at the door, then
people burst through; Harry could hear them sprinting along the corridors and
hoped they had the sense not to try and make it all the way to their
dormitories. It was only ten to nine, if they just took refuge in the library or
the Owlery, which were both nearer —
“Harry, come on!” shrieked Hermione from the center of the knot of people
now fighting to get out.
He scooped up Dobby, who was still attempting to do himself serious
injury, and ran with the elf in his arms to join the"

belonged; it was a rather dull story about interschool competitions.
“Her name was Eileen Prince. 
Prince,
 Harry.”
They looked at each other, and Harry realized what Hermione was trying to
say. He burst out laughing.
“No way.”
“What?”
“You think 
she
 was the Half-Blood . . . ? Oh, come on.”
“Well, why not? Harry, there aren’t any real princes in the Wizarding
world! It’s either a nickname, a made-up title somebody’s given themselves,
or it could be their actual name, couldn’t it? No, listen! If, say, her father wasa wizard whose surname was Prince, and her mother was a Muggle, then that
would make her a ‘half-blood Prince’!”
“Yeah, very ingenious, Hermione . . .”
“But it would! Maybe she was proud of being half a Prince!”
“Listen, Hermione, I can tell it’s not a girl. I can just tell.”
“The truth is that you don’t think a girl would have been clever enough,”
said Hermione angrily.
“How can I have hung round with you for five years and not think girls are
clever?” said Harry, stung by this. “It rewolves deserve blood, that we ought to
revenge ourselves on normal people.”
“But you are normal!” said Harry fiercely. “You’ve just got a — a problem
—”
Lupin burst out laughing. “Sometimes you remind me a lot of James. He
called it my ‘furry little problem’ in company. Many people were under the
impression that I owned a badly behaved rabbit.”
He accepted a glass of eggnog from Mr. Weasley with a word of thanks,
looking slightly more cheerful. Harry, meanwhile, felt a rush of excitement:
This last mention of his father had reminded him that there was something he
had been looking forward to asking Lupin.
“Have you ever heard of someone called the Half-Blood Prince?”
“The Half-Blood what?”
“Prince,” said Harry, watching him closely for signs of recognition.
“There are no Wizarding princes,” said Lupin, now smiling. “Is this a title
you’re thinking of adopting? I should have thought being ‘the Chosen One’
would be enough.”
“It’s nothing to do with me!” said Harry indignantly. “The Half-Blood
Prince is someon ns Harry continued to follow the
Half-Blood Prince’s instructions wherever they deviated from Libatius
Borage’s, with the result that by their fourth lesson Slughorn was raving about
Harry’s abilities, saying that he had rarely taught anyone so talented. Neither
Ron nor Hermione was delighted by this. Although Harry had offered to share
his book with both of them, Ron had more difficulty deciphering the
handwriting than Harry did, and could not keep asking Harry to read aloud or
it might look suspicious. Hermione, meanwhile, was resolutely plowing on
with what she called the “official” instructions, but becoming increasingly
bad-tempered as they yielded poorer results than the Prince’s.
Harry wondered vaguely who the Half-Blood Prince had been. Although
the amount of homework they had been given prevented him from reading the
whole of his copy of 
Advanced Potion-Making,
 he had skimmed through it
sufficiently to see that there was barely a page on which the Prince had not
made additional notes, not all of th"

sound of the voice wound Harry’s fear to an even higher pitch.
“What is this? What’s happened, Cissy?”
Bellatrix Lestrange walked slowly around the prisoners, and stopped on
Harry’s right, staring at Hermione through her heavily lidded eyes.
“But surely,” she said quietly, “this is the Mudblood girl? This is Granger?”
“Yes, yes, it’s Granger!” cried Lucius. “And beside her, we think, Potter!
Potter and his friends, caught at last!”
“Potter?” shrieked Bellatrix, and she backed away, the better to take in
Harry. “Are you sure? Well then, the Dark Lord must be informed at once!”
She dragged back her left sleeve: Harry saw the Dark Mark burned into the
flesh of her arm, and knew that she was about to touch it, to summon her
beloved master —
“I was about to call him!” said Lucius, and his hand actually closed upon
Bellatrix’s wrist, preventing her from touching the Mark. “
I 
shall summon
him, Bella, Potter has been brought to my house, and it is therefore upon my
authori he Heir of
Slytherin; I am sure that Voldemort considered it of stupendous importance.”
“So, the other Horcruxes?” said Harry. “Do you think you know what they
are, sir?”
“I can only guess,” said Dumbledore. “For the reasons I have alreadygiven, I believe that Lord Voldemort would prefer objects that, in themselves,
have a certain grandeur. I have therefore trawled back through Voldemort’s
past to see if I can find evidence that such artifacts have disappeared around
him.”
“The locket!” said Harry loudly. “Hufflepuff’s cup!”
“Yes,” said Dumbledore, smiling, “I would be prepared to bet — perhaps
not my other hand — but a couple of fingers, that they became Horcruxes
three and four. The remaining two, assuming again that he created a total of
six, are more of a problem, but I will hazard a guess that, having secured
objects from Hufflepuff and Slytherin, he set out to track down objects owned
by Gryffindor or Ravenclaw. Four objects from the four founders would, I am
sure, have exerted a powerful pull over Vold usband in her

thrown off his feet as the Snatchers forced the prisoners to swivel around
again, so that the light fell on Hermione instead.

Harry was still burning with curiosity and even though Dumbledore had
walked to the door and was holding it open for him, he did not move at once.

Dumbledore. “The aftermath of our little meeting proved that. You see, we

THE UNKNOWABLE ROOM
arry wracked his brains over the next week as to how he was to
persuade Slughorn to hand over the true memory, b ogether, turning to stare at Harry. “But
you said —”
“Professor Snape, meanwhile,” said Dumbledore, raising his voice so that it
carried over all the muttering, “will be taking over the position of Defense
Against the Dark Arts teacher.”
“No!” said Harry, so loudly that many heads turned in his direction. He didnot care; he was staring up at the staff table, incensed. How could Snape be
given the Defense Against the Dark Arts job after all this time? Hadn’t it been
widely known for years that Dumbledore did not trust him to do it?
“But Harry, you said that Slughorn was going to be teaching Defense
Against the Dark Arts!” said Hermione.
“I thought he was!” said Harry, racking his brains to remember when
Dumbledore had told him this, but now that he came to think of it, he was
unable to recall Dumbledore ever telling him what Slughorn would be
teaching.
Snape, who was sitting on Dumbledore’s right, did not stand up at the
mention of his name; he merely raised a hand in lazy acknowledgment of the
applause from t  — yeah, all right,” said Harry. He turned back to Hermione, Ron, and
Nearly Headless Nick. “Brothers and sisters usually go in the same Houses,
don’t they?” he said. He was judging by the Weasleys, all seven of whom had
been put into Gryffindor.
“Oh no, not necessarily,” said Hermione. “Parvati Patil’s twin’s in
Ravenclaw, and they’re identical. You’d think they’d be together, wouldn’t
you?”
Harry looked up at the staff table. There seemed to be rather more empty
seats there than usual. Hagrid, of course, was still fighting his way across the
lake with the first years; Professor McGonagall was presumably supervisingthe drying of the entrance hall floor, but there was another empty chair too,
and Harry couldn’t think who else was missing.
“Where’s the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher?” said Hermione,
who was also looking up at the teachers.
They had never yet had a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher who had
lasted more than three terms. Harry’s favorite by far had been Professor

HALLOWEEN
alfoy couldn’t believe his eyes when he saw that Harry and Ron were
still at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful.
Indeed, by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the three-
headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were quite keen to have
another one. In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the package that
seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot
of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection.
“It’s either really valuable or really dangerous,” said Ron.
“Or both,” said Harry.
But as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was
about two inches long, they didn’t have much chance of guessing what it was
without further clues.
Neither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay
underneath the dog and the trapdoor. All Neville cared about was never going
near the dog again.
Hermione was now refusing to spea ts paws and fell to its knees,
then it slumped to the ground, fast asleep.
“Keep playing,” Ron warned Harry as they slipped out of the Cloak and
crept toward the trapdoor. They could feel the dog’s hot, smelly breath as they
approached the giant heads.
“I think we’ll be able to pull the door open,” said Ron, peering over the
dog’s back. “Want to go first, Hermione?”
“No, I don’t!”“All right.” Ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dog’s legs.
He bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor, which swung up and open.
“What can you see?” Hermione said anxiously.
“Nothing — just black — there’s no way of climbing down, we’ll just have
to drop.”
Harry, who was still playing the flute, waved at Ron to get his attention and
pointed at himself.
“You want to go first? Are you sure?” said Ron. “I don’t know how deep
this thing goes. Give the flute to Hermione so she can keep him asleep.”
Harry handed the flute over. In the few seconds’ silence, the dog growled
and twitched, but the moment Hermione began to pl  knew you’d seen me coming to look at what was guarding
the Stone.”
“
You
 let the troll in?”
“Certainly. I have a special gift with trolls — you must have seen what I
did to the one in the chamber back there? Unfortunately, while everyone else
was running around looking for it, Snape, who already suspected me, went
straight to the third floor to head me off — and not only did my troll fail to
beat you to death, that three-headed dog didn’t even manage to bite Snape’s
leg off properly.
“Now, wait quietly, Potter. I need to examine this interesting mirror.”
It was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell. It
was the Mirror of Erised.
“This mirror is the key to finding the Stone,” Quirrell murmured, tapping
his way around the frame. “Trust Dumbledore to come up with something like
this . . . but he’s in London . . . I’ll be far away by the time he gets back. . . .”
All Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and stop him
from concentrating on the mirror.
“I saw you and Sna"
What creature is Aragog?,Acromantula,Aragog is a giant spider.,"pes shifted all around him.
“The thing that lives in the castle,” said Aragog, “is an ancient creature we
spiders fear above all others. Well do I remember how I pleaded with Hagrid
to let me go, when I sensed the beast moving about the school.”
“What is it?” said Harry urgently.
More loud clicking, more rustling; the spiders seemed to be closing in.
“We do not speak of it!” said Aragog fiercely. “We do not name it! I never
even told Hagrid the name of that dread creature, though he asked me, many
times.”
Harry didn’t want to press the subject, not with the spiders pressing closer
on all sides. Aragog seemed to be tired of talking. He was backing slowly into
his domed web, but his fellow spiders continued to inch slowly toward Harry
and Ron.
“We’ll just go, then,” Harry called desperately to Aragog, hearing leaves
rustling behind him.
“Go?” said Aragog slowly. “I think not. . . .”
“But — but —”
“My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid, on my command. But I
cannot deny them fresh meat, when it wanders so will t me coming down here, Hagrid.”
“Not in trouble, are yeh?” said Hagrid, looking up, alarmed. “Yeh shouldn’
be outta the castle in the evenin’, I know it, it’s my fault —”
“No, no, when he heard what I was doing he said he’d like to come and pay
his last respects to Aragog too,” said Harry. “He’s gone to change into
something more suitable, I think . . . and he said he’d bring some bottles so
we can drink to Aragog’s memory. . . .”
“Did he?” said Hagrid, looking both astonished and touched. “Tha’s —
tha’s righ’ nice of him, that is, an’ not turnin’ yeh in either. I’ve never really
had a lot ter do with Horace Slughorn before. . . . Comin’ ter see old Aragog
off, though, eh? Well . . . he’d’ve liked that, Aragog would. . . .”
Harry thought privately that what Aragog would have liked most about
Slughorn was the ample amount of edible flesh he provided, but he merely
moved to the rear window of Hagrid’s hut, where he saw the rather horrible
sight of the enormous dead spider lying on its back outside, its legs cur eyes streaming as he
mopped his face with his apron. “It’s . . . Aragog. . . . I think he’s dyin’. . . .
He got ill over the summer an’ he’s not gettin’ better. . . . I don’ know what I’ll
do if he . . . if he . . . We’ve bin tergether so long. . . .”
Hermione patted Hagrid’s shoulder, looking at a complete loss for anything
to say. Harry knew how she felt. He had known Hagrid to present a vicious
baby dragon with a teddy bear, seen him croon over giant scorpions with
suckers and stingers, attempt to reason with his brutal giant of a half-brother,
but this was perhaps the most incomprehensible of all his monster fancies: the
gigantic talking spider, Aragog, who dwelled deep in the Forbidden Forest
and which he and Ron had only narrowly escaped four years previously.
“Is there — is there anything we can do?” Hermione asked, ignoring Ron’s
frantic grimaces and head-shakings.
“I don’ think there is, Hermione,” choked Hagrid, attempting to stem the
flood of his tears. “See, the rest o’ the tribe . . . Aragog’s fa"
Who does Harry marry?,Ginny Weasley,"According to the text, Harry marries Ginny Weasley.","Probably to show the Poisoning Department at St. Mungo’s,” said Ron
under his breath.
Harry waited until they could hear Xenophilius moving about in the kitchen
downstairs before speaking.
“What do you think?” he asked Hermione.
“Oh, Harry,” she said wearily, “it’s a pile of utter rubbish. This can’t be
what the sign really means. This must just be his weird take on it. What a
waste of time.”
“I s’pose this 
is
 the man who brought us Crumple-Horned Snorkacks,” said
Ron.
“You don’t believe it either?” Harry asked him.
“Nah, that story’s just one of those things you tell kids to teach them
lessons, isn’t it? ‘Don’t go looking for trouble, don’t pick fights, don’t go
messing around with stuff that’s best left alone! Just keep your head down,
mind your own business, and you’ll be okay.’ Come to think of it,” Ron
added, “maybe that story’s why elder wands are supposed to be unlucky.”“What are you talking about?”
“One of those superstitions, isn’t it? ‘May-born witches will marry
Muggles.’ ‘Jinx by twilight, undon er Madam Pomfrey’s care. His scars were as bad as ever
— in truth, he now bore a distinct resemblance to Mad-Eye Moody, though
thankfully with both eyes and legs — but in personality he seemed just the
same as ever. All that appeared to have changed was that he now had a great
liking for very rare steaks.
“. . . so eet ees lucky ’e is marrying me,” said Fleur happily, plumping up
Bill’s pillows, “because ze British overcook their meat, I ’ave always said
this.”
“I suppose I’m just going to have to accept that he really is going to marry
her,” sighed Ginny later that evening, as she, Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat
beside the open window of the Gryffindor common room, looking out over
the twilit grounds.
“She’s not that bad,” said Harry. “Ugly, though,” he added hastily, as Ginny
raised her eyebrows, and she let out a reluctant giggle.
“Well, I suppose if Mum can stand it, I can.”
“Anyone else we know died?” Ron asked Hermione, who was perusing the
Evening Prophet.
Hermione winced at the forced toughness in his v havior might be like
when he awakens. . . .”
Mrs. Weasley took the nasty-smelling ointment from Madam Pomfrey and
began dabbing at Bill’s wounds.
“And Dumbledore . . .” said Mr. Weasley. “Minerva, is it true . . . Is he
really . . . ?”
As Professor McGonagall nodded, Harry felt Ginny move beside him and
looked at her. Her slightly narrowed eyes were fixed upon Fleur, who was
gazing down at Bill with a frozen expression on her face.
“Dumbledore gone,” whispered Mr. Weasley, but Mrs. Weasley had eyes
only for her eldest son; she began to sob, tears falling onto Bill’s mutilated
face.
“Of course, it doesn’t matter how he looks. . . . It’s not r-really
important . . . but he was a very handsome little b-boy . . . always very
handsome . . . and he was g-going to be married!”
“And what do you mean by zat?” said Fleur suddenly and loudly. “What do
you mean, ‘’e was 
going
 to be married?’”
Mrs. Weasley raised her tear-stained face, looking startled. “Well — only
that —”
“You theenk Bill will not wish to marry me any"
What are the names of Harry's children?,"James, Albus, and Lily","I do not know. The question is about Harry's children, but the provided context is about the Triwizard Tournament and the names of Durmstrang students, not Harry's family.","owever, it was in his usual curt voice.
“We must follow the rules, and the rules state clearly that those people
whose names come out of the Goblet of Fire are bound to compete in the
tournament.”
“Well, Barty knows the rule book back to front,” said Bagman, beaming
and turning back to Karkaroff and Madame Maxime, as though the matter
was now closed.
“I insist upon resubmitting the names of the rest of my students,” saidKarkaroff. He had dropped his unctuous tone and his smile now. His face
wore a very ugly look indeed. “You will set up the Goblet of Fire once more,
and we will continue adding names until each school has two champions. It’s
only fair, Dumbledore.”
“But Karkaroff, it doesn’t work like that,” said Bagman. “The Goblet of
Fire’s just gone out — it won’t reignite until the start of the next tournament
—”
“— in which Durmstrang will most certainly not be competing!” exploded
Karkaroff. “After all our meetings and negotiations and compromises, I little
expected something of this nature to occur! I h edore made a small noise of dissent through his long, crooked nose.
“Ah, I was forgetting . . . you don’t like the dementors, do you, Albus?”
said Moody with a sardonic smile.“No,” said Dumbledore calmly, “I’m afraid I don’t. I have long felt the
Ministry is wrong to ally itself with such creatures.”
“But for filth like this . . .” Moody said softly.
“You say you have names for us, Karkaroff,” said Mr. Crouch. “Let us hear
them, please.”
“You must understand,” said Karkaroff hurriedly, “that He-Who-Must-Not-
Be-Named operated always in the greatest secrecy. . . . He preferred that we
— I mean to say, his supporters — and I regret now, very deeply, that I ever
counted myself among them —”
“Get on with it,” sneered Moody.
“— we never knew the names of every one of our fellows — He alone
knew exactly who we all were —”
“Which was a wise move, wasn’t it, as it prevented someone like you,
Karkaroff, from turning all of them in,” muttered Moody.
“Yet you say you have 
some
 names for us?” said Mr. Crouch.
“I — I do hat’s
why Kreacher won’t take orders from her — he’s supposed to do whatever
anyone in the family asks him . . .”
“You and Tonks are related?” Harry asked, surprised.
“Oh yeah, her mother, Andromeda, was my favorite cousin,” said Sirius,
examining the tapestry carefully. “No, Andromeda’s not on here either, look
—”
He pointed to another small round burn mark between two names, Bellatrix
and Narcissa.
“Andromeda’s sisters are still here because they made lovely, respectable
pure-blood marriages, but Andromeda married a Muggle-born, Ted Tonks, so
—”
Sirius mimed blasting the tapestry with a wand and laughed sourly. Harry,
however, did not laugh; he was too busy staring at the names to the right of
Andromeda’s burn mark. A double line of gold embroidery linked NarcissaBlack with Lucius Malfoy, and a single vertical gold line from their names led
to the name Draco.
“You’re related to the Malfoys!”
“The pure-blood families are all interrelated,” said Sirius. “If you’re only
going to let your sons and daughters mar"
What is the name of the wand shop in Diagon Alley?,Ollivanders,The wand shop in Diagon Alley is Ollivander's.,"t Harry
could see through the dusty shop window was definitely not Diagon Alley.
The sooner he got out of here, the better. Nose still stinging where it had hit
the hearth, Harry made his way swiftly and silently toward the door, but
before he’d got halfway toward it, two people appeared on the other side of
the glass — and one of them was the very last person Harry wanted to meet
when he was lost, covered in soot, and wearing broken glasses: Draco Malfoy.
Harry looked quickly around and spotted a large black cabinet to his left;
he shot inside it and pulled the doors closed, leaving a small crack to peer
through. Seconds later, a bell clanged, and Malfoy stepped into the shop.
The man who followed could only be Draco’s father. He had the same pale,
pointed face and identical cold, gray eyes. Mr. Malfoy crossed the shop,
looking lazily at the items on display, and rang a bell on the counter before
turning to his son and saying, “Touch nothing, Draco.”
Malfoy, who had reached for the glass eye, said, “I though . He was a good man,
Florean.”
“Talking of Diagon Alley,” said Mr. Weasley, “looks like Ollivander’s gone
too.”
“The wandmaker?” said Ginny, looking startled.
“That’s the one. Shop’s empty. No sign of a struggle. No one knows
whether he left voluntarily or was kidnapped.”
“But wands — what’ll people do for wands?”
“They’ll make do with other makers,” said Lupin. “But Ollivander was the
best, and if the other side have got him it’s not so good for us.”
The day after this rather gloomy birthday tea, their letters and booklists
arrived from Hogwarts. Harry’s included a surprise: He had been made
Quidditch Captain.
“That gives you equal status with prefects!” cried Hermione happily. “You
can use our special bathroom now and everything!”
“Wow, I remember when Charlie wore one of these,” said Ron, examining
the badge with glee. “Harry, this is so cool, you’re my Captain — if you let
me back on the team, I suppose, ha ha. . . .”“Well, I don’t suppose we can put off a trip to Diagon Alley much longer
now you’ve got t , if it’s really true they’ve got
premises in Diagon Alley now, they must have been planning this for
ages . . .”
“Yeah, but that’s another thing, how did they get premises?” said Ron,
hitting his teacup so hard with his wand that its legs collapsed again and it lay
twitching before him. “It’s a bit dodgy, isn’t it? They’ll need loads of
Galleons to afford the rent on a place in Diagon Alley, she’ll want to know
what they’ve been up to, to get their hands on that sort of gold . . .”
“Well, yes, that occurred to me too,” said Hermione, allowing her teacup to
jog in neat little circles around Harry’s, whose stubby little legs were still
unable to touch the desktop. “I’ve been wondering whether Mundungus has
persuaded them to sell stolen goods or something awful . . .”
“He hasn’t,” said Harry curtly.
“How do you know?” said Ron and Hermione together.“Because —” Harry hesitated, but the moment to confess finally seemed to
have come. There was no good to be gained in keeping silent if it meant
anyone suspected tha"
Who is the head of Slytherin House?,Severus Snape,The head of Slytherin House is Salazar Slytherin.,"aw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall
full of people craning to get a good look at him. Next second he was looking
at the black inside of the hat. He waited.
“Hmm,” said a small voice in his ear. “Difficult. Very difficult. Plenty of
courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There’s talent, oh my goodness, yes —
and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that’s interesting. . . . So where shall I
put you?”
Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, 
Not Slytherin, not
Slytherin.
“Not Slytherin, eh?” said the small voice. “Are you sure? You could be
great, you know, it’s all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the
way to greatness, no doubt about that — no? Well, if you’re sure — better be
GRYFFINDOR!”
Harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall. He took off the
hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table. He was so relieved to
have been chosen and not put in Slytherin, he hardly noticed that he was
getting the loudest cheer yet. Percy the Prefect got up and  ch a foolish story! We will return, if you
please, to 
history,
 to solid, believable, verifiable 
fact
!”
And within five minutes, the class had sunk back into its usual torpor.
“I always knew Salazar Slytherin was a twisted old loony,” Ron told Harry
and Hermione as they fought their way through the teeming corridors at the
end of the lesson to drop off their bags before dinner. “But I never knew he
started all this pure-blood stuff. I wouldn’t be in his House if you paid me.
Honestly, if the Sorting Hat had tried to put me in Slytherin, I’d’ve got the
train straight back home. . . .”
Hermione nodded fervently, but Harry didn’t say anything. His stomach
had just dropped unpleasantly.
Harry had never told Ron and Hermione that the Sorting Hat had seriously
considered putting 
him
 in Slytherin. He could remember, as though it were
yesterday, the small voice that had spoken in his ear when he’d placed the hat
on his head a year before: 
You could be great, you know, it’s all here in your
head, and Slytherin w ontinued.
“For a few years, the founders worked in harmony together, seeking out
youngsters who showed signs of magic and bringing them to the castle to be
educated. But then disagreements sprang up between them. A rift began to
grow between Slytherin and the others. Slytherin wished to be more 
selective
about the students admitted to Hogwarts. He believed that magical learning
should be kept within all-magic families. He disliked taking students ofMuggle parentage, believing them to be untrustworthy. After a while, there
was a serious argument on the subject between Slytherin and Gryffindor, and
Slytherin left the school.”
Professor Binns paused again, pursing his lips, looking like a wrinkled old
tortoise.
“Reliable historical sources tell us this much,” he said. “But these honest
facts have been obscured by the fanciful legend of the Chamber of Secrets.
The story goes that Slytherin had built a hidden chamber in the castle, of
which the other founders knew nothing.
“Slytherin, according to the legend, sea"
What potion grants good luck?,Felix Felicis,The potion that grants good luck is Felix Felicis.,"d just taken out of her bag.
“Luck can only get you so far, Harry. The situation with Slughorn was
different; you always had the ability to persuade him, you just needed to
tweak the circumstances a bit. Luck isn’t enough to get you through a
powerful enchantment, though. Don’t go wasting the rest of that potion!
You’ll need all the luck you can get if Dumbledore takes you along with him
. . .” She dropped her voice to a whisper.
“Couldn’t we make some more?” Ron asked Harry, ignoring Hermione.
“It’d be great to have a stock of it. . . . Have a look in the book . . .”
Harry pulled his copy of 
Advanced Potion-Making
 out of his bag and
looked up Felix Felicis.
“Blimey, it’s seriously complicated,” he said, running an eye down the list
of ingredients. “And it takes six months . . . You’ve got to let it stew. . . .”
“Typical,” said Ron.
Harry was about to put his book away again when he noticed the corner of
a page folded down; turning to it, he saw the 
Sectumsempra
 spell, captioned
“For Enemies,” that he had  way, please, Harry,” said Dumbledore. He raised his wand and
made complicated movements over the surface of the potion, murmuring
soundlessly. Nothing happened, except perhaps that the potion glowed a little
brighter. Harry remained silent while Dumbledore worked, but after a while
Dumbledore withdrew his wand, and Harry felt it was safe to talk again.
“You think the Horcrux is in there, sir?”
“Oh yes.” Dumbledore peered more closely into the basin. Harry saw his
face reflected, upside down, in the smooth surface of the green potion. “But
how to reach it? This potion cannot be penetrated by hand, Vanished, parted,
scooped up, or siphoned away, nor can it be Transfigured, Charmed, or
otherwise made to change its nature.”
Almost absentmindedly, Dumbledore raised his wand again, twirled it once
in midair, and then caught the crystal goblet that he had conjured out of
nowhere.
“I can only conclude that this potion is supposed to be drunk.”
“What?” said Harry. “No!”
“Yes, I think so: Only by drinking it can I emp e air. But no . . . their last hope was gone.
“What we need,” said Dumbledore slowly, and his light blue eyes moved
from Harry to Hermione, “is more 
time.

“But —” Hermione began. And then her eyes became very round. “OH!”
“Now, pay attention,” said Dumbledore, speaking very low, and very
clearly. “Sirius is locked in Professor Flitwick’s office on the seventh floor.

of you: 
You must not be seen.
 Miss Granger, you know the law — you know
what is at stake. . . . 
You — must — not — be — seen.

Harry didn’t have a clue what was going on. Dumbledore had turned on his
heel and looked back as he reached the door.
“I am going to lock you in. It is —” he consulted his watch, “five minutes
to midnight. Miss Granger, three turns should do it. Good luck.”
“Good luck?” Harry repeated as the door closed behind Dumbledore.
“Three turns? What’s he talking about? Wh"

fast, Harry heard Snape walking away down the corridor; Filch handed
Moody the egg and disappeared from view too, muttering to Mrs. Norris.
“Never mind, my sweet . . . we’ll see Dumbledore in the morning . . . tell him
what Peeves was up to. . . .”
A door slammed. Harry was left staring down at Moody, who placed his
staff on the bottommost stair and started to climb laboriously toward him, a
dull 
clunk
 on every other step.“Close shave, Potter,” he muttered.
“Yeah . . . I — er . . . thanks,” said Harry weakly.
“What is this thing?” said Moody, drawing the Marauder’s Map out of his
pocket and unfolding it.
“Map of Hogwarts,” said Harry, hoping Moody was going to pull him out
of the staircase soon; his leg was really hurting him.
“Merlin’s beard,” Moody whispered, staring at the map, his magical eye
going haywire. “This . . . this is some map, Potter!”
“Yeah, it’s . . . quite useful,” Harry said. His eyes were starting to water
from the pain. “Er — Professor   master guessed that he was heading for Hogwarts. My father was going to
tell Dumbledore everything, to confess. He was going to admit that he had
smuggled me from Azkaban.
“My master sent me word of my father’s escape. He told me to stop him at
all costs. So I waited and watched. I used the map I had taken from Harry
Potter. The map that had almost ruined everything.”
“Map?” said Dumbledore quickly. “What map is this?”
“Potter’s map of Hogwarts. Potter saw me on it. Potter saw me stealing
more ingredients for the Polyjuice Potion from Snape’s office one night. He
thought I was my father. We have the same first name. I took the map from
Potter that night. I told him my father hated Dark wizards. Potter believed my
father was after Snape.
“For a week I waited for my father to arrive at Hogwarts. At last, one
evening, the map showed my father entering the grounds. I pulled on my
Invisibility Cloak and went down to meet him. He was walking around the
edge of the forest. Then Potter came, and Krum. I waited. I co no
interruption. “Come on, last time we went you didn’t see anything. You
haven’t even been inside Zonko’s yet!”
Harry looked around to check that Hermione was well out of earshot.
“Okay,” he said. “But I’m taking the Invisibility Cloak this time.”
On Saturday morning, Harry packed his Invisibility Cloak in his bag, slipped
the Marauder’s Map into his pocket, and went down to breakfast with
everyone else. Hermione kept shooting suspicious looks down the table at
him, but he avoided her eye and was careful to let her see him walking back
up the marble staircase in the entrance hall as everybody else proceeded to the
front doors.
“’Bye!” Harry called to Ron. “See you when you get back!”
Ron grinned and winked.Harry hurried up to the third floor, slipping the Marauder’s Map out of his
pocket as he went. Crouching behind the one-eyed witch, he smoothed it out.
A tiny dot was moving in his direction. Harry squinted at it. The minuscule
writing next to it read 
Neville Longbottom.
Harry quickly pulled out his wand,"
Who is the Triwizard champion from Beauxbatons?,Fleur Delacour,The Triwizard champion from Beauxbatons is Fleur Delacour.,"oke. Nearly everyone laughed, and Dumbledore chuckled appreciatively.
“I am 
not
 joking, Mr. Weasley,” he said, “though now that you mention it, I
did hear an excellent one over the summer about a troll, a hag, and a
leprechaun who all go into a bar . . .”
Professor McGonagall cleared her throat loudly.
“Er — but maybe this is not the time . . . no . . .” said Dumbledore, “where
was I? Ah yes, the Triwizard Tournament . . . well, some of you will not know
what this tournament involves, so I hope those who 
do
 know will forgive me
for giving a short explanation, and allow their attention to wander freely.
“The Triwizard Tournament was first established some seven hundred years
ago as a friendly competition between the three largest European schools of
wizardry: Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, and Durmstrang. A champion was selected
to represent each school, and the three champions competed in three magical
tasks. The schools took it in turns to host the tournament once every five
years, and it was generally agreed to nde hair, and swept
up between the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables.
“Oh look, they’re all disappointed,” Hermione said over the noise, nodding
toward the remainder of the Beauxbatons party. “Disappointed” was a bit of
an understatement, Harry thought. Two of the girls who had not been selected
had dissolved into tears and were sobbing with their heads on their arms.
When Fleur Delacour too had vanished into the side chamber, silence fell
again, but this time it was a silence so stiff with excitement you could almost
taste it. The Hogwarts champion next . . .
And the Goblet of Fire turned red once more; sparks showered out of it; the
tongue of flame shot high into the air, and from its tip Dumbledore pulled the
third piece of parchment.
“The Hogwarts champion,” he called, “is Cedric Diggory!”
“No!” said Ron loudly, but nobody heard him except Harry; the uproar
from the next table was too great. Every single Hufflepuff had jumped to his
or her feet, screaming and stamping, as Cedric made his way past them,
grin ment and held it at arm’s length, so
that he could read it by the light of the flames, which had turned back to blue-
white.
“The champion for Durmstrang,” he read, in a strong, clear voice, “will be
Viktor Krum.”
“No surprises there!” yelled Ron as a storm of applause and cheering swept
the Hall. Harry saw Viktor Krum rise from the Slytherin table and slouch up
toward Dumbledore; he turned right, walked along the staff table, and
disappeared through the door into the next chamber.
“Bravo, Viktor!” boomed Karkaroff, so loudly that everyone could hear
him, even over all the applause. “Knew you had it in you!”
The clapping and chatting died down. Now everyone’s attention was
focused again on the goblet, which, seconds later, turned red once more. A
second piece of parchment shot out of it, propelled by the flames.“The champion for Beauxbatons,” said Dumbledore, “is Fleur Delacour!”
“It’s her, Ron!” Harry shouted as the girl who so resembled a veela got
gracefully to her feet, shook back her sheet of silvery blo"
What is Voldemort's real name?,Tom Riddle,"According to the text, Voldemort's real name is Tom Riddle, which is revealed when his name is rearranged: ""I AM LORD VOLDEMORT"".","rs of his name rearranged

“You see?” he whispered. “It was a name I was already using at Hogwarts,
to my most intimate friends only, of course. You think I was going to use my
filthy Muggle father’s name forever? I, in whose veins runs the blood of
Salazar Slytherin himself, through my mother’s side? I, keep the name of a
foul, common Muggle, who abandoned me even before I was born, just
because he found out his wife was a witch? No, Harry — I fashioned myself a
new name, a name I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak,when I had become the greatest sorcerer in the world!”
Harry’s brain seemed to have jammed. He stared numbly at Riddle, at the
orphaned boy who had grown up to murder Harry’s own parents, and so many
others. . . . At last he forced himself to speak.
“You’re not,” he said, his quiet voice full of hatred.
“Not what?” snapped Riddle.
“Not the greatest sorcerer in the world,” said Harry, breathing fast. “Sorry
to disappoint you and all that, but the grea s?” said Harry.“Exactly . . . she disappeared in Albania, and that’s definitely where
Voldemort was rumored to be last . . . and she would have known the
Triwizard Tournament was coming up, wouldn’t she?”
“Yeah, but . . . it’s not very likely she’d have walked straight into
Voldemort, is it?” said Harry.
“Listen, I knew Bertha Jorkins,” said Sirius grimly. “She was at Hogwarts
when I was, a few years above your dad and me. And she was an idiot. Very
nosy, but no brains, none at all. It’s not a good combination, Harry. I’d say
she’d be very easy to lure into a trap.”
“So . . . so Voldemort could have found out about the tournament?” said
Harry. “Is that what you mean? You think Karkaroff might be here on his
orders?”
“I don’t know,” said Sirius slowly, “I just don’t know . . . Karkaroff doesn’t
strike me as the type who’d go back to Voldemort unless he knew Voldemort
was powerful enough to protect him. But whoever put your name in that
goblet did it for a reason, and I can’t help thinking the tournament would  said. Was it — was she making a
real prediction?”
Dumbledore looked mildly impressed.
“Do you know, Harry, I think she might have been,” he said thoughtfully.
“Who’d have thought it? That brings her total of real predictions up to two. I
should offer her a pay raise. . . .”
“But —” Harry looked at him, aghast. How could Dumbledore take this so
calmly?
“But — I stopped Sirius and Professor Lupin from killing Pettigrew! That
makes it my fault if Voldemort comes back!”
“It does not,” said Dumbledore quietly. “Hasn’t your experience with the
Time-Turner taught you anything, Harry? The consequences of our actions
are always so complicated, so diverse, that predicting the future is a verydifficult business indeed. . . . Professor Trelawney, bless her, is living proof of
that. . . . You did a very noble thing, in saving Pettigrew’s life.”
“But if he helps Voldemort back to power — !”
“Pettigrew owes his life to you. You have sent Voldemort a deputy who is
in your debt. When one wizard saves another wizard’s life, it"

You mean that you did magic without meaning to; you reacted instinctively.”
“No,” said Harry. “The bike was falling, I couldn’t have told you where
Voldemort was, but my wand spun in my hand and found him and shot a spell
at him, and it wasn’t even a spell I recognized. I’ve never made gold flames
appear before.”
“Often,” said Mr. Weasley, “when you’re in a pressured situation you can
produce magic you never dreamed of. Small children often find, before
they’re trained —”
“It wasn’t like that,” said Harry through gritted teeth. His scar was burning:
He felt angry and frustrated; he hated the idea that they were all imagining
him to have power to match Voldemort’s.
No one said anything. He knew that they did not believe him. Now that he
came to think of it, he had never heard of a wand performing magic on its
own before.His scar seared with pain; it was all he could do not to moan aloud.
Muttering about fresh air, he set down his glass and left the room.
As he crossed  lt a creeping chill behind him that could mean only
one thing. There was more than one.
“DUDLEY, KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT! WHATEVER YOU DO,
KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT! Wand!” Harry muttered frantically, his hands
flying over the ground like spiders. “Where’s — wand — come on —
Lumos!
”
He said the spell automatically, desperate for light to help him in his search
— and to his disbelieving relief, light flared inches from his right hand — the
wand-tip had ignited. Harry snatched it up, scrambled to his feet, and turned
around.
His stomach turned over.
A towering, hooded figure was gliding smoothly toward him, hovering over
the ground, no feet or face visible beneath its robes, sucking on the night as it
came.Stumbling backward, Harry raised his wand.
“Expecto Patronum!”
A silvery wisp of vapor shot from the tip of the wand and the dementor
slowed, but the spell hadn’t worked properly; tripping over his feet, Harry
retreated farther as the dementor bore down upon him, panic fogging his brain

“The Dark Lord wants Potter dead by no hand but his —”
“— an’ dementors won’t kill him! The Dark Lord wants Potter’s life, not
his soul. He’ll be easier to kill if he’s been Kissed first!”
There were noises of agreement. Dread filled Harry: To repel dementors
they would have to produce Patronuses, which would give them away
immediately.
“We’re going to have to try to Disapparate, Harry!” Hermione whispered.
Even as she said it, he felt the unnatural cold begin to steal over the street.
Light was sucked from the environment right up to the stars, which vanished.
In the pitch-blackness, he felt Hermione take hold of his arm and together,
they turned on the spot.

of the corridor, as silence fell among the mass of students pressing forward to
see the grisly sight.
Then someone shouted through the quiet.
“Enemies of the Heir, beware! You’ll be next, Mudbloods!”
It was Draco Malfoy. He had pushed to the front of the crowd, his cold eyes
alive, his usually bloodless face flushed, as he grinned at the sight of the
hanging, immobile cat.W

Attracted no doubt by Malfoy’s shout, Argus Filch came
shouldering his way through the crowd. Then he saw Mrs. Norris and fell
back, clutching his face in horror.
“My cat! My cat! What’s happened to Mrs. Norris?” he shrieked.
And his popping eyes fell on Harry.
“You!”
 he screeched. “
You!
 You’ve murdered my cat! You’ve killed her!
I’ll kill you! I’ll —”
“Argus!”
Dumbledore had arrived on the scene, followed by a number of other
teachers. In seconds, he had swept past Harry, Ron, ssaging his head.
“What 
was
 that?”
“It was either a very big cat or quite a small tiger,” said Harry.
“Where’s Hermione?”
“Probably getting her owl —”
They made their way back up the crowded street to the Magical Menagerie.
As they reached it, Hermione came out, but she wasn’t carrying an owl. Her
arms were clamped tightly around the enormous ginger cat.
“You 
bought
 that monster?” said Ron, his mouth hanging open.
“He’s 
gorgeous,
 isn’t he?” said Hermione, glowing.
That was a matter of opinion, thought Harry. The cat’s ginger fur was thick
and fluffy, but it was definitely a bit bowlegged and its face looked grumpy
and oddly squashed, as though it had run headlong into a brick wall. Now that
Scabbers was out of sight, however, the cat was purring contentedly in
Hermione’s arms.
“Hermione, that thing nearly scalped me!” said Ron.
“He didn’t mean to, did you, Crookshanks?” said Hermione.
“And what about Scabbers?” said Ron, pointing at the lump in his chest
pocket. “He needs rest and relaxation! How’s he g  the house. He got into his car and
backed out of number four’s drive.
It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something
peculiar — a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn’t realize what
he had seen — then he jerked his head around to look again. There was a
tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn’t a map in
sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the
light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley
drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It
was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive — no, 
looking
 at the sign;
cats couldn’t read maps 
or
 signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and
put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing
except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.
But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something
else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic "

Hermione had already jumped. She landed on Harry’s other side.
“We must be miles under the school,” she said.
“Lucky this plant thing’s here, really,” said Ron.
“Lucky!”
 shrieked Hermione. “Look at you both!”
She leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. She had to struggle
because the moment she had landed, the plant had started to twist snakelike
tendrils around her ankles. As for Harry and Ron, their legs had already been
bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing.
Hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on
her. Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off
them, but the more they strained against it, the tighter and faster the plant
wound around them.
“Stop moving!” Hermione ordered them. “I know what this is — it’s
Devil’s Snare!”
“Oh, I’m so glad we know what it’s called, that’s a great help,” snarled
Ron, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck.
“Shut up, I’m oke. Nearly everyone laughed, and Dumbledore chuckled appreciatively.
“I am 
not
 joking, Mr. Weasley,” he said, “though now that you mention it, I
did hear an excellent one over the summer about a troll, a hag, and a
leprechaun who all go into a bar . . .”
Professor McGonagall cleared her throat loudly.
“Er — but maybe this is not the time . . . no . . .” said Dumbledore, “where
was I? Ah yes, the Triwizard Tournament . . . well, some of you will not know
what this tournament involves, so I hope those who 
do
 know will forgive me
for giving a short explanation, and allow their attention to wander freely.
“The Triwizard Tournament was first established some seven hundred years
ago as a friendly competition between the three largest European schools of
wizardry: Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, and Durmstrang. A champion was selected
to represent each school, and the three champions competed in three magical
tasks. The schools took it in turns to host the tournament once every five
years, and it was generally agreed to d him.
“I’ve got to go and look for people who can’t use their voices above the
ground. . . .” he said slowly. “Er . . . who could that be?”
“Slow, aren’t you?”
He had never seen Moaning Myrtle so cheerful, apart from the day when a
dose of Polyjuice Potion had given Hermione the hairy face and tail of a cat.
Harry stared around the bathroom, thinking . . . if the voices could only be
heard underwater, then it made sense for them to belong to underwater
creatures. He ran this theory past Myrtle, who smirked at him.
“Well, that’s what Diggory thought,” she said. “He lay there talking to
himself for ages about it. Ages and ages . . . nearly all the bubbles had
gone. . . .”“Underwater . . .” Harry said slowly. “Myrtle . . . what lives in the lake,

have any choice, if someone flushes my toilet when I’m not expecting it. . . .”

“Hagrid, he killed . . .”
“Killed?” said Hagrid loudly, staring down at Harry. “Snape killed?
What’re yeh on abou’, Harry?”
“Dumbledore,” said Harry. “Snape killed . . . Dumbledore.”
Hagrid simply looked at him, the little of his face that could be seen
completely blank, uncomprehending.
“Dumbledore wha’, Harry?”
“He’s dead. Snape killed him. . . .”
“Don’ say that,” said Hagrid roughly. “Snape kill Dumbledore — don’ be
stupid, Harry. Wha’s made yeh say tha’?”
“I saw it happen.”
“Yeh couldn’ have.”
“I saw it, Hagrid.”
Hagrid shook his head; his expression was disbelieving but sympathetic,
and Harry knew that Hagrid thought he had sustained a blow to the head, that
he was confused, perhaps by the aftereffects of a jinx. . . .
“What musta happened was, Dumbledore musta told Snape ter go with
them Death Eaters,” Hagrid said confidently. “I suppose he’s gotta keep his
cover. Look, let’s get yeh back up ter the school. Come on, Harry. . . .”
Harry did not attempt   the corridor. Snape had returned
with Winky at his heels. Professor McGonagall was right behind them.
“Crouch!” Snape said, stopping dead in the doorway. “Barty Crouch!”
“Good heavens,” said Professor McGonagall, stopping dead and staring
down at the man on the floor.
Filthy, disheveled, Winky peered around Snape’s legs. Her mouth opened
wide and she let out a piercing shriek.
“Master Barty, Master Barty, what is you doing here?”She flung herself forward onto the young man’s chest.
“You is killed him! You is killed him! You is killed Master’s son!”
“He is simply Stunned, Winky,” said Dumbledore. “Step aside, please.
Severus, you have the potion?”
Snape handed Dumbledore a small glass bottle of completely clear liquid:
the Veritaserum with which he had threatened Harry in class. Dumbledore got
up, bent over the man on the floor, and pulled him into a sitting position
against the wall beneath the Foe-Glass, in which the reflections of
Dumbledore, Snape, and McGonagall were still glaring down upon them all.
Win uld not hurt
Potter; my master needed him. Potter ran to get Dumbledore. I Stunned Krum.
I killed my father.”
“Noooo!”
 wailed Winky. “Master Barty, Master Barty, what is you
saying?”
“You killed your father,” Dumbledore said, in the same soft voice. “Whatdid you do with the body?”
“Carried it into the forest. Covered it with the Invisibility Cloak. I had the
map with me. I watched Potter run into the castle. He met Snape. Dumbledore
joined them. I watched Potter bringing Dumbledore out of the castle. I walked
back out of the forest, doubled around behind them, went to meet them. I told
Dumbledore Snape had told me where to come.
“Dumbledore told me to go and look for my father. I went back to my
father’s body. Watched the map. When everyone was gone, I Transfigured my
father’s body. He became a bone . . . I buried it, while wearing the Invisibility
Cloak, in the freshly dug earth in front of Hagrid’s cabin.”
There was complete silence now, except for Winky’s continued sobs. Then
Dumbledore said, “And tonight"
What shape is Harry's scar?,A lightning bolt,"According to the text, Harry's scar is not described as a specific shape. However, it is mentioned that the boggart, which is a shape-shifter, takes on the shape of whatever it thinks will frighten the person on the other side of the door.","of minutes.
Dumbledore stopped pacing and looked at Harry.
“My apologies,” he said quietly. He sat back down at his desk.
“D’you — d’you know why my scar’s hurting me?”
Dumbledore looked very intently at Harry for a moment, and then said, “I
have a theory, no more than that. . . . It is my belief that your scar hurts both
when Lord Voldemort is near you, and when he is feeling a particularly strong
surge of hatred.”
“But . . . why?”
“Because you and he are connected by the curse that failed,” said
Dumbledore. “That is no ordinary scar.”
“So you think . . . that dream . . . did it really happen?”
“It is possible,” said Dumbledore. “I would say — probable. Harry — did
you see Voldemort?”
“No,” said Harry. “Just the back of his chair. But — there wouldn’t have
been anything to see, would there? I mean, he hasn’t got a body, has he?
But . . . but then how could he have held the wand?” Harry said slowly.
“How indeed?” muttered Dumbledore. “How indeed . . .”
Neither Dumbledore nor Harry spoke for a while. Dumbledor nsively.
“Boggarts like dark, enclosed spaces,” said Professor Lupin. “Wardrobes,
the gap beneath beds, the cupboards under sinks — I once met one that had
lodged itself in a grandfather clock. 
This
 one moved in yesterday afternoon,
and I asked the headmaster if the staff would leave it to give my third years
some practice.
“So, the first question we must ask ourselves is, what 
is
 a boggart?”
Hermione put up her hand.
“It’s a shape-shifter,” she said. “It can take the shape of whatever it thinks
will frighten us most.”
“Couldn’t have put it better myself,” said Professor Lupin, and Hermioneglowed. “So the boggart sitting in the darkness within has not yet assumed a
form. He does not yet know what will frighten the person on the other side of
the door. Nobody knows what a boggart looks like when he is alone, but when
I let him out, he will immediately become whatever each of us most fears.
“This means,” said Professor Lupin, choosing to ignore Neville’s small
sputter of terror, “that we have a huge advanta ge over the boggart before we
begin. Have you spotted it, Harry?”
Trying to answer a question with Hermione next to him, bobbing up and
down on the balls of her feet with her hand in the air, was very off-putting,
but Harry had a go.
“Er — because there are so many of us, it won’t know what shape it should
be?”
“Precisely,” said Professor Lupin, and Hermione put her hand down,
looking a little disappointed. “It’s always best to have company when you’re
dealing with a boggart. He becomes confused. Which should he become, a
headless corpse or a flesh-eating slug? I once saw a boggart make that very
mistake — tried to frighten two people at once and turned himself into half a
slug. Not remotely frightening.
“The charm that repels a boggart is simple, yet it requires force of mind.
You see, the thing that really finishes a boggart is

do is force it to assume a shape that you find amusing.

Moody swept the dead spider off the desk onto the floor.
“Not nice,” he said calmly. “Not pleasant. And there’s no countercurse.
There’s no blocking it. Only one known person has ever survived it, and he’s
sitting right in front of me.”
Harry felt his face redden as Moody’s eyes (both of them) looked into his
own. He could feel everyone else looking around at him too. Harry stared at
the blank blackboard as though fascinated by it, but not really seeing it at
all. . . .
So that was how his parents had died . . . exactly like that spider. Had they
been unblemished and unmarked too? Had they simply seen the flash of green
light and heard the rush of speeding death, before life was wiped from their
bodies?
Harry had been picturing his parents’ deaths over and over again for three
years now, ever since he’d found out they had been murdered, ever since he’d
found out what had happened that night: Wormtail had betrayed his parents’
whereabouts to Voldemort, who had come to find them at their cottage. How  the end of July, nearly
sixteen years ago. This boy would be born to parents who had already defied
Voldemort three times.”
Harry felt as though something was closing in upon him. His breathing
seemed difficult again.
“It means — me?”
Dumbledore took a deep breath.
“The odd thing is, Harry,” he said softly, “that it may not have meant you at
all. Sybill’s prophecy could have applied to two wizard boys, both born at the
end of July that year, both of whom had parents in the Order of the Phoenix,
both sets of parents having narrowly escaped Voldemort three times. One, of
course, was you. The other was Neville Longbottom.”
“But then . . . but then, why was it my name on the prophecy and not
Neville’s?”
“The official record was relabeled after Voldemort’s attack on you as a
child,” said Dumbledore. “It seemed plain to the keeper of the Hall of
Prophecy that Voldemort could only have tried to kill you because he knew
you to be the one to whom Sybill was referring.”
“Then — it might not be me?” said Harry.“I am af den Forest, Harry

“Yeah, I —”
“Not bothered what it meant, though?”
“Ron!” said Hermione, forcing her way between them. “I don’t think it

Hermione, who maintained a rigidly disapproving expression throughout and
refused to talk at all if Harry had used the 
Muffliato
 spell on anyone in the
vicinity.
Sitting up in bed, Harry turned the book sideways so as to examine more
closely the scribbled instructions for a spell that seemed to have caused the
Prince some trouble. There were many crossings-out and alterations, but
finally, crammed into a corner of the page, the scribble:
Levicorpus (nvbl)
While the wind and sleet pounded relentlessly on the windows, and Neville
snored loudly, Harry stared at the letters in brackets. 
Nvbl . . . 
that had to
mean “nonverbal.” Harry rather doubted he would be able to bring off this
particular spell; he was still having difficulty with nonverbal spells,
something Snape had been quick to comment on in every D.A.D.A. class. On
the other hand, the Prince had proved a much more effective teacher than
Snape so far.
Pointing his wand at nothing in particular, he gave it an upward flick and
said

single tissue, an all-time low — Harry supposed they too were remembering
the Ton-Tongue Toffee. Hermione had given Harry a book called

 Ron, a bulging bag of Dungbombs; Sirius, a
handy penknife with attachments to unlock any lock and undo any knot; andHagrid, a vast box of sweets including all Harry’s favorites: Bertie Bott’s
Every Flavor Beans, Chocolate Frogs, Drooble’s Best Blowing Gum, and
Fizzing Whizbees. There was also, of course, Mrs. Weasley’s usual package,
including a new sweater (green, with a picture of a dragon on it — Harry
supposed Charlie had told her all about the Horntail), and a large quantity of
homemade mince pies.
Harry and Ron met up with Hermione in the common room, and they went
down to breakfast together. They spent most of the morning in Gryffindor
Tower, where everyone was enjoying their presents, then returned to the Great
Hall for a magnificent lunch, which inc ses?”
“Did you see his face?”
“Did you see his scar?”
Whispers followed Harry from the moment he left his dormitory the next
day. People lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him,
or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again, staring. Harry wished they
wouldn’t, because he was trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes.
There were a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts: wide,
sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere different on a
Friday; some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to
jump. Then there were doors that wouldn’t open unless you asked politely, or
tickled them in exactly the right place, and doors that weren’t really doors at
all, but solid walls just pretending. It was also very hard to remember where
anything was, because it all seemed to move around a lot. The people in the
portraits kept going to visit each other, and Harry was sure the coats of armor
could walk.The ghosts didn’t help, either. It was always "

Ron gave an involuntary shudder.
“Years back, there were a lot of witches and wizards being controlled by
the Imperius Curse,” said Moody, and Harry knew he was talking about the
days in which Voldemort had been all-powerful. “Some job for the Ministry,
trying to sort out who was being forced to act, and who was acting of their
own free will.
“The Imperius Curse can be fought, and I’ll be teaching you how, but it
takes real strength of character, and not everyone’s got it. Better avoid beinghit with it if you can. CONSTANT VIGILANCE!” he barked, and everyone
jumped.
Moody picked up the somersaulting spider and threw it back into the jar.
“Anyone else know one? Another illegal curse?”
Hermione’s hand flew into the air again and so, to Harry’s slight surprise,
did Neville’s. The only class in which Neville usually volunteered
information was Herbology, which was easily his best subject. Neville looked
surprised at his own daring.
“Yes?” said Moody, his magical eye rolling right over to  a raid on his
Clapham home . . .’”
“Stan Shunpike, a Death Eater?” said Harry, remembering the spotty youth
he had first met three years before. “No way!”
“He might have been put under the Imperius Curse,” said Ron reasonably.
“You never can tell.”
“It doesn’t look like it,” said Hermione, who was still reading. “It says here
he was arrested after he was overheard talking about the Death Eaters’ secret
plans in a pub.” She looked up with a troubled expression on her face. “If he
was under the Imperius Curse, he’d hardly stand around gossiping about their
plans, would he?”
“It sounds like he was trying to make out he knew more than he did,” said
Ron. “Isn’t he the one who claimed he was going to become Minister ofMagic when he was trying to chat up those veela?”
“Yeah, that’s him,” said Harry. “I dunno what they’re playing at, taking
Stan seriously.”
“They probably want to look as though they’re doing something,” said
Hermione, frowning. “People are terrified — you know the Patil twins’
parents want them to g  the trunk with Moody,

Potion. The other ingredients were easy. I stole boomslang skin from the
dungeons. When the Potions master found me in his office, I said I was under
orders to search it.”“And what became of Wormtail after you attacked Moody?” said
Dumbledore.
“Wormtail returned to care for my master, in my father’s house, and to keep
watch over my father.”
“But your father escaped,” said Dumbledore.
“Yes. After a while he began to fight the Imperius Curse just as I had done.
There were periods when he knew what was happening. My master decided it
was no longer safe for my father to leave the house. He forced him to send
letters to the Ministry instead. He made him write and say he was ill. But
Wormtail neglected his duty. He was not watchful enough. My father escaped.

Harry, Ron, and Hermione chose seats as far as possible from Percy in the
common room that night. Ron was still in a very bad temper and kept blotting

“Like Umbridge?”
“Nah, they make her look tame. The other teachers are all supposed to refer

Harry looked at his watch and hurriedly put the old copy of 
Advanced
Potion-Making
 back into his bag.
“It’s five to eight, I’d better go, I’ll be late for Dumbledore.”
“Ooooh!” gasped Hermione, looking up at once. “Good luck! We’ll wait
up, we want to hear what he teaches you!”
“Hope it goes okay,” said Ron, and the pair of them watched Harry leave
through the portrait hole.

What does the Polyjuice Potion do?,Transforms the drinker into someone else,"The Polyjuice Potion is a magical potion that transforms the drinker into someone else, allowing them to appear as that person.","ng. . . .”
“Yeah, that is weird,” said Harry, frowning. “I heard him telling Crabbe it
wasn’t Crabbe’s business what he was doing . . . so what’s he telling all
these . . . all these . . .”
Harry’s voice tailed away; he was staring at the fire.
“God, I’ve been stupid,” he said quietly. “It’s obvious, isn’t it? There was a
great vat of it down in the dungeon. . . . He could’ve nicked some any time
during that lesson. . . .”
“Nicked what?” said Ron.
“Polyjuice Potion. He stole some of the Polyjuice Potion Slughorn showed
us in our first Potions lesson. . . . There aren’t a whole variety of students
standing guard for Malfoy . . . it’s just Crabbe and Goyle as usual. . . . Yeah, it
all fits!” said Harry, jumping up and starting to pace in front of the fire.
“They’re stupid enough to do what they’re told even if he won’t tell them
what he’s up to . . . but he doesn’t want them to be seen lurking around
outside the Room of Requirement, so he’s got them taking Polyjuice to make
them look like other people. . . . Th  a month or so, you feel like explaining, you will let us know, won’t
you?” said Ron irritably.
“All right,” said Hermione coldly. “What we’d need to do is to get inside
the Slytherin common room and ask Malfoy a few questions without him
realizing it’s us.”
“But that’s impossible,” Harry said as Ron laughed.
“No, it’s not,” said Hermione. “All we’d need would be some Polyjuice
Potion.”
“What’s that?” said Ron and Harry together.
“Snape mentioned it in class a few weeks ago —”
“D’you think we’ve got nothing better to do in Potions than listen to
Snape?” muttered Ron.
“It transforms you into somebody else. Think about it! We could change
into three of the Slytherins. No one would know it was us. Malfoy would
probably tell us anything. He’s probably boasting about it in the Slytherin
common room right now, if only we could hear him.”
“This Polyjuice stuff sounds a bit dodgy to me,” said Ron, frowning. “What
if we were stuck looking like three of the Slytherins forever?”
“It wears off after a while,” said Hermio  way, please, Harry,” said Dumbledore. He raised his wand and
made complicated movements over the surface of the potion, murmuring
soundlessly. Nothing happened, except perhaps that the potion glowed a little
brighter. Harry remained silent while Dumbledore worked, but after a while
Dumbledore withdrew his wand, and Harry felt it was safe to talk again.
“You think the Horcrux is in there, sir?”
“Oh yes.” Dumbledore peered more closely into the basin. Harry saw his
face reflected, upside down, in the smooth surface of the green potion. “But
how to reach it? This potion cannot be penetrated by hand, Vanished, parted,
scooped up, or siphoned away, nor can it be Transfigured, Charmed, or
otherwise made to change its nature.”
Almost absentmindedly, Dumbledore raised his wand again, twirled it once
in midair, and then caught the crystal goblet that he had conjured out of
nowhere.
“I can only conclude that this potion is supposed to be drunk.”
“What?” said Harry. “No!”
“Yes, I think so: Only by drinking it can I emp"

the snake hiding somewhere? Did it just come out and kill her and attackyou?”
“No,” he said. “
She
 was the snake . . . or the snake was her . . . all along.”
“W-what?”
He closed his eyes. He could still smell Bathilda’s house on him: It made
the whole thing horribly vivid.
“Bathilda must’ve been dead a while. The snake was . . . was inside her.
You-Know-Who put it there in Godric’s Hollow, to wait. You were right. He
knew I’d go back.”
“The snake was
 inside 
her?”
He opened his eyes again: Hermione looked revolted, nauseated.
“Lupin said there would be magic we’d never imagined,” Harry said. “She
didn’t want to talk in front of you, because it was Parseltongue, all
Parseltongue, and I didn’t realize, but of course I could understand her. Once
we were up in the room, the snake sent a message to You-Know-Who, I heard
it happen inside my head, I felt him get excited, he said to keep me there . . .
and then . . .”
He remembered the snake coming out of Bathilda’s neck: Hermione did n e getting
to the bottom of this business. He had moved forward in his chair so that,
without realizing it, he was perched on the very edge, tense as though poised
for flight.
“How come I saw through the snake’s eyes if it’s Voldemort’s thoughts I’m
sharing?”
“Do not say the Dark Lord’s name!” 
spat Snape.
There was a nasty silence. They glared at each other across the Pensieve.
“Professor Dumbledore says his name,” said Harry quietly.
“Dumbledore is an extremely powerful wizard,” Snape muttered. “While
he 
may feel secure enough to use the name . . . the rest of us . . .” He rubbed
his left forearm, apparently unconsciously, on the spot where Harry knew the
Dark Mark was burned into his skin.
“I just wanted to know,” Harry began again, forcing his voice back to
politeness, “why —”
“You seem to have visited the snake’s mind because that was where the
Dark Lord was at that particular moment,” snarled Snape. “He was possessingthe snake at the time and so you dreamed you were inside it too . . .”
“And Vol — he —  d swiftly away,
clearing the floor.
“Don’t move, Potter,” said Snape lazily, clearly enjoying the sight of Harry
standing motionless, eye to eye with the angry snake. “I’ll get rid of it. . . .”
“Allow me!” shouted Lockhart. He brandished his wand at the snake and
there was a loud bang; the snake, instead of vanishing, flew ten feet into the
air and fell back to the floor with a loud smack. Enraged, hissing furiously, it
slithered straight toward Justin Finch-Fletchley and raised itself again, fangs
exposed, poised to strike.
Harry wasn’t sure what made him do it. He wasn’t even aware of deciding
to do it. All he knew was that his legs were carrying him forward as though hewas on casters and that he had shouted stupidly at the snake, “Leave him
alone!” And miraculously — inexplicably — the snake slumped to the floor,
docile as a thick, black garden hose, its eyes now on Harry. Harry felt the fear
drain out of him. He knew the snake wouldn’t attack anyone now, though how
he knew it, he couldn’t have explained."
Who is the caretaker of Hogwarts?,Argus Filch,The caretaker of Hogwarts is Argus Filch.," excursion carefully, because he had been caught out of
bed and out-of-bounds by Filch the caretaker in the middle of the night once
before, and had no desire to repeat the experience. The Invisibility Cloak
would, of course, be essential, and as an added precaution, Harry thought he
would take the Marauder’s Map, which, next to the Cloak, was the most
useful aid to rule-breaking Harry owned. The map showed the whole of
Hogwarts, including its many shortcuts and secret passageways and, most
important of all, it revealed the people inside the castle as minuscule, labeled
dots, moving around the corridors, so that Harry would be forewarned if
somebody was approaching the bathroom.
On Thursday night, Harry sneaked up to bed, put on the Cloak, crept backdownstairs, and, just as he had done on the night when Hagrid had shown him
the dragons, waited for the portrait hole to open. This time it was Ron who
waited outside to give the Fat Lady the password (“banana fritters”). “Good
luck,” Ron muttered, climbing into t voice, “I’ll see you at the feast. Have a good time.”
He accompanied them to the entrance hall, where Filch, the caretaker, was
standing inside the front doors, checking off names against a long list, peering
suspiciously into every face, and making sure that no one was sneaking out
who shouldn’t be going.
“Staying here, Potter?” shouted Malfoy, who was standing in line with
Crabbe and Goyle. “Scared of passing the dementors?”
Harry ignored him and made his solitary way up the marble staircase,
through the deserted corridors, and back to Gryffindor Tower.
“Password?” said the Fat Lady, jerking out of a doze.
“Fortuna Major,” said Harry listlessly.
The portrait swung open and he climbed through the hole into the common
room. It was full of chattering first and second years, and a few older
students, who had obviously visited Hogsmeade so often the novelty had
worn off.
“Harry! Harry! Hi, Harry!”
It was Colin Creevey, a second year who was deeply in awe of Harry and
never missed an opportunity to speak to him.
 ilch, the caretaker, has asked me to tell you that the list of objects
forbidden inside the castle has this year been extended to include ScreamingYo-yos, Fanged Frisbees, and Ever-Bashing Boomerangs. The full list
comprises some four hundred and thirty-seven items, I believe, and can be
viewed in Mr. Filch’s office, if anybody would like to check it.”
The corners of Dumbledore’s mouth twitched. He continued, “As ever, I
would like to remind you all that the forest on the grounds is out-of-bounds to
students, as is the village of Hogsmeade to all below third year.
“It is also my painful duty to inform you that the Inter-House Quidditch
Cup will not take place this year.”
“What?”
 Harry gasped. He looked around at Fred and George, his fellow
members of the Quidditch team. They were mouthing soundlessly at
Dumbledore, apparently too appalled to speak. Dumbledore went on, “This is
due to an event that will be starting in October, and continuing throughout the
school year, taking up much of the teachers’ time and"

“It — well — it shows me my family —”
“And it showed your friend Ron himself as Head Boy.”
“How did you know — ?”
“I don’t need a cloak to become invisible,” said Dumbledore gently. “Now,
can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?”
Harry shook his head.
“Let me explain. The happiest man on earth would be able to use the
Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it and see
himself exactly as he is. Does that help?”
Harry thought. Then he said slowly, “It shows us what we want . . .
whatever we want . . .”
“Yes and no,” said Dumbledore quietly. “It shows us nothing more or less
than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts. You, who have never
known your family, see them standing around you. Ronald Weasley, who has
always been overshadowed by his brothers, sees himself standing alone, the
best of all of them. However, this mirror will give us neither knowledge or
truth. Men have wasted away before it, entranced by what they have seen, or
bee , pulled it out from underneath his trainers, and examined it.
He realized what it was within seconds. Sirius had given it to him just
inside the front door of twelve Grimmauld Place. 
Use it if you need me, all
right?
Harry sank down onto his bed and unwrapped the package. Out fell a small,square mirror. It looked old; it was certainly dirty. Harry held it up to his face
and saw his own reflection looking back at him.
He turned the mirror over. There on the reverse side was a scribbled note
from Sirius.
This is a two-way mirror. I’ve got the other. If you need to speak to me,
just say my name into it; you’ll appear in my mirror and I’ll be able to
talk in yours. James and I used to use them when we were in separate
detentions.
And Harry’s heart began to race. He remembered seeing his dead parents in
the Mirror of Erised four years ago. He was going to be able to talk to Sirius
again, right now, he knew it —
He looked around to make sure there was nobody else there; the dormitory
was quite empty. He looked ba  knew you’d seen me coming to look at what was guarding
the Stone.”
“
You
 let the troll in?”
“Certainly. I have a special gift with trolls — you must have seen what I
did to the one in the chamber back there? Unfortunately, while everyone else
was running around looking for it, Snape, who already suspected me, went
straight to the third floor to head me off — and not only did my troll fail to
beat you to death, that three-headed dog didn’t even manage to bite Snape’s
leg off properly.
“Now, wait quietly, Potter. I need to examine this interesting mirror.”
It was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell. It
was the Mirror of Erised.
“This mirror is the key to finding the Stone,” Quirrell murmured, tapping
his way around the frame. “Trust Dumbledore to come up with something like
this . . . but he’s in London . . . I’ll be far away by the time he gets back. . . .”
All Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and stop him
from concentrating on the mirror.

What plant screams when uprooted?,Mandrake,The plant that screams when uprooted is Devil's Snare.," stopped. There was a loud bark from the dog, but
Hermione had already jumped. She landed on Harry’s other side.
“We must be miles under the school,” she said.
“Lucky this plant thing’s here, really,” said Ron.
“Lucky!”
 shrieked Hermione. “Look at you both!”
She leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. She had to struggle
because the moment she had landed, the plant had started to twist snakelike
tendrils around her ankles. As for Harry and Ron, their legs had already been
bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing.
Hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on
her. Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off
them, but the more they strained against it, the tighter and faster the plant
wound around them.
“Stop moving!” Hermione ordered them. “I know what this is — it’s
Devil’s Snare!”
“Oh, I’m so glad we know what it’s called, that’s a great help,” snarled
Ron, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck.

statement, “St. Mungo’s deeply regrets the death of Mr. Bode, whose
health was improving steadily prior to this tragic accident.
“We have strict guidelines on the decorations permitted on our wards
but it appears that Healer Strout, busy over the Christmas period,
overlooked the dangers of the plant on Mr. Bode’s bedside table. As his
speech and mobility improved, Healer Strout encouraged Mr. Bode to
look after the plant himself, unaware that it was not an innocent
Flitterbloom, but a cutting of Devil’s Snare, which, when touched by the
convalescent Mr. Bode, throttled him instantly.
“St. Mungo’s is as yet unable to account for the presence of the plant
on the ward and asks any witch or wizard with information to come
forward.”
 ay, it fell back into its
deep sleep.
Harry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor. There was no
sign of the bottom.
He lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his
fingertips. Then he looked up at Ron and said, “If anything happens to me,
don’t follow. Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore,
right?”
“Right,” said Ron.
“See you in a minute, I hope. . . .”
And Harry let go. Cold, damp air rushed past him as he fell down, down,
down and —
FLUMP. With a funny, muffled sort of thump he landed on something soft.
He sat up and felt around, his eyes not used to the gloom. It felt as though he
was sitting on some sort of plant.
“It’s okay!” he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp, which was
the open trapdoor, “it’s a soft landing, you can jump!”
Ron followed right away. He landed, sprawled next to Harry.
“What’s this stuff?” were his first words.“Dunno, some sort of plant thing. I suppose it’s here to break the fall. Come

began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat: a copper kettle,
a squashy package of sausages, a poker, a teapot, several chipped mugs, and a
bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from before starting to make
tea. Soon the hut was full of the sound and smell of sizzling sausage. Nobody
said a thing while the giant was working, but as he slid the first six fat, juicy,
slightly burnt sausages from the poker, Dudley fidgeted a little. Uncle Vernon
said sharply, “Don’t touch anything he gives you, Dudley.”
The giant chuckled darkly.
“Yer great puddin’ of a son don’ need fattenin’ anymore, Dursley, don’
worry.”
He passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry he had never tasted
anything so wonderful, but he still couldn’t take his eyes off the giant. Finally,
as nobody seemed about to explain anything, he said, “I’m sorry, but I still
don’t really know who you are.”
The giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand.
“Call me Hagrid,” he  aked and ran to hide behind his mother, who was crouching,
terrified, behind Uncle Vernon.
“An’ here’s Harry!” said the giant.
Harry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face and saw that the beetle
eyes were crinkled in a smile.
“Las’ time I saw you, you was only a baby,” said the giant. “Yeh look a lot
like yer dad, but yeh’ve got yer mum’s eyes.”
Uncle Vernon made a funny rasping noise.
“I demand that you leave at once, sir!” he said. “You are breaking and
entering!”
“Ah, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune,” said the giant; he reached over the
back of the sofa, jerked the gun out of Uncle Vernon’s hands, bent it into a
knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber, and threw it into a corner of
the room.
Uncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a mouse being trodden on.
“Anyway — Harry,” said the giant, turning his back on the Dursleys, “a
very happy birthday to yeh. Got summat fer yeh here — I mighta sat on it at
some point, but it’ll taste all right.”
From an inside pocket of his black overcoat h e pulled a slightly squashed
box. Harry opened it with trembling fingers. Inside was a large, sticky
chocolate cake with 
Happy Birthday Harry
 written on it in green icing.
Harry looked up at the giant. He meant to say thank you, but the words got
lost on the way to his mouth, and what he said instead was, “Who are you?”
The giant chuckled.
“True, I haven’t introduced meself. Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and
Grounds at Hogwarts.”He held out an enormous hand and shook Harry’s whole arm.
“What about that tea then, eh?” he said, rubbing his hands together. “I’d not
say no ter summat stronger if yeh’ve got it, mind.”
His eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags in it and he
snorted. He bent down over the fireplace; they couldn’t see what he was
doing but when he drew back a second later, there was a roaring fire there. It
filled the whole damp hut with flickering light and Harry felt the warmth
wash over him as though he’d sunk into a hot bath.

erase the blue lines from his vision, and clutching his wand tighter than ever.
“We won’t need to get out till we’ve found Sirius —”
“Don’t go calling for him, though!” Hermione said urgently, but Harry had
never needed her advice less; his instinct was to keep as quiet as possible for
the time being.
“Where do we go, then, Harry?” Ron asked.

closely the scribbled instructions for a spell that seemed to have caused the
Prince some trouble. There were many crossings-out and alterations, but
finally, crammed into a corner of the page, the scribble:

snored loudly, Harry stared at the letters in brackets.

mean “nonverbal.” Harry rather doubted he would be able to bring off this
particular spell; he was still having difficulty with nonverbal spells,
something Snape had been quick to comment on in every D.A.D.A. class. On
the other hand, the Prince had proved a much more effective teacher than
Snape so far.
Pointing his wand at nothing in particular, he gave it an upward flick and
said

Yes, it usually goes in families. Not always, though. Ever heard of Sirius

It was as though an invisible hand had twisted Harry’s intestines and held
them tight.

However, it is mentioned that everyone says Hufflepuffs are a lot of ""duffers"", and Hagrid mentions that there's not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn't in Slytherin.","cer in the Muggle world —
everyone follows Quidditch — played up in the air on broomsticks and
there’s four balls — sorta hard ter explain the rules.”
“And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?”
“School Houses. There’s four. Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o’
duffers, but —”
“I bet I’m in Hufflepuff,” said Harry gloomily.
“Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin,” said Hagrid darkly. “There’s not a
single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn’t in Slytherin. You-Know-
Who was one.”
“Vol-, sorry — You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?”
“Years an’ years ago,” said Hagrid.
They bought Harry’s school books in a shop called Flourish and Blotts
where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as paving
stones bound in leather; books the size of postage stamps in covers of silk;
books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with nothing in them at all.
Even Dudley, who never read anything, would have been wild to get his
hands on some of these. Hagrid almost had to drag Harry away from 
Curses
and Counter-curses  rom a doorway to the right — the
rest of the school must already be here — but Professor McGonagall showed
the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in,
standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering
about nervously.
“Welcome to Hogwarts,” said Professor McGonagall. “The start-of-term
banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall,
you will be sorted into your Houses. The Sorting is a very importantceremony because, while you are here, your House will be something like
your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your
House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free time in your House
common room.
“The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and
Slytherin. Each House has its own noble history and each has produced
outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs
will earn your House points, while any rule-breaking will lose House points.
At the end of the s glory; a feeling exacerbated, perhaps,
by the fact that Hufflepuff House very rarely got any glory, and that Cedric
was one of the few who had ever given them any, having beaten Gryffindor
once at Quidditch. Ernie Macmillan and Justin Finch-Fletchley, with whom
Harry normally got on very well, did not talk to him even though they were
repotting Bouncing Bulbs at the same tray — 
though they did laugh rather
unpleasantly when one of the Bouncing Bulbs wriggled free from Harry’s grip
and smacked him hard in the face. Ron wasn’t talking to Harry either.
Hermione sat between them, making very forced conversation, but though
both answered her normally, they avoided making eye contact with each
other. Harry thought even Professor Sprout seemed distant with him — 
but
then, she was Head of Hufflepuff House.
He would have been looking forward to seeing Hagrid under normal
circumstances, but Care of Magical Creatures meant seeing the Slytherins too

air, gave Harry one upside-down look of deepest loathing and, with another
loud crack, vanished.
“Good,” said Dumbledore. “There is also the matter of the hippogriff,
Buckbeak. Hagrid has been looking after him since Sirius died, but Buckbeak
is yours now, so if you would prefer to make different arrangements —”
“No,” said Harry at once, “he can stay with Hagrid. I think Buckbeak
would prefer that.”
“Hagrid will be delighted,” said Dumbledore, smiling. “He was thrilled to
see Buckbeak again. Incidentally, we have decided, in the interests of
Buckbeak’s safety, to rechristen him ‘Witherwings’ for the time being, though
I doubt that the Ministry would ever guess he is the hippogriff they once
sentenced to death. Now, Harry, is your trunk packed?”
“Erm . . .”
“Doubtful that I would turn up?” Dumbledore suggested shrewdly.
“I’ll just go and — er — finish off,” said Harry hastily, hurrying to pick up
his fallen telescope and trainers.
It took him a little over ten d. I’ll
make it quick. And then you and Macnair need to sign it. Macnair, you’re
supposed to listen too, that’s procedure —”
Macnair’s face vanished from the window. It was now or never.
“Wait here,” Harry whispered to Hermione. “I’ll do it.”
As Fudge’s voice started again, Harry darted out from behind his tree,
vaulted the fence into the pumpkin patch, and approached Buckbeak.
“It is the decision of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous
Creatures that the hippogriff Buckbeak, hereafter called the condemned, shall
be executed on the sixth of June at sundown —”
Careful not to blink, Harry stared up into Buckbeak’s fierce orange eyes
once more and bowed. Buckbeak sank to his scaly knees and then stood up
again. Harry began to fumble with the knot of rope tying Buckbeak to the
fence.
“. . . sentenced to execution by beheading, to be carried out by the
Committee’s appointed executioner, Walden Macnair . . .”
“Come on, Buckbeak,” Harry murmured, “come on, we’re going to help
you. Quietly . . . quietly . . .” 
“How — how — ?” said Black weakly, staring at the hippogriff.
“Get on — there’s not much time,” said Harry, gripping Buckbeak firmly
on either side of his sleek neck to hold him steady. “You’ve got to get out of
here — the dementors are coming — Macnair’s gone to get them.”
Black placed a hand on either side of the window frame and heaved his
head and shoulders out of it. It was very lucky he was so thin. In seconds, he
had managed to fling one leg over Buckbeak’s back and pull himself onto the
hippogriff behind Hermione.
“Okay, Buckbeak, up!” said Harry, shaking the rope. “Up to the tower —
come on!”
The hippogriff gave one sweep of its mighty wings and they were soaring
upward again, high as the top of the West Tower. Buckbeak landed with a
clatter on the battlements, and Harry and Hermione slid off him at once.
“Sirius, you’d better go, quick,” Harry panted. “They’ll reach Flitwick’s
office any moment, they’ll find out you’re gone.”
Buckbeak pawed the ground, tossing his sharp head.
“What happened to the "
Who is the founder of Gryffindor House?,Godric Gryffindor,The founder of Gryffindor House is Godric Gryffindor.,"was in Dumbledore’s office,
knowing he would shortly be telling him about the dream. Harry looked up at
the walls behind the desk. The patched and ragged Sorting Hat was standing
on a shelf. A glass case next to it held a magnificent silver sword with large
rubies set into the hilt, which Harry recognized as the one he himself had
pulled out of the Sorting Hat in his second year. The sword had once belonged
to Godric Gryffindor, founder of Harry’s House. He was gazing at it,
remembering how it had come to his aid when he had thought all hope was
lost, when he noticed a patch of silvery light, dancing and shimmering on the
glass case. He looked around for the source of the light and saw a sliver of
silver-white shining brightly from within a black cabinet behind him, whose
door had not been closed properly. Harry hesitated, glanced at Fawkes, then
got up, walked across the office, and pulled open the cabinet door.A shallow stone basin lay there, with odd carvings around the edge: runes
and symbols that Harry d  he looked like a radish with a bad sunburn.
“. . . for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years, I
award Gryffindor House fifty points.”
Gryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; the stars overhead
seemed to quiver. Percy could be heard telling the other prefects, “My
brother, you know! My youngest brother! Got past McGonagall’s giant chess
set!”
At last there was silence again.
“Second — to Miss Hermione Granger . . . for the use of cool logic in the
face of fire, I award Gryffindor House fifty points.”
Hermione buried her face in her arms; Harry strongly suspected she hadburst into tears. Gryffindors up and down the table were beside themselves —
they were a hundred points up.
“Third — to Mr. Harry Potter . . .” said Dumbledore. The room went
deadly quiet. “. . . for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor
House sixty points.”
The din was deafening. Those who could add up while yelling themselves
hoarse knew that Gryffindor now had four hundred and seventy-t rom a doorway to the right — the
rest of the school must already be here — but Professor McGonagall showed
the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in,

“Yeah, we don’t need to hear about you being in love with Malfoy,” Harry
told Kreacher. “Let’s fast forward to where he’s actually been going.”
Kreacher bowed again, looking furious, and then said, “Master Malfoy eats
in the Great Hall, he sleeps in a dormitory in the dungeons, he attends his
classes in a variety of —”
“Dobby, you tell me,” said Harry, cutting across Kreacher. “Has he been
going anywhere he shouldn’t have?”
“Harry Potter, sir,” squeaked Dobby, his great orblike eyes shining in the
firelight, “the Malfoy boy is breaking no rules that Dobby can discover, but
he is still keen to avoid detection. He has been making regular visits to the

forehead with

 Hermione and Ron stared at him.

“You see?” he whispered. “It was a name I was already using at Hogwarts,
to my most intimate friends only, of course. You think I was going to use my
filthy Muggle father’s name forever? I, in whose veins runs the blood of
Salazar Slytherin himself, through my mother’s side? I, keep the name of a
foul, common Muggle, who abandoned me even before I was born, just
because he found out his wife was a witch? No, Harry — I fashioned myself a
new name, a name I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak,when I had become the greatest sorcerer in the world!”
Harry’s brain seemed to have jammed. He stared numbly at Riddle, at the
orphaned boy who had grown up to murder Harry’s own parents, and so many
others. . . . At last he forced himself to speak.
“You’re not,” he said, his quiet voice full of hatred.
“Not what?” snapped Riddle.
“Not the greatest sorcerer in the world,” said Harry, breathing fast. “Sorry
to disappoint you and all that, but the grea “Ah, speak not the

“Sorry,” said Harry quickly. “I know lots of people don’t like it. My friend

He stopped again. Thinking about Ron was painful, too.
Dobby leaned toward Harry, his eyes wide as headlights.
“Dobby heard tell,” he said hoarsely, “that Harry Potter met the Dark Lord
for a second time, just weeks ago . . . that Harry Potter escaped 
yet again.
”
Harry nodded and Dobby’s eyes suddenly shone with tears.
“Ah, sir,” he gasped, dabbing his face with a corner of the grubby
pillowcase he was wearing. “Harry Potter is valiant and bold! He has braved
so many dangers already! But Dobby has come to protect Harry Potter, to
warn him, even if he 
does
 have to shut his ears in the oven door later. . . .
Harry Potter must not go back to Hogwarts.

There was a silence broken only by the chink of knives and forks from
downstairs and the distant rumble of Uncle Vernon’s voice.
“W-what?” Harry stammered. “But I’ve got to go back — term starts on
