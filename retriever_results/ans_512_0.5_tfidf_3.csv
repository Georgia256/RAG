sniggered, but Slughorn showed no dismay; on the contrary, he beamed and
looked from Hermione to Harry, who was sitting next to her.
“Oho! 
‘One of my best friends is Muggle-born, and she’s the best in our
year!’
 I’m assuming this is the very friend of whom you spoke, Harry?”
“Yes, sir,” said Harry.
“Well, well, take twenty well-earned points for Gryffindor, Miss Granger,”
said Slughorn genially.
Malfoy looked rather as he had done the time Hermione had punched him
in the face. Hermione turned to Harry wi e three Weasley boys, Harry, Hermione, and Ginny.
“All these yours, Arthur?”
“Oh no, only the redheads,” said Mr. Weasley, pointing out his children.
“This is Hermione, friend of Ron’s — and Harry, another friend —”
“Merlin’s beard,” said Amos Diggory, his eyes widening. “Harry? Harry
Potter
?”
“Er — yeah,” said Harry.
Harry was used to people looking curiously at him when they met him,
used to the way their eyes moved at once to the lightning scar on his forehead,
but it always made him feel uncomfortable."

“Welcome to Hogwarts,” said Professor McGonagall. “The start-of-term
banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall,
you will be sorted into your Houses. The Sorting is a very importantceremony because, while you are here, your House will be something like
your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your
House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free time in your House
common room.
“The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuf he’s going to kill me
too. . . . You’ve got to help me, Remus. . . .”
Black’s face looked more skull-like than ever as he stared at Pettigrew with
his fathomless eyes.
“No one’s going to try and kill you until we’ve sorted a few things out,”
said Lupin.
“Sorted things out?” squealed Pettigrew, looking wildly about him once
more, eyes taking in the boarded windows and, again, the only door. “I knew
he’d come after me! I knew he’d be back for me! I’ve been waiting for this
for twelve years!”
“You knew Sirius   Harry again. “I was awake half the night thinking it all over, and I believe

“Hang on, there’s a P.S. . . .”
I thought your friend Ron might like to keep this owl, as it’s my fault
he no longer has a rat.
Ron’s eyes widened. The minute owl was still hooting excitedly.
“Keep him?” he said uncertainly. He looked closely at the owl for a
moment; then, to Harry’s and Hermione’s great surprise, he held him out for
Crookshanks to sniff.
“What d’you reckon?” Ron asked the cat. “Definitely an owl?”Crookshanks purred.
“That’s good enough for me,” said Ron happily. “He’s  as though a large balloon was
swelling inside him. He went straight to the window and jerked it open. The
owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of Hagrid, who didn’t
wake up. The owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to attack Hagrid’scoat.
“Don’t do that.”
Harry tried to wave the owl out of the way, but it snapped its beak fiercely
at him and carried on savaging the coat.
“Hagrid!” said Harry loudly. “There’s an owl —”

not seem to be making a sound. Harry did not have to look far for the solution

you said —”
“Professor Snape, meanwhile,” said Dumbledore, raising his voice so that it
carried over all the muttering, “will be taking over the position of Defense

“No!” said Harry,  We are also looking for new

The word echoed all over the Hall as people wondered whether they had

“Potions?” said Ron and Hermione t Percy.
“N-nothing.”
The pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder to shake off was the
feeling Harry had gotten from the teacher’s look — a feeling that he didn’t
like Harry at all.
“Who’s that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?” he asked Percy.
“Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder he’s looking so
nervous, that’s Professor Snape. He teaches Potions, but he doesn’t want to —

persuade Slughorn to hand over the true memory, b was still fighting his way across the
lake with the first years; Professor McGonagall was presumably supervisingthe drying of the entrance hall floor, but there was another empty chair too,
and Harry couldn’t think who else was missing.
“Where’s the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher?” said Hermione,
who was also looking up at the teachers.
They had never yet had a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher who had
lasted more than three terms. Harry’s favorite by far had been Professor

They had never yet had a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher who had
lasted more than three terms. Harry’s favorite by far had been Professor
Lupin, who had resigned last year. He looked up and down the staff table.
There was definitely no new face there.
“Maybe they couldn’t get anyone!” said Hermione, looking anxious.
Harry scanned the table more carefully. Tiny little Professor Flitwick, the
Charms teacher, wa"

was looking through the bronze doors at the inner hall, each of the guards
gave a little start as the spells hit them.
Hermione’s long black hair rippled behind her as she climbed the steps.
“One moment, madam,” said the guard, raising his Probe.
“But you’ve just done that!”   knew you’d seen me coming to look at what was guarding
the Stone.”
“
You
 let the troll in?”
“Certainly. I have a special gift with trolls — you must have seen what I
did to the one in the chamber back there? Unfortunately, while everyone else
was running around looking for it, Snape, who already suspected me, went
straight to the third floor to head me off — and not only did my troll fail to
beat you to death, that three-headed dog didn’t even manage to bite Snape’s
leg off properly.
“Now, wait quietly, P ht into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a dog thatfilled the whole space between ceiling and floor. It had three heads. Three
pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching and quivering in their
direction; three drooling mouths, saliva hanging in slippery ropes from
yellowish fangs.
It was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and Harry knew that
the only reason they weren’t already dead was that their sudden appearance
had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over that, there wa"

something more suitable, I think . . . and he said he’d bring some bottles so
we can drink to Aragog’s memory. . . .”
“Did he?” said Hagrid, looking both astonished and touched. “Tha’s —
tha’s righ’ nice of him, that is, an’ not turnin’ yeh in either. I’ve never really
had a lot ter do with Horace Slughorn before. . . . Comin’ ter see old Aragog
off, though, eh? Well . . . he’d’ve liked that, Aragog would. . . .”
Harry thought privately that what  pes shifted all around him.
“The thing that lives in the castle,” said Aragog, “is an ancient creature we
spiders fear above all others. Well do I remember how I pleaded with Hagrid
to let me go, when I sensed the beast moving about the school.”
“What is it?” said Harry urgently.
More loud clicking, more rustling; the spiders seemed to be closing in.
“We do not speak of it!” said Aragog fiercely. “We do not name it! I never
even told Hagrid the name of that dread creature, though he asked me, many
times.”

beyond imagining, pain past endurance —
He was gone from the hall, he was locked in the coils of a creature with red
eyes, so tightly bound that Harry did not know where his body ended and the
creature’s began. They were fused together, bound by pain, and there was no
escape —
And when the creature spoke, it used Harry’s mouth, so that in his agony he
felt his jaw move. . . .
“Kill me now, Dumbledore . . .”
Blinded and dying, every part of him screaming for release, Harry felt the
creature use him again"

“She’s not that bad,” said Harry. “Ugly, though,” he added hastily, as Ginny
raised her eyebrows, and she let out a reluctant giggle.
“Well, I suppose if Mum can stand it, I can.”
“Anyone else we know died?” Ron asked Hermione, who was perusing the
Evening Prophet.
Hermione winced at the forced toughness in his v did not quite see how it happened, both women were
crying and hugging each other. Completely bewildered, wondering whether
the world had gone mad, he turned around: Ron looked as stunned as he felt
and Ginny and Hermione were exchanging startled looks.
“You see!” said a strained voice. Tonks was glaring at Lupin. “She still
wants to marry him, even though he’s been bitten! She doesn’t care!”
“It’s different,” said Lupin, barely moving his lips and looking suddenly
tense. “Bill will not be a full werewolf. T at he now had a great
liking for very rare steaks.

Bill’s pillows, “because ze British overcook their meat, I ’ave always said

fast as they could. Hermione looked after them curiously, until the man with
the bloodied bandage came staggering right across her path.
“My children!” he bellowed, pointing at her. His voice was cracked, high-
pitched; he sounded distraught. “Where are my children? What has he done
with them? You know,

“I — I really —” stammered Hermione.
The man lunged at her, reaching for her throat: Then, with a bang and a
burst of red light he was thrown back owever, it was in his usual curt voice.
“We must follow the rules, and the rules state clearly that those people
whose names come out of the Goblet of Fire are bound to compete in the
tournament.”
“Well, Barty knows the rule book back to front,” said Bagman, beaming
and turning back to Karkaroff and Madame Maxime, as though the matter
was now closed.

“Yeah, but that’s another thing, how did they get premises?” said Ron,
hitting his teacup so hard with his wand that its legs collapsed again and it lay
twitching before him. “It’s a bit dodgy, isn’t it? They’ll need loads of
Galleons to afford the rent on a place in Diagon Alley, she’ll want to know
what they’ve been up to, to get their hands on that sort of gold . . .”
“Well, yes, that occurre

“Your mum said the shop’s going well,” said Harry. “Said Fred and George
have got a real flair for business.”
“That’s an understatement,” said Ron. “They’re raking in the Galleons! I
can’t wait to see the place, we haven’t been to Diagon Alley yet, because
Mum says Dad’s got to be there for extra security and he’s been really busy at
work, but it sounds excellent.”
“And what about Percy?” asked Harry; the third-eldest Weasley brother had
fallen out with the  eon.
“In Diagon Alley,” said Dumbledore. “I have your list of books and schoolequipment with me. I can help you find everything —”
“You’re coming with me?” asked Riddle, looking up.
“Certainly, if you —”
“I don’t need you,” said Riddle. “I’m used to doing things for myself, I go

Who is the head of Slytherin House?,Severus Snape,The head of Slytherin House is Salazar Slytherin.,"considered putting 
him
 in Slytherin. He could remember, as though it were
yesterday, the small voice that had spoken in his ear when he’d placed the hat
on his head a year before: 
You could be great, you know, it’s all here in your
head, and Slytherin would help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about
that. . . .
But Harry, who had already heard of Slytherin House’s reputation forturning out Dark wizards, had thought desperately, 
Not Slytherin!
 and the hat
had said, 
Oh, well, if you’re sure . . .  , I see. Not a bad mind either. There’s talent, oh my goodness, yes —
and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that’s interesting. . . . So where shall I
put you?”
Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, 
Not Slytherin, not
Slytherin.
“Not Slytherin, eh?” said the small voice. “Are you sure? You could be
great, you know, it’s all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the
way to greatness, no doubt about that — no? Well, if you’re sure — better be

Harry heard the hat shout  f, Ravenclaw, and

outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs
will earn your House points, while any rule-breaking will lose House points.
At the end of the year, the House with the most points is awarded the House
Cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever House
becomes yours.

“Good luck?” Harry repeated as the door closed behind Dumbledore.
“Three turns? What’s he talking about? What are we supposed to do?”
But Hermione was fumbling with the neck of her robes, pulling from
beneath them a very long, very fine gold chain.
“Harry, come here,” she said urgently. 
“Quick!”
Harry moved toward her, completely bewildered. She was holding th mber this, both

“Yeah . . . I — er . . . thanks,” said Harry weakly.
“What is this thing?” said Moody, drawing the Marauder’s Map out of his
pocket and unfolding it.
“Map of Hogwarts,” said Harry, hoping Moody was going to pull him out
of the staircase soon; his leg was really hurting him.
“Merlin’s beard,” Moody whispered, staring at the map, his magical eye
going haywire. “This . . . this is some map, Potter!”
“Yeah, it’s . . . quite useful,” Harry said. His eyes were starting to water
from the pain. “Er — Professor   So I waited and watched. I used the map I had taken from Harry
Potter. The map that had almost ruined everything.”
“Map?” said Dumbledore quickly. “What map is this?”
“Potter’s map of Hogwarts. Potter saw me on it. Potter saw me stealing
more ingredients for the Polyjuice Potion from Snape’s office one night. He
thought I was my father. We have the same first name. I took the map from
Potter that night. I told him my father hated Dark wizards. Potter believed my
father was after Snape.

and the Marauder’s Map fluttered out of his hand and slid down six stairs,
where, sunk in the step to above his knee, he couldn’t reach it.

open, and began wailing loudly in the corridor below. Harry pulled out hiswand and struggled to touch the Marauder’s Map, to wipe it blank, but it was

gracefully to her feet, shook back her sheet of silvery blonde hair, and swept
up between the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables.
“Oh look, they’re all disappointed,” Hermione said over the noise, nodding
toward the remainder of the Beauxbatons party. “Disappointed” was a bit of
an understatement, Harry thought. Two  .
Dear Sirius,
You told me to keep you posted on what’s happening at Hogwarts,
so here goes — 
I don’t know if you’ve heard, but the Triwizard
Tournament’s happening this year and on Saturday night I got
picked as a fourth champion. I don’t know who put my name in the
Goblet of Fire, because I didn’t. The other Hogwarts champion is
Cedric Diggory, from Hufflepuff.
He paused at this point, thinking. He had an urge to say something about
the large weight of anxiety that seemed to have settled inside his chest ance of the sign in the entrance hall had a marked effect upon
the inhabitants of the castle. During the following week, there seemed to be
only one topic of conversation, no matter where Harry went: the Triwizard
Tournament. Rumors were flying from student to student like highly
contagious germs: who was going to try for Hogwarts champion, what the
tournament would involve, how the students from Beauxbatons and
Durmstrang differed from themselves.
Harry noticed too that the castle seemed to be undergoing a"

“Stop saying the name!” said Ron in a terrified whisper, as if he thought
Voldemort could hear them.
Harry wasn’t listening.
“Firenze saved me, but he shouldn’t have done so. . . . Bane was furious . . .

stars as well.”
“Will you stop saying the name!”
 Ron hissed.
“So all I’ve  gain.
“Well,” said Lupin, frowning slightly, “I assumed that if the boggart faced
you, it would assume the shape of Lord Voldemort.”
Harry stared. Not only was this the last answer he’d expected, but Lupin
had said Voldemort’s name. The only person Harry had ever heard say the
name aloud (apart from himself) was Professor Dumbledore.
“Clearly, I was wrong,” said Lupin, still frowning at Harry. “But I didn’t

“It wasn’t like that,” said Harry through gritted teeth. His scar was burning:
He felt angry and frustrated; he hated the idea that they were all imagining
him to have power to match Voldemort’s.
No one said anything. He knew that they did not belie of Umbridge, who was
watching coolly from near the doors into the entrance hall.
“Oh bravo!” cried Professor Tofty, who was examining Harry again, whenHarry demonstrated a perfect boggart banishing spell. “Very good indeed!

He leaned forward a little.

he had seen — then he jerked his head around to look again. There was a

Attracted no doubt by Malfoy’s shout, Argus Filch came

back, clutching his face in horror.
“My cat! My cat! What’s happened to Mrs. Norris?” he shrieked.
And drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on
the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a
statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didn’t
so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two
owls swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved

Ron gave an involuntary shudder.
“Years back, there were a lot of witches and wizards being controlled by
the Imperius Curse,” said Moody, and Harry knew he was talking about the
days in which Voldemort had been all-powerful. “Some job for the Ministry,
trying to sort out who was being forced to act, and who was acting of their
own free will.
“The Imperius Curse can be fought, and I’ll be teaching you how, but it
takes real strength of character, and not everyone’s got it. Better a the Imperius Curse lift. Once he’d got his
voice back, he’d explain what he’d been doing, wouldn’t he? They would
have known he’d been sent to steal the weapon. Of course, it would have been
easy for Lucius Malfoy to put the curse on him. Never out of the Ministry, is
he?”
“He was even hanging around that day I had my hearing,” said Harry. “In

corridor that day! Your dad said he was probably trying to sneak down and
find out what ha  a raid on his
Clapham home . . .’”
“Stan Shunpike, a Death Eater?” said Harry, remembering the spotty youth
he had first met three years before. “No way!”
“He might have been put under the Imperius Curse,” said Ron reasonably.
“You never can tell.”
“It doesn’t look like it,” said Hermione, who was still reading. “It says here
he was arrested after he was overheard talking about the Death Eaters’ secret
plans in a pub.” She looked up with a troubled expression on her face. “If he

Harry looked at his watch and hurriedly put the old copy of 
Advanced

 back into his bag.
“It’s five to eight, I’d better go, I’ll be late for Dumbledore.”
“Ooooh!” gasped Hermione, looking up at once. “Good luck! We’ll wait

“Hope it goes okay,” said Ron, and the pair of them watched Harry leave
through the portrait hole.
Harry proceeded through rts, except now it’s just the Dark Arts. We’re supposed to practice the

“What?”
Harry, Ron, and Hermione’s united voices echoed up and down the
passage.
“Yeah,” said Neville. “That’s how I got this one,” he pointed at a
particularly deep gash in his cheek, “I refused to do it. Some people are into
it, though; Crabbe and Goyle love it. First time they’ve ever been top in

“Alecto, Amycus’s sister, teaches Muggle Studies, which is compul very important!” said Hermione, shocked.
“Not the way Lockhart teaches it,” said Ron. “I haven’t learned anything

Neville Longbottom had been sent letters from all the witches and wizards
in his family, all giving him different advice on what to choose. Confused and
worried, he sat reading the subject lists with his tongue poking out, asking
people whether they thought Arithmancy sounded more difficult than Study

“Yeah, that is weird,” said Harry, frowning. “I heard him telling Crabbe it

Harry’s voice tailed away; he was staring at the fire.
“God, I’ve been stupid,” he said quietly. “It’s obvious, isn’t it? There was a
great vat of it down in the dungeon. . . . He could’ve nicked some any time

“Nicked what?” said Ron.

“Th er loved me. He
agreed. They came to visit me. They gave me a draught of Polyjuice Potion

“No,” he said. “
She

“W-what?”
He closed his eyes. He could still smell Bathilda’s house on him: It made
the whole thing horribly vivid.
“Bathilda must’ve been dead a while. The snake was . . . was inside her.
You-Know-Who put it there in Godric’s Hollow, to wait. You were right. He

“The snake was

He opened hi ot know how I got there.”
Harry hardly dared believe her, yet his heart was lightening almost in spite
of himself.
“That dream I had about your dad and the snake, though —”
“Harry, you’ve had these dreams before,” Hermione said. “You had flashes
of what Voldemort was up to last year.”
“This was different,” said Harry, shaking his head. “I was inside that snake.
It was like I 
was

to London — ?”
“One day,” said Hermione, sounding thoroughly exasperat serpent, which relinquished its hold
upon Voldemort at once and turned, hissing furiously, to face Dumbledore.
Voldemort vanished. The snake reared from the floor, ready to strike —
There was a burst of flame in midair above Dumbledore just as Voldemort
reappeared, standing on the plinth in the middle of the pool where so recently
the five statues had stood.
“Look out!” 
Harry yelled.
But even as he shouted, one more jet of green light had flown at

interested in playing for their House teams should contact Madam Hooch.
“And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor on the
right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very
painful death.”
Harry laughed, but he was one of the few who did.
“He’s not serious?” he mu voice, “I’ll see you at the feast. Have a good time.”
He accompanied them to the entrance hall, where Filch, the caretaker, was
standing inside the front doors, checking off names against a long list, peering
suspiciously into every face, and making sure that no one was sneaking out
who shouldn’t be going.
“Staying here, Potter?” shouted Malfoy, who was standing in line with
Crabbe and Goyle. “Scared of passing the dementors?”
Harry ignored him and made his solitary way up the marble staircase,
through the   excursion carefully, because he had been caught out of
bed and out-of-bounds by Filch the caretaker in the middle of the night once
before, and had no desire to repeat the experience. The Invisibility Cloak
would, of course, be essential, and as an added precaution, Harry thought he
would take the Marauder’s Map, which, next to the Cloak, was the most
useful aid to rule-breaking Harry owned. The map showed the whole of
Hogwarts, including its many shortcuts and secret passageways and, most

“How did you know — ?”
“I don’t need a cloak to become invisible,” said Dumbledore gently. “Now,
can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?”
Harry shook his head.
“Let me explain. The happiest man on earth would be able to use the
Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it and see
himself exactly as he is. Does that help?”
Harry thought. Then he said slo  see that he was smiling.
“So,” said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with Harry,
“you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of
Erised.”
“I didn’t know it was called that, sir.”
“But I expect you’ve realized by now what it does?”
“It — well — it shows me my family —”
“And it showed your friend Ron himself as Head Boy.”
“How did you know — ?”
“I don’t need a cloak to become invisible,” said Dumbledore gently. “Now,
can you think what the Mirror of Erised s otter. I need to examine this interesting mirror.”
It was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell. It
was the Mirror of Erised.
“This mirror is the key to finding the Stone,” Quirrell murmured, tapping
his way around the frame. “Trust Dumbledore to come up with something like
this . . . but he’s in London . . . I’ll be far away by the time he gets back. . . .”
All Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and stop him
from concentrating on the mirror.

“Stop moving!” Hermione ordered them. “I know what this is — it’s

“Oh, I’m so glad we know what it’s called, that’s a great help,” snarled
Ron, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck.
“Shut up, I’m h!”
She leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. She had to struggle
because the moment she had landed, the plant had started to twist snakelike
tendrils around her ankles. As for Harry and Ron, their legs had already been
bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing.

He passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry he had never tasted
anything so wonderful, but he still couldn’t take his eyes off the giant. Finally,
as nobody seemed about to explain anything, he said, “I’m sorry, but I still

The giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand.

were under seventeen from entering the tournament.

drops of Aging Potion might do it, George. . . .”

Fred shrewdly. “Sounds to me like once this judge knows who w ione patted Hagrid’s shoulder, looking at a complete loss for anything
