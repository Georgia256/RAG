Who is Harry Potter's best friend?,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter's best friend is Ron Weasley.,"his, “likes his comfort. He also likes the company of the famous, the
successful, and the powerful. He enjoys the feeling that he influences these
people. He has never wanted to occupy the throne himself; he prefers the
backseat — more room to spread out, you see. He used to handpick favorites
at Hogwarts, sometimes for their ambition or their brains, sometimes for their
charm or their talent, and he had an uncanny knack for choosing those who
would go on to become outstanding in their various fields. Horace formed a
kind of club of his favorites with himself at the center, making introductions,
forging useful contacts between members, and always reaping some kind of
benefit in return, whether a free box of his favorite crystalized pineapple or
the chance to recommend the next junior member of the Goblin Liaison
Office.”
Harry had a sudden and vivid mental image of a great swollen spider,
spinning a web around it, twitching a thread here and there to bring its large
and juicy flies a little closer.
“I tell yo 
sniggered, but Slughorn showed no dismay; on the contrary, he beamed and
looked from Hermione to Harry, who was sitting next to her.
“Oho! 
‘One of my best friends is Muggle-born, and she’s the best in our
year!’
 I’m assuming this is the very friend of whom you spoke, Harry?”
“Yes, sir,” said Harry.
“Well, well, take twenty well-earned points for Gryffindor, Miss Granger,”
said Slughorn genially.
Malfoy looked rather as he had done the time Hermione had punched him
in the face. Hermione turned to Harry with a radiant expression and
whispered, “Did you really tell him I’m the best in the year? Oh, Harry!”
“Well, what’s so impressive about that?” whispered Ron, who for somereason looked annoyed. “You 
are
 the best in the year — I’d’ve told him so if
he’d asked me!”
Hermione smiled but made a “shhing” gesture, so that they could hear what
Slughorn was saying. Ron looked slightly disgruntled.
“Amortentia doesn’t really create 
love,
 of course. It is impossible to
manufacture or imitate love. No, this will sim nspiring and the best loved of all Hogwarts headmasters cannot be in
question. He died as he lived: working always for the greater good and,
to his last hour, as willing to stretch out a hand to a small boy with
dragon pox as he was on the day that I met him.
Harry finished reading but continued to gaze at the picture accompanying
the obituary. Dumbledore was wearing his familiar, kindly smile, but as he
peered over the top of his half-moon spectacles, he gave the impression, even
in newsprint, of X-raying Harry, whose sadness mingled with a sense of
humiliation.
He had thought he knew Dumbledore quite well, but ever since reading this
obituary he had been forced to recognize that he had barely known him at all.
Never once had he imagined Dumbledore’s childhood or youth; it was as
though he had sprung into being as Harry had known him, venerable and
silver-haired and old. The idea of a teenage Dumbledore was simply odd, like
trying to imagine a stupid Hermione or a friendly Blast-Ended Skrewt.
He had never th urning idly on
the spot to ensure an even heat on his backside.
“Your mother was Muggle-born, of course. Couldn’t believe it when I
found out. Thought she must have been pure-blood, she was so good.”
“One of my best friends is Muggle-born,” said Harry, “and she’s the best in
our year.”
“Funny how that sometimes happens, isn’t it?” said Slughorn.
“Not really,” said Harry coldly.
Slughorn looked down at him in surprise. “You mustn’t think I’mprejudiced!” he said. “No, no, no! Haven’t I just said your mother was one of
my all-time favorite students? And there was Dirk Cresswell in the year after
her too — now Head of the Goblin Liaison Office, of course — another
Muggle-born, a very gifted student, and still gives me excellent inside
information on the goings-on at Gringotts!”
He bounced up and down a little, smiling in a self-satisfied way, and
pointed at the many glittering photograph frames on the dresser, each peopled
with tiny moving occupants.
“All ex-students, all signed. You’ll notice Barnabas Cuffe, edi ell, I would, but he’s always asleep when I go and see him!” said
Lavender fretfully.
“Is he?” said Harry, surprised, for he had found Ron perfectly alert every
time he had been up to the hospital wing, both highly interested in the news of
Dumbledore and Snape’s row and keen to abuse McLaggen as much as
possible.
“Is Hermione Granger still visiting him?” Lavender demanded suddenly.
“Yeah, I think so. Well, they’re friends, aren’t they?” said Harry
uncomfortably.
“Friends, don’t make me laugh,” said Lavender scornfully. “She didn’t talk
to him for weeks after he started going out with me! But I suppose she wants
to make up with him now he’s all 
interesting.  . . . 
”
“Would you call getting poisoned being interesting?” asked Harry.
“Anyway — sorry, got to go — there’s McLaggen coming for a talk about
Quidditch,” said Harry hurriedly, and he dashed sideways through a door
pretending to be solid wall and sprinted down the shortcut that would take
him off to Potions where, thankfully, neither Lavender nor McLag hose friends of Harry Potter’s who are
suffering for their allegiance?” Lee was saying.
“Well, as regular listeners will know, several of the more outspoken
supporters of Harry Potter have now been imprisoned, including Xenophilius
Lovegood, erstwhile editor of 
The Quibbler
,” said Lupin.
“At least he’s still alive!” muttered Ron.
“We have also heard within the last few hours that Rubeus Hagrid” — all
three of them gasped, and so nearly missed the rest of the sentence — “well-
known gamekeeper at Hogwarts School, has narrowly escaped arrest within
the grounds of Hogwarts, where he is rumored to have hosted a ‘Support
Harry Potter’ party in his house. However, Hagrid was not taken into custody,
and is, we believe, on the run.”
“I suppose it helps, when escaping from Death Eaters, if you’ve got a
sixteen-foot-high half brother?” asked Lee.
“It would tend to give you an edge,” agreed Lupin gravely. “May I just add
that while we here at 
Potterwatch
 applaud Hagrid’s spirit, we would urge
even the most devoted o Umbridge came bustling around the far corner, breathless but wearing a
delighted smile.
“It’s him!” she said jubilantly at the sight of Harry on the floor. “Excellent,
Draco, excellent, oh, very good — fifty points to Slytherin! I’ll take him from
here. . . . Stand up, Potter!”
Harry got to his feet, glaring at the pair of them. He had never seen
Umbridge looking so happy. She seized his arm in a vicelike grip and turned,
beaming broadly, to Malfoy. “You hop along and see if you can round up
anymore of them, Draco,” she said. “Tell the others to look in the library —
anybody out of breath — check the bathrooms, Miss Parkinson can do the
girls’ ones — off you go — and you,” she added in her softest, most
dangerous voice, as Malfoy walked away. “You can come with me to the
headmaster’s office, Potter.”
They were at the stone gargoyle within minutes. Harry wondered how
many of the others had been caught. He thought of Ron — Mrs. Weasley
would kill him — and of how Hermione would feel if she was expelled before
s ings at friends from other Houses, eyeing one another’s new haircuts and
robes. Again Harry noticed people putting their heads together to whisper as
he passed; he gritted his teeth and tried to act as though he neither noticed nor
cared.
Luna drifted away from them at the Ravenclaw table. The moment they
reached Gryffindor’s, Ginny was hailed by some fellow fourth years and left
to sit with them; Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Neville found seats together
about halfway down the table between Nearly Headless Nick, the Gryffindor
House ghost, and Parvati Patil and Lavender Brown, the last two of whom
gave Harry airy, overly friendly greetings that made him quite sure they had
stopped talking about him a split second before. He had more important
things to worry about, however: He was looking over the students’ heads to
the staff table that ran along the top wall of the Hall.
“He’s not there.”
Ron and Hermione scanned the staff table too, though there was no real
need; Hagrid’s size made him instantly obvious in any"
What house is Harry Potter sorted into?,Gryffindor,"According to the passage, Ron Weasley hopes to be in Gryffindor, as his parents and brothers were in that house.","rom a doorway to the right — the
rest of the school must already be here — but Professor McGonagall showed
the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in,
standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering
about nervously.
“Welcome to Hogwarts,” said Professor McGonagall. “The start-of-term
banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall,
you will be sorted into your Houses. The Sorting is a very importantceremony because, while you are here, your House will be something like
your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your
House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free time in your House
common room.
“The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and
Slytherin. Each House has its own noble history and each has produced
outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs
will earn your House points, while any rule-breaking will lose House points.
At the end of the House you’ll be in?
I’ve been asking around, and I hope I’m in Gryffindor, it sounds by far the
best; I hear Dumbledore himself was in it, but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn’t
be too bad. . . . Anyway, we’d better go and look for Neville’s toad. You two
had better change, you know, I expect we’ll be there soon.”
And she left, taking the toadless boy with her.“Whatever House I’m in, I hope she’s not in it,” said Ron. He threw his
wand back into his trunk. “Stupid spell — George gave it to me, bet he knew
it was a dud.”
“What House are your brothers in?” asked Harry.
“Gryffindor,” said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling on him again. “Mum
and Dad were in it, too. I don’t know what they’ll say if I’m not. I don’t
suppose Ravenclaw 
would
 be too bad, but imagine if they put me in
Slytherin.”
“That’s the House Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who was in?”
“Yeah,” said Ron. He flopped back into his seat, looking depressed.
“You know, I think the ends of Scabbers’ whiskers are a bit lighter,” said
Harry, trying to take Ron’s mind   year, the House with the most points is awarded the House
Cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever House
becomes yours.
“The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest
of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can
while you are waiting.”
Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville’s cloak, which was fastened
under his left ear, and on Ron’s smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to
flatten his hair.
“I shall return when we are ready for you,” said Professor McGonagall.
“Please wait quietly.”
She left the chamber. Harry swallowed.
“How exactly do they sort us into Houses?” he asked Ron.
“Some sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think he was
joking.”
Harry’s heart gave a horrible jolt. A test? In front of the whole school? But
he didn’t know any magic yet — what on earth would he have to do? He
hadn’t expected something like this the moment they arrived. He looked
around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked  Harry, intrigued.
“Okay,” Harry said, starting off back down the corridor with Hermione,
Ron hurrying to keep up.
“Oh don’t mind me!” the Fat Lady called irritably after them. “Don’t
apologize for bothering me! I’ll just hang here, wide open, until you get back,
shall I?”
“Yeah, thanks!” Ron shouted over his shoulder.
“Hermione, where are we going?” Harry asked, after she had led themdown through six floors, and started down the marble staircase into the
entrance hall.
“You’ll see, you’ll see in a minute!” said Hermione excitedly.
She turned left at the bottom of the staircase and hurried toward the door
through which Cedric Diggory had gone the night after the Goblet of Fire had
regurgitated his and Harry’s names. Harry had never been through here
before. He and Ron followed Hermione down a flight of stone steps, but
instead of ending up in a gloomy underground passage like the one that led to
Snape’s dungeon, they found themselves in a broad stone corridor, brightly lit
with torches, and decorated with che l
area, just in case. So, we’ve given a dozen different houses every protection
we can throw at them. They all look like they could be the place we’re going
to hide you, they’ve all got some connection with the Order: my house,
Kingsley’s place, Molly’s Auntie Muriel’s — you get the idea.”
“Yeah,” said Harry, not entirely truthfully, because he could still spot a
gaping hole in the plan.
“You’ll be going to Tonks’s parents. Once you’re within the boundaries of
the protective enchantments we’ve put on their house, you’ll be able to use a
Portkey to the Burrow. Any questions?”
“Er — yes,” said Harry. “Maybe they won’t know which of the twelve
secure houses I’m heading for at first, but won’t it be sort of obvious once” —
he performed a quick headcount — “fourteen of us fly off toward Tonks’s
parents’?”
“Ah,” said Moody, “I forgot to mention the key point. Fourteen of us won’t
be flying to Tonks’s parents’. There will be seven Harry Potters moving
through the skies tonight, each of them with a companion, each pa frames. There was also an enormous, claw-footed desk, and, sitting on a
shelf behind it, a shabby, tattered wizard’s hat — the 
Sorting Hat.
Harry hesitated. He cast a wary eye around the sleeping witches and
wizards on the walls. Surely it couldn’t hurt if he took the hat down and tried
it on again? Just to see . . . just to make sure it 
had
 put him in the right House
—He walked quietly around the desk, lifted the hat from its shelf, and
lowered it slowly onto his head. It was much too large and slipped down over
his eyes, just as it had done the last time he’d put it on. Harry stared at the
black inside of the hat, waiting. Then a small voice said in his ear, “Bee in
your bonnet, Harry Potter?”
“Er, yes,” Harry muttered. “Er — sorry to bother you — I wanted to ask
—”
“You’ve been wondering whether I put you in the right House,” said the hat
smartly. “Yes . . . you were particularly difficult to place. But I stand by what
I said before” — Harry’s heart leapt — “you 
would
 have done well in
Slytherin —”
Ha don’t care. You can
have it, I don’t really want it.” Harry never wanted to set foot in number
twelve, Grimmauld Place again if he could help it. He thought he would be
haunted forever by the memory of Sirius prowling its dark musty rooms
alone, imprisoned within the place he had wanted so desperately to leave.“That is generous,” said Dumbledore. “We have, however, vacated the
building temporarily.”
“Why?”
“Well,” said Dumbledore, ignoring the mutterings of Uncle Vernon, who
was now being rapped smartly over the head by the persistent glass of mead,
“Black family tradition decreed that the house was handed down the direct
line, to the next male with the name of ‘Black.’ Sirius was the very last of the
line as his younger brother, Regulus, predeceased him and both were
childless. While his will makes it perfectly plain that he wants you to have the
house, it is nevertheless possible that some spell or enchantment has been set
upon the place to ensure that it cannot be owned by anyone other than a
pureblood.”

And you all know the score:
I sort you into Houses
Because that is what I’m for,But this year I’ll go further,
Listen closely to my song:
Though condemned I am to split you
Still I worry that it’s wrong,
Though I must fulfill my duty
And must quarter every year
Still I wonder whether Sorting
May not bring the end I fear.
Oh, know the perils, read the signs,
The warning history shows,
For our Hogwarts is in danger
From external, deadly foes
And we must unite inside her
Or we’ll crumble from within.
I have told you, I have warned you. . . .
Let the Sorting now begin.
 
The hat became motionless once more; applause broke out, though it was
punctured, for the first time in Harry’s memory, with muttering and whispers.
All across the Great Hall students were exchanging remarks with their
neighbors and Harry, clapping along with everyone else, knew exactly what
they were talking about.
“Branched out a bit this year, hasn’t it?” said Ron, his eyebrows raised.
“Too right it has,” said Harry.

What is the name of Harry Potter's owl?,Hedwig,"According to the text, the name of Harry Potter's owl is Hedwig.","rry Potter’s, incidentally, who fought the Death Eaters
alongside him at the Ministry in June and —”
But the rest of this story was obscured by the large birdcage standing on
top of it. Inside it was a magnificent snowy owl. Her amber eyes surveyed the
room imperiously, her head swiveling occasionally to gaze at her snoring
master. Once or twice she clicked her beak impatiently, but Harry was too
deeply asleep to hear her.
A large trunk stood in the very middle of the room. Its lid was open; it
looked expectant; yet it was almost empty but for a residue of old underwear,
sweets, empty ink bottles, and broken quills that coated the very bottom.
Nearby, on the floor, lay a purple leaflet emblazoned with the words:
——— 
ISSUED ON BEHALF OF

The Ministry of Magic
 
PROTECTING YOUR HOME AND FAMILY AGAINST DARK
FORCES
The Wizarding community is currently under threat from an organization
calling itself the Death Eaters. Observing the following simple securityguidelines will help protect you, your family, and yo h was large and gray, keeled right over and lay
motionless. There was a large package tied to its legs.
Harry recognized the unconscious owl at once — his name was Errol, and
he belonged to the Weasley family. Harry dashed to the bed, untied the cords
around Errol’s legs, took off the parcel, and then carried Errol to Hedwig’s
cage. Errol opened one bleary eye, gave a feeble hoot of thanks, and began to
gulp some water.
Harry turned back to the remaining owls. One of them, the large snowy
female, was his own Hedwig. She, too, was carrying a parcel and looked
extremely pleased with herself. She gave Harry an affectionate nip with her
beak as he removed her burden, then flew across the room to join Errol.
Harry didn’t recognize the third owl, a handsome tawny one, but he knew
at once where it had come from, because in addition to a third package, it was
carrying a letter bearing the Hogwarts crest. When Harry relieved this owl of
its burden, it ruffled its feathers importantly, stretched its wings, and took off eeching, hooting, and flapping their wings.
“Harry!” said Hermione breathlessly, plunging her hands into the feathery
mass and pulling out a screech owl bearing a long, cylindrical package. “I
think I know what this means — open this one first!”
Harry ripped off the brown packaging. Out rolled a tightly furled copy of
March’s edition of 
The Quibbler. 
He unrolled it to see his own face grinning
sheepishly at him from the front cover. In large red letters across his picture
were the words:
 
HARRY POTTER SPEAKS OUT AT LAST: THE TRUTH ABOUT HE-
WHO-MUST-NOT-BE-NAMED AND THE NIGHT I SAW HIM
RETURN
 
“It’s good, isn’t it?” said Luna, who had drifted over to the Gryffindor table
and now squeezed herself onto the bench between Fred and Ron. “It came out
yesterday, I asked Dad to send you a free copy. I expect all these,” she waved
a hand at the assembled owls still scrabbling around on the table in front of
Harry, “are letters from readers.”
“That’s what I thought,” said Hermione eagerly, “Harry, d’you mind if we— We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a listof all necessary books and equipment.
Term begins on September 1. We await your owl by no later than July
31.
Yours sincerely,
Minerva McGonagall,
Deputy Headmistress
Questions exploded inside Harry’s head like fireworks and he couldn’t decide
which to ask first. After a few minutes he stammered, “What does it mean,
they await my owl?”
“Gallopin’ Gorgons, that reminds me,” said Hagrid, clapping a hand to his
forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse, and from yet another
pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl — a real, live, rather ruffled-
looking owl — a long quill, and a roll of parchment. With his tongue between
his teeth he scribbled a note that Harry could read upside down:
Dear Professor Dumbledore,
Given Harry his letter.
Taking him to buy his things tomorrow.
Weather’s horrible. Hope you’re well.
Hagrid
Hagrid rolled up the note, gave it to the owl, which  criticize —”
“Ron —”
“I haven’t got time to listen to a sermon, all right, Hermione, I’m up to my
neck in it here —”
“No — look!”
Hermione was pointing to the nearest window. Harry and Ron both looked
over. A handsome screech owl was standing on the windowsill, gazing into
the room at Ron.
“Isn’t that Hermes?” said Hermione, sounding amazed.
“Blimey, it is!” said Ron quietly, throwing down his quill and getting to his
feet. “What’s Percy writing to me for?”
He crossed to the window and opened it; Hermes flew inside, landed upon
Ron’s essay, and held out a leg to which a letter was attached. Ron took it offand the owl departed at once, leaving inky footprints across Ron’s drawing of
the moon Io.
“That’s definitely Percy’s handwriting,” said Ron, sinking back into his
chair and staring at the words on the outside of the scroll: 
To Ronald Weasley,
Gryffindor House, Hogwarts.
 He looked up at the other two. “What d’you
reckon?”
“Open it!” said Hermione eagerly. Harry nodded.
Ron unrolled the scroll and began to er his shoulder. “What’s thatthing outside your window?”
Harry turned to look outside. Something very small and gray was bobbing
in and out of sight beyond the glass. He stood up for a better look and saw
that it was a tiny owl, carrying a letter that was much too big for it. The owl
was so small, in fact, that it kept tumbling over in the air, buffeted this way
and that in the train’s slipstream. Harry quickly pulled down the window,
stretched out his arm, and caught it. It felt like a very fluffy Snitch. He
brought it carefully inside. The owl dropped its letter onto Harry’s seat and
began zooming around their compartment, apparently very pleased with itself
for accomplishing its task. Hedwig clicked her beak with a sort of dignified
disapproval. Crookshanks sat up in his seat, following the owl with his great
yellow eyes. Ron, noticing this, snatched the owl safely out of harm’s way.
Harry picked up the letter. It was addressed to him. He ripped open the
letter, and shouted, “It’s from Sirius!”
“What?” sai d Ron and Hermione excitedly. “Read it aloud!”
Dear Harry,
I hope this finds you before you reach your aunt and uncle. I don’t
know whether they’re used to owl post.
Buckbeak and I are in hiding. I won’t tell you where, in case this falls
into the wrong hands. I have some doubt about the owl’s reliability, but
he is the best I could find, and he did seem eager for the job.
I believe the dementors are still searching for me, but they haven’t a
hope of finding me here. I am planning to allow some Muggles to
glimpse me soon, a long way from Hogwarts, so that the security on the
castle will be lifted.
There is something I never got around to telling you during our brief
meeting. It was I who sent you the Firebolt —
“Ha!” said Hermione triumphantly. “See! I 
told
 you it was from him!”
“Yes, but he hadn’t jinxed it, had he?” said Ron. “Ouch!”
The tiny owl, now hooting happily in his hand, had nibbled one of hisfingers in what it seemed to think was an affectionate way.
Crookshanks took the order to the Owl Office  es go for birds, of course, but
Hagrid’s got the Hogwarts thestrals well trained not to touch owls . . .”
Harry neither knew nor cared what thestrals were, he just wanted to know
that Hedwig was going to be all right. Professor McGonagall, however,
looked sharply at Harry and said, “Do you know how far this owl’s traveled,
Potter?”
“Er,” said Harry. “From London, I think.”
He met her eyes briefly and knew that she understood “London” to mean
“number twelve, Grimmauld Place” by the way her eyebrows had joined in
the middle.
Professor Grubbly-Plank pulled a monocle out of the inside of her robes
and screwed it into her eye to examine Hedwig’s wing closely. “I should be
able to sort this out if you leave her with me, Potter,” she said. “She shouldn’t
be flying long distances for a few days, in any case.”
“Er — right — thanks,” said Harry, just as the bell rang for break.
“No problem,” said Professor Grubbly-Plank gruffly, turning back into the
staffroom.
“Just a moment, Wilhelmina!” said Professor McGonagall. “P"
Who is the headmaster of Hogwarts?,Albus Dumbledore,"According to the text, Albus Dumbledore is the headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.","unfolded it, and read it, with Ron,
Seamus, Dean, and Neville looking over his shoulder. It was an article topped
with a picture of Hagrid looking extremely shifty.
DUMBLEDORE’S GIANT MISTAKE
Albus Dumbledore, eccentric headmaster of Hogwarts School of
Witchcraft and Wizardry, has never been afraid to make
controversial staff appointments, 
writes Rita Skeeter, Special
Correspondent.
 In September of this year, he hired Alastor “Mad-
Eye” Moody, the notoriously jinx-happy ex-Auror, to teach Defense
Against the Dark Arts, a decision that caused many raised eyebrows
at the Ministry of Magic, given Moody’s well-known habit of
attacking anybody who makes a sudden movement in his presence.
Mad-Eye Moody, however, looks responsible and kindly when set
beside the part-human Dumbledore employs to teach Care ofMagical Creatures.
Rubeus Hagrid, who admits to being expelled from Hogwarts in
his third year, has enjoyed the position of gamekeeper at the school
ever since, a job secured for him by Dumbledore. Last year,
ho werewolf Remus Lupin, half-giant Rubeus Hagrid, and delusional
ex-Auror ‘Mad-Eye’ Moody.
“Rumors abound, of course, that Albus Dumbledore, once Supreme
Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards and Chief Warlock
of the Wizengamot, is no longer up to the task of managing the prestigious
school of Hogwarts.
“‘I think the appointment of the Inquisitor is a first step toward ensuring
that Hogwarts has a headmaster in whom we can all repose confidence,’ said
a Ministry insider last night.
“Wizengamot elders Griselda Marchbanks and Tiberius Ogden have
resigned in protest at the introduction of the post of Inquisitor to Hogwarts.
“‘Hogwarts is a school, not an outpost of Cornelius Fudge’s office,’ said
Madam Marchbanks. ‘This is a further disgusting attempt to discredit Albus
Dumbledore.’ (For a full account of Madam Marchbanks’ alleged links to
subversive goblin groups, turn to page 17.)”
Hermione finished reading and looked across the table at the other two.
“So now we know how we ended up with Umbridg Following the
resignation of the previous Muggle Studies teacher, Alecto Carrow will take
over the post while her brother, Amycus, fills the position of Defense Against
the Dark Arts professor.
“
‘I welcome the opportunity to uphold our finest Wizarding traditions and
values —’ 
Like committing murder and cutting off people’s ears, I suppose!
Snape, headmaster! Snape in Dumbledore’s study — Merlin’s pants!” she
shrieked, making both Harry and Ron jump. She leapt up from the table and
hurtled from the room, shouting as she went, “I’ll be back in a minute!”
“‘Merlin’s pants’?” repeated Ron, looking amused. “She must be upset.”
He pulled the newspaper toward him and perused the article about Snape.
“The other teachers won’t stand for this. McGonagall and Flitwick and
Sprout all know the truth, they know how Dumbledore died. They won’t
accept Snape as headmaster. And who are these Carrows?”
“Death Eaters,” said Harry. “There are pictures of them inside. They were
at the top of the tower when Snape killed Dumbledo eep-seated
confusion.
“He might even be pretending,” said one specialist. “This could
be a plea for attention.”
The 
Daily Prophet,
 however, has unearthed worrying facts about
Harry Potter that Albus Dumbledore, headmaster of Hogwarts, has
carefully concealed from the Wizarding public.
“Potter can speak Parseltongue,” reveals Draco Malfoy, a
Hogwarts fourth year. “There were a lot of attacks on students acouple of years ago, and most people thought Potter was behind
them after they saw him lose his temper at a dueling club and set a
snake on another boy. It was all hushed up, though. But he’s made
friends with werewolves and giants too. We think he’d do anything
for a bit of power.”
Parseltongue, the ability to converse with snakes, has long been
considered a Dark Art. Indeed, the most famous Parselmouth of our
times is none other than You-Know-Who himself. A member of the
Dark Force Defense League, who wished to remain unnamed, stated
that he would regard any wizard who could speak Parseltongue “as
worthy o nspiring and the best loved of all Hogwarts headmasters cannot be in
question. He died as he lived: working always for the greater good and,
to his last hour, as willing to stretch out a hand to a small boy with
dragon pox as he was on the day that I met him.
Harry finished reading but continued to gaze at the picture accompanying
the obituary. Dumbledore was wearing his familiar, kindly smile, but as he
peered over the top of his half-moon spectacles, he gave the impression, even
in newsprint, of X-raying Harry, whose sadness mingled with a sense of
humiliation.
He had thought he knew Dumbledore quite well, but ever since reading this
obituary he had been forced to recognize that he had barely known him at all.
Never once had he imagined Dumbledore’s childhood or youth; it was as
though he had sprung into being as Harry had known him, venerable and
silver-haired and old. The idea of a teenage Dumbledore was simply odd, like
trying to imagine a stupid Hermione or a friendly Blast-Ended Skrewt.
He had never th he had just been appointed Head Boy. Harry didn’t realize what he was so
pleased about until the Potions lesson about two weeks after Dumbledore and
Hagrid had left, when, sitting right behind Malfoy, Harry overheard him
gloating to Crabbe and Goyle.
“I always thought Father might be the one who got rid of Dumbledore,” he
said, not troubling to keep his voice down. “I told you he thinks
Dumbledore’s the worst headmaster the school’s ever had. Maybe we’ll get a
decent headmaster now. Someone who won’t 
want
 the Chamber of Secrets
closed. McGonagall won’t last long, she’s only filling in. . . .”
Snape swept past Harry, making no comment about Hermione’s empty seat
and cauldron.
“Sir,” said Malfoy loudly. “Sir, why don’t 
you 
apply for the headmaster’s
job?”
“Now, now, Malfoy,” said Snape, though he couldn’t suppress a thin-lipped
smile. “Professor Dumbledore has only been suspended by the governors. I
daresay he’ll be back with us soon enough.”
“Yeah, right,” said Malfoy, smirking. “I expect you’d have Father you please, Master Harry, and hands washed before dinner,”
croaked Kreacher, seizing the Invisibility Cloak and slouching off to hang iton a hook on the wall, beside a number of old-fashioned robes that had been
freshly laundered.
“What’s happened?” Ron asked apprehensively. He and Hermione had
been poring over a sheaf of scribbled notes and hand-drawn maps that littered
the end of the long kitchen table, but now they watched Harry as he strode
toward them and threw down the newspaper on top of their scattered
parchment.
A large picture of a familiar, hook-nosed, black-haired man stared up at
them all, beneath a headline that read:
SEVERUS SNAPE CONFIRMED AS HOGWARTS HEADMASTER
“No!” said Ron and Hermione loudly.
Hermione was quickest; she snatched up the newspaper and began to read
the accompanying story out loud.
“‘Severus Snape, long-standing Potions master at Hogwarts School of
Witchcraft and Wizardry, was today appointed headmaster in the most
important of several staffing changes at the ancient school.  m
high on the wall: A sallow-faced wizard with a short black fringe had just
walked back into his empty canvas.
“Minerva, the Minister will be here within seconds, he has just
Disapparated from the Ministry.”
“Thank you, Everard,” said Professor McGonagall, and she turned quickly
to her teachers.
“I want to talk about what happens to Hogwarts before he gets here,” she
said quickly. “Personally, I am not convinced that the school should reopen
next year. The death of the headmaster at the hands of one of our colleagues is
a terrible stain upon Hogwarts’s history. It is horrible.”
“I am sure Dumbledore would have wanted the school to remain open,”
said Professor Sprout. “I feel that if a single pupil wants to come, then theschool ought to remain open for that pupil.”
“But will we have a single pupil after this?” said Slughorn, now dabbing
his sweating brow with a silken handkerchief. “Parents will want to keep their
children at home and I can’t say I blame them. Personally, I don’t think we’re
in more danger at"

Anthony Goldstein, his own wand would fly out of his hand, yet Anthony did
not seem to be making a sound. Harry did not have to look far for the solution
of the mystery, however; Fred and George were several feet from Smith and
taking it in turns to point their wands at his back.
“Sorry, Harry,” said George hastily, when Harry caught his eye. “Couldn’t
resist . . .”
Harry walked around the other pairs, trying to correct those who were
doing the spell wrong. Ginny was teamed with Michael Corner; she was
doing very well, whereas Michael was either very bad or unwilling to jinx her.
Ernie Macmillan was flourishing his wand unnecessarily, giving his partner
time to get in under his guard; the Creevey brothers were enthusiastic but
erratic and mainly responsible for all the books leaping off the shelves around
them. Luna Lovegood was similarly patchy, occasionally sending Justin
Finch-Fletchley’s wand spinning out of his hand, at other times merely
causing his hair to stand on end.
“Okay, stop!” Harry s f Zacharias
Smith, who had jeered at Harry for wanting to teach Dumbledore’s Army how
to Disarm.
“Yes, Harry,” said Lupin with painful restraint, “and a great number of
Death Eaters witnessed that happening! Forgive me, but it was a very unusual
move then, under imminent threat of death. Repeating it tonight in front of
Death Eaters who either witnessed or heard about the first occasion was close
to suicidal!”
“So you think I should have killed Stan Shunpike?” said Harry angrily.
“Of course not,” said Lupin, “but the Death Eaters — frankly, most people!
— would have expected you to attack back! Expelliarmus is a useful spell,
Harry, but the Death Eaters seem to think it is your signature move, and I urgeyou not to let it become so!”
Lupin was making Harry feel idiotic, and yet there was still a grain of
defiance inside him.
“I won’t blast people out of my way just because they’re there,” said Harry.
“That’s Voldemort’s job.”
Lupin’s retort was lost: Finally succeeding in squeezing through the door,
Hagrid sta as a
dangerous enemy, another to speak of them, as Snape was doing, with aloving caress in his voice?
“Your defenses,” said Snape, a little louder, “must therefore be as flexible
and inventive as the arts you seek to undo. These pictures” — he indicated a
few of them as he swept past — “give a fair representation of what happens to
those who suffer, for instance, the Cruciatus Curse” — he waved a hand
toward a witch who was clearly shrieking in agony — “feel the Dementor’s
Kiss” — a wizard lying huddled and blank-eyed, slumped against a wall —
“or provoke the aggression of the Inferius” — a bloody mass upon the
ground.
“Has an Inferius been seen, then?” said Parvati Patil in a high-pitched
voice. “Is it definite, is he using them?”
“The Dark Lord has used Inferi in the past,” said Snape, “which means you
would be well-advised to assume he might use them again. Now . . .”
He set off again around the other side of the classroom toward his desk, and
again, they watched him as he walked, his dark robes billowing  ur home from
attack.

“Looks like a really good plan from where I’m standing,” said Harry,
grinning bleakly. “They’ll just have to stand back and let the dragons do their
stuff.”
“Right — these dragons,” said Sirius, speaking very quickly now. “There’s
a way, Harry. Don’t be tempted to try a Stunning Spell — dragons are strong
and too powerfully magical to be knocked out by a single Stunner, you need
about half a dozen wizards at a time to overcome a dragon —”
“Yeah, I know, I just saw,” said Harry.
“But you can do it alone,” said Sirius. “There is a way, and a simple spell’s
all you need. Just —”
But Harry held up a hand to silence him, his heart suddenly pounding as
though it would burst. He could hear footsteps coming down the spiral
staircase behind him.
“Go!” he hissed at Sirius. “
Go!
 There’s someone coming!”Harry scrambled to his feet, hiding the fire — if someone saw Sirius’s face
within the walls of Hogwarts, they would raise an almighty uproar — the
Mi t 
using
 defensive spells.”
There was a short silence in which many members of the class turned their
heads to frown at the three course aims still written on the blackboard.
“
Using
 defensive spells?” Professor Umbridge repeated with a little laugh.
“Why, I can’t imagine any situation arising in my classroom that would
require you to 
use
 a defensive spell, Miss Granger. You surely aren’t
expecting to be attacked during class?”
“We’re not going to use magic?” Ron ejaculated loudly.
“Students raise their hands when they wish to speak in my class, Mr. — ?”
“Weasley,” said Ron, thrusting his hand into the air.
Professor Umbridge, smiling still more widely, turned her back on him.
Harry and Hermione immediately raised their hands too. Professor
Umbridge’s pouchy eyes lingered on Harry for a moment before she
addressed Hermione.
“Yes, Miss Granger? You wanted to ask something else?”
“Yes,” said Hermione. “Surely the whole point of Defense Against the
Dark Arts is to practice defensive spells?”
“Are you a Minis behind him.
“. . . you are, I believe, complete novices in the use of nonverbal spells.
What is the advantage of a nonverbal spell?”
Hermione’s hand shot into the air. Snape took his time looking around at
everybody else, making sure he had no choice, before saying curtly, “Very
well — Miss Granger?”
“Your adversary has no warning about what kind of magic you’re about to
perform,” said Hermione, “which gives you a split-second advantage.”
“An answer copied almost word for word from 
The Standard Book of
Spells, Grade Six,
” said Snape dismissively (over in the corner, Malfoy
sniggered), “but correct in essentials. Yes, those who progress to using magic
without shouting incantations gain an element of surprise in their spell-
casting. Not all wizards can do this, of course; it is a question of concentration
and mind power which some” — his gaze lingered maliciously upon Harry
once more — “lack.”
Harry knew Snape was thinking of their disastrous Occlumency lessons of
the previous year. He refused to drop his ga  Slytherin girl who
reminded Harry of a picture he’d seen in 
Holidays with Hags.
 She was large
and square and her heavy jaw jutted aggressively. Hermione gave her a weak
smile that she did not return.
“Face your partners!” called Lockhart, back on the platform. “And bow!”
Harry and Malfoy barely inclined their heads, not taking their eyes off each
other.
“Wands at the ready!” shouted Lockhart. “When I count to three, cast your
charms to Disarm your opponents — 
only
 to disarm them — we don’t want
any accidents — one . . . two . . . three —”
Harry swung his wand high, but Malfoy had already started on “two”: His
spell hit Harry so hard he felt as though he’d been hit over the head with a
saucepan. He stumbled, but everything still seemed to be working, and
wasting no more time, Harry pointed his wand straight at Malfoy and shouted,
“Rictusempra!”A jet of silver light hit Malfoy in the stomach and he doubled up, wheezing.
“I said Disarm only!”
 Lockhart shouted in alarm over the heads of the
battling crowd, "
Who teaches Potions at Hogwarts?,Severus Snape,"According to the provided context, Professor Snape teaches Potions at Hogwarts."," up a
Love Potion! And while you’re at it, Professor Flitwick knows more about
Entrancing Enchantments than any wizard I’ve ever met, the sly old dog!”
Professor Flitwick buried his face in his hands. Snape was looking as
though the first person to ask him for a Love Potion would be force-fed
poison.
“Please, Hermione, tell me you weren’t one of the forty-six,” said Ron as
they left the Great Hall for their first lesson. Hermione suddenly became very
interested in searching her bag for her schedule and didn’t answer.
All day long, the dwarfs kept barging into their classes to deliver
valentines, to the annoyance of the teachers, and late that afternoon as the
Gryffindors were walking upstairs for Charms, one of the dwarfs caught up
with Harry.
“Oi, you! ’Arry Potter!” shouted a particularly grim-looking dwarf,
elbowing people out of the way to get to Harry.
Hot all over at the thought of being given a valentine in front of a line of
first years, which happened to include Ginny Weasley, Harry tried to escape.
  Thursday afternoon’s double
Potions lesson loomed nearer, “is a diversion. Then one of us can sneak into
Snape’s office and take what we need.”
Harry and Ron looked at her nervously.
“I think I’d better do the actual stealing,” Hermione continued in a matter-
of-fact tone. “You two will be expelled if you get into any more trouble, and
I’ve got a clean record. So all you need to do is cause enough mayhem to
keep Snape busy for five minutes or so.”
Harry smiled feebly. Deliberately causing mayhem in Snape’s Potions class
was about as safe as poking a sleeping dragon in the eye.
Potions lessons took place in one of the large dungeons. Thursday
afternoon’s lesson proceeded in the usual way. Twenty cauldrons stood
steaming between the wooden desks, on which stood brass scales and jars of
ingredients. Snape prowled through the fumes, making waspish remarks about
the Gryffindors’ work while the Slytherins sniggered appreciatively. Draco
Malfoy, who was Snape’s favorite student, kept flicking puffer-fish eyes at
Ro p of tea with me around three? I want to hear all about your
first week. Send us an answer back with Hedwig.
HagridHarry borrowed Ron’s quill, scribbled 
Yes, please, see you later
 on the back
of the note, and sent Hedwig off again.
It was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to, because the
Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so
far.
At the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the idea that Professor Snape
disliked him. By the end of the first Potions lesson, he knew he’d been wrong.
Snape didn’t dislike Harry — he 
hated
 him.
Potions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons. It was colder here
than up in the main castle, and would have been quite creepy enough without
the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls.
Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and like
Flitwick, he paused at Harry’s name.
“Ah, yes,” he said softly, “Harry Potter. Our new — 
celebrity
.”
Draco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and ly were they studying as though they had exams every day, but the
lessons themselves had become more demanding than ever before. Harry
barely understood half of what Professor McGonagall said to them these days;
even Hermione had had to ask her to repeat instructions once or twice.
Incredibly, and to Hermione’s increasing resentment, Harry’s best subject had
suddenly become Potions, thanks to the Half-Blood Prince.
Nonverbal spells were now expected, not only in Defense Against the Dark
Arts, but in Charms and Transfiguration too. Harry frequently looked over at
his classmates in the common room or at mealtimes to see them purple in the
face and straining as though they had overdosed on U-No-Poo; but he knew
that they were really struggling to make spells work without saying
incantations aloud. It was a relief to get outside into the greenhouses; they
were dealing with more dangerous plants than ever in Herbology, but at least
they were still allowed to swear loudly if the Venomous Tentacula seized
them unexp , so
interested, that he was becoming careless with his potion again.
“Salamander blood, Harry!” Hermione moaned, grabbing his wrist to
prevent him adding the wrong ingredient for the third time. “Not pomegranate
juice!”
“Right,” said Harry vaguely, putting down the bottle and continuing towatch the corner. Umbridge had just gotten to her feet. “Ha,” he said softly, as
she strode between two lines of desks toward Snape, who was bending over
Dean Thomas’s cauldron.
“Well, the class seems fairly advanced for their level,” she said briskly to
Snape’s back. “Though I would question whether it is advisable to teach them
a potion like the Strengthening Solution. I think the Ministry would prefer it if
that was removed from the syllabus.”
Snape straightened up slowly and turned to look at her.
“Now . . . how long have you been teaching at Hogwarts?” she asked, her
quill poised over her clipboard.
“Fourteen years,” Snape replied. His expression was unfathomable. His
eyes on Snape, Harry added a few drops to his potio Hogwarts.”
“P-P-Potter,” stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Harry’s hand, “c-
can’t t-tell you how p-pleased I am to meet you.”
“What sort of magic do you teach, Professor Quirrell?”“D-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,” muttered Professor Quirrell, as
though he’d rather not think about it. “N-not that you n-need it, eh, P-P-
Potter?” He laughed nervously. “You’ll be g-getting all your equipment, I
suppose? I’ve g-got to p-pick up a new b-book on vampires, m-myself.” He
looked terrified at the very thought.
But the others wouldn’t let Professor Quirrell keep Harry to himself. It took
almost ten minutes to get away from them all. At last, Hagrid managed to
make himself heard over the babble.
“Must get on — lots ter buy. Come on, Harry.”
Doris Crockford shook Harry’s hand one last time, and Hagrid led them
through the bar and out into a small, walled courtyard, where there was
nothing but a trash can and a few weeds.
Hagrid grinned at Harry.
“Told yeh, didn’t I? Told yeh you was famous. Even Professor Quirr try-trained educational expert, Miss Granger?” asked
Professor Umbridge in her falsely sweet voice.
“No, but —”“Well then, I’m afraid you are not qualified to decide what the ‘whole
point’ of any class is. Wizards much older and cleverer than you have devised
our new program of study. You will be learning about defensive spells in a
secure, risk-free way —”
“What use is that?” said Harry loudly. “If we’re going to be attacked it
won’t be in a —”
“
Hand, 
Mr. Potter!” sang Professor Umbridge.
Harry thrust his fist in the air. Professor Umbridge promptly turned away
from him again, but now several other people had their hands up too.
“And your name is?” Professor Umbridge said to Dean.
“Dean Thomas.”
“Well, Mr. Thomas?”
“Well, it’s like Harry said, isn’t it?” said Dean. “If we’re going to be
attacked, it won’t be risk-free —”
“I repeat,” said Professor Umbridge, smiling in a very irritating fashion at
Dean, “do you expect to be attacked during my classes?”
“No, but —”
Professor Umbridge talked over him.
“I do n warts,” she said. “Anyone messing around in my class will
leave and not come back. You have been warned.”
Then she changed her desk into a pig and back again. They were all very
impressed and couldn’t wait to get started, but soon realized they weren’t
going to be changing the furniture into animals for a long time. After taking a
lot of complicated notes, they were each given a match and started trying to
turn it into a needle. By the end of the lesson, only Hermione Granger had
made any difference to her match; Professor McGonagall showed the class
how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave Hermione a rare smile.
The class everyone had really been looking forward to was Defense
Against the Dark Arts, but Quirrell’s lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke.
His classroom smelled strongly of garlic, which everyone said was to ward
off a vampire he’d met in Romania and was afraid would be coming back to
get him one of these days. His turban, he told them, had been given to him by
an African prince as a tha"

ife at the Burrow was as different as possible from life on Privet Drive.
The Dursleys liked everything neat and ordered; the Weasleys’ house
burst with the strange and unexpected. Harry got a shock the first time he
looked in the mirror over the kitchen mantelpiece and it shouted,
“Tuck your
shirt in, scruffy!”
 The ghoul in the attic howled and dropped pipes whenever
he felt things were getting too quiet, and small explosions from Fred and
George’s bedroom were considered perfectly normal. What Harry found most
unusual about life at Ron’s, however, wasn’t the talking mirror or the clanking
ghoul: It was the fact that everybody there seemed to like him.
Mrs. Weasley fussed over the state of his socks and tried to force him to eat
fourth helpings at every meal. Mr. Weasley liked Harry to sit next to him at
the dinner table so that he could bombard him with questions about life with
Muggles  me 
what,
 Arthur?” Mrs. Weasley repeated, in a dangerous sort of
voice.
“It’s nothing, Molly,” mumbled Mr. Weasley, “Fred and George just — but
I’ve had words with them —”
“What have they done this time?” said Mrs. Weasley. “If it’s got anything
to do with Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes —”
“Why don’t you show Harry where he’s sleeping, Ron?” said Hermione
from the doorway.
“He knows where he’s sleeping,” said Ron, “in my room, he slept there last
—”“We can all go,” said Hermione pointedly.
“Oh,” said Ron, cottoning on. “Right.”
“Yeah, we’ll come too,” said George.
“You stay where you are!”
 snarled Mrs. Weasley.
Harry and Ron edged out of the kitchen, and they, Hermione, and Ginny set
off along the narrow hallway and up the rickety staircase that zigzagged
through the house to the upper stories.
“What are Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes?” Harry asked as they climbed.
Ron and Ginny both laughed, although Hermione didn’t.
“Mum found this stack of order forms when she was cleaning Fred and
George’s room,” said Ron quietly.  Slytherins all sing:
Weasley is our King.
 
Weasley was born in a bin,
He always lets the Quaffle in,
Weasley will make sure we win,
Weasley is our King.
 
“— and Alicia passes back to Angelina!” Lee shouted, and as Harry
swerved, his insides boiling at what he had just heard, he knew Lee was
trying to drown out the sound of the singing. “Come on now, Angelina —
looks like she’s got just the Keeper to beat! — SHE SHOOTS — SHE —
aaaah . . .”
Bletchley, the Slytherin Keeper, had saved the goal; he threw the Quaffle to
Warrington who sped off with it, zigzagging in between Alicia and Katie; the
singing from below grew louder and louder as he drew nearer and nearer Ron—
 
Weasley is our King,
Weasley is our King,
He always lets the Quaffle in,
Weasley is our King.
 
Harry could not help himself: Abandoning his search for the Snitch, he
turned his Firebolt toward Ron, a lone figure at the far end of the pitch,
hovering before the three goal hoops while the massive Warrington pelted
toward him . . .
“— and it’s Wa eir mouths. “There

Sirius half-shrugged but did not argue. Mrs. Weasley beckoned imperiously
to her sons and Hermione. One by one they stood up and Harry, recognizing
defeat, followed suit.M

rs. Weasley followed them upstairs looking grim.
“I want you all to go straight to bed, no talking,” she said as they
reached the first landing. “We’ve got a busy day tomorrow. I expect Ginny’s
asleep,” she added to Hermione, “so try not to wake her up.”
“Asleep, yeah, right,” said Fred in an undertone, after Hermione bade them
good night and they were climbing to the next floor. “If Ginny’s not lying
awake waiting for Hermione to tell her everything they said downstairs, then
I’m a flobberworm . . .”
“All right, Ron, Harry,” said Mrs. Weasley on the second landing, pointing
them into their bedroom. “Off to bed with you.”
“’Night,” Harry and Ron sa d
Mrs. Weasley the usual hand-knitted jumper and some mince pies; and
Dobby, a truly dreadful painting that Harry suspected had been done by theelf himself. He had just turned it upside down to see whether it looked better
that way when, with a loud 
crack, 
Fred and George Apparated at the foot of
his bed.
“Merry Christmas,” said George. “Don’t go downstairs for a bit.”
“Why not?” said Ron.
“Mum’s crying again,” said Fred heavily. “Percy sent back his Christmas
jumper.”
“Without a note,” added George. “Hasn’t asked how Dad is or visited him
or anything . . .”
“We tried to comfort her,” said Fred, moving around the bed to look at
Harry’s portrait. “Told her Percy’s nothing more than a humongous pile of rat
droppings —”
“— didn’t work,” said George, helping himself to a Chocolate Frog. “So
Lupin took over. Best let him cheer her up before we go down for breakfast, I
reckon.”
“What’s that supposed to be anyway?” asked Fred, squinting at Dobby’s
painting. “Looks like a gibbon with two black eyes.”
“It’s Harry!”   Mr. Weasley vanished, Bill and Charlie entered the kitchen.
“Did someone say Mad-Eye?” Bill asked. “What’s he been up to now?”
“He says someone tried to break into his house last night,” said Mrs.
Weasley.
“Mad-Eye Moody?” said George thoughtfully, spreading marmalade on histoast. “Isn’t he that nutter —”
“Your father thinks very highly of Mad-Eye Moody,” said Mrs. Weasley
sternly.
“Yeah, well, Dad collects plugs, doesn’t he?” said Fred quietly as Mrs.
Weasley left the room. “Birds of a feather . . .”
“Moody was a great wizard in his time,” said Bill.
“He’s an old friend of Dumbledore’s, isn’t he?” said Charlie.
“Dumbledore’s not what you’d call 
normal,
 though, is he?” said Fred. “I
mean, I know he’s a genius and everything . . .”
“Who 
is
 Mad-Eye?” asked Harry.
“He’s retired, used to work at the Ministry,” said Charlie. “I met him once
when Dad took me in to work with him. He was an Auror — one of the
best . . . a Dark wizard catcher,” he added, seeing Harry’s blank look. “Half

way down to breakfast, when Mrs. Weasley appeared at the foot of the stairs,
looking harassed.
“Arthur!” she called up the staircase. “Arthur! Urgent message from the
Ministry!”
Harry flattened himself against the wall as Mr. Weasley came clattering
past with his robes on back-to-front and hurtled out of sight. When Harry and
the others entered the kitchen, they saw Mrs. Weasley rummaging anxiously
in the drawers — “I’ve got a quill here somewhere!” — and Mr. Weasley
bending over the fire, talking to —
Harry shut his eyes hard and opened them again to make sure that they
were working properly.
Amos Diggory’s head was sitting in the middle of the flames like a large,bearded egg. It was talking very fast, completely unperturbed by the sparks
flying around it and the flames licking its ears.

“Lots of homework?” said Hermione brightly, catching up with them.
“Professor Vector didn’t give

 any at all!”
“Well, bully for Professor Vector,” said Ron moodily.They reached the entrance hall, which was packed with people queuing for
dinner. They had just joined the end of the line, when a loud voice rang out
behind them.
“Weasley! Hey, Weasley!”
Harry, Ron, and Hermione turned. Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle were
standing there, each looking thoroughly pleased about something.
“What?” said Ron shortly.
“Your dad’s in the paper, Weasley!” said Malfoy, brandishing a copy of the
Daily Prophet
 and speaking very loudly, so that everyone in the packed
entrance hall could hear. “Listen to this!

And he knew by her tone that it was his mother and father this time: He
moved toward her, feeling as if something heavy were pressing on his chest,
the same sensation he had had right after Dumbledore had died, a grief that
had actually weighed on his heart and lungs.
The headstone was only two rows behind Kendra and Ariana’s. It was
made of white marble, just like Dumbledore’s tomb, and this made it easy to
read, as it seemed to shine in the dark. Harry did not need to kneel or even
approach very close to it to make out the words engraved upon it.

CHAPTER  ONE
THE BOY WHO LIVED
r. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say
that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much pening
it. “Brand-new wand. Fourteen inches, willow, containing one unicorn tail-
hair. And we’ve got all our books —” He pointed at a large bag under his
chair. “What about those 
Monster Books
, eh? The assistant nearly cried when
we said we wanted two.”
“What’s all that, Hermione?” Harry asked, pointing at not one but three
bulging bags in the chair next to her.
“Well, I’m taking more new subjects than you, aren’t I?” said Hermione.
“Those are my books for Arithmancy, Care of Magical Creatures, Divination,
Study of Ancient Runes, Muggle Studies —”
“What are you doing Muggle Studies for?” said Ron, rolling his eyes at
Harry. “You’re Muggle-born! Your mum and dad are Muggles! You already
know all about Muggles!”
“But it’ll be fascinating to study them from the Wizarding point of view,”
said Hermione earnestly.
“Are you planning to eat or sleep at all this year, Hermione?” asked Harry,
while Ron sniggered. Hermione ignored them.
“I’ve still got ten Galleons,” she said, checking her purse. “It’s my birthday
in said Ron, but Hermione told him to be quiet until she’d looked
something up, and started flicking frantically through the pages, muttering to
herself.
At last she found what she was looking for.
“I knew it! I 
knew
 it!”
“Are we allowed to speak yet?” said Ron grumpily. Hermione ignored him.
“Nicolas Flamel,” she whispered dramatically, “is the 
only known maker of
the Sorcerer’s Stone
!”
This didn’t have quite the effect she’d expected.
“The what?” said Harry and Ron.“Oh, 
honestly,
 don’t you two read? Look — read that, there.”
She pushed the book toward them, and Harry and Ron read:
The ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the
Sorcerer’s Stone, a legendary substance with astonishing powers.
The Stone will transform any metal into pure gold. It also produces
the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal.
There have been many reports of the Sorcerer’s Stone over the
centuries, but the only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr.
Nicolas Flamel, the noted alchemist and opera lover. tion. Some are going so far as to call Potter
“the Chosen One,” believing that the prophecy names him as the only
one who will be able to rid us of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.
The current whereabouts of the prophecy, if it exists, are unknown,
although (

A second newspaper lay beside the first. This one bore the headline:
SCRIMGEOUR SUCCEEDS FUDGE
Most of this front page was taken up with a large black-and-white picture
of a man with a lionlike mane of thick hair and a rather ravaged face. The
picture was moving — the man was waving at the ceiling.
Rufus Scrimgeour, previously Head of the Auror office in the
Department of Magical Law Enforcement, has succeeded Cornelius
Fudge as Minister of Magic. The appointment has largely been greeted
with enthusiasm by the Wizarding community, though rumors of a rift
between the new Minister and Albus Dumbledore, newly reinstated
Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, surfaced within hours of Scrimgeour
taking office.
Scrimgeour’s representatives admitted  d a few simple spells just for practice and it’s all worked for me.
Nobody in my family’s magic at all, it was ever such a surprise when I got my
letter, but I was ever so pleased, of course, I mean, it’s the very best school of
witchcraft there is, I’ve heard — I’ve learned all our course books by heart, of
course, I just hope it will be enough — I’m Hermione Granger, by the way,
who are you?”
She said all this very fast.
Harry looked at Ron, and was relieved to see by his stunned face that he
hadn’t learned all the course books by heart either.
“I’m Ron Weasley,” Ron muttered.
“Harry Potter,” said Harry.
“Are you really?” said Hermione. “I know all about you, of course — I got
a few extra books for background reading, and you’re in 
Modern Magical
History
 and 
The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts
 and 
Great Wizarding Events of
the Twentieth Century.”
“Am I?” said Harry, feeling dazed.
“Goodness, didn’t you know, I’d have found out everything I could if it
was me,” said Hermione. “Do either of you know what "
What platform do students use to board the Hogwarts Express?,Platform 9 3/4,"According to the passage, students use platform nine and three-quarters to board the Hogwarts Express."," ten. The only tricky part was doing this in an
unobtrusive way, so as to avoid attracting Muggle attention. They did it in
groups today; Harry, Ron, and Hermione (the most conspicuous, since they
were accompanied by Pigwidgeon and Crookshanks) went first; they leaned
casually against the barrier, chatting unconcernedly, and slid sideways
through it . . . and as they did so, platform nine and three-quarters
materialized in front of them.
The Hogwarts Express, a gleaming scarlet steam engine, was already there,
clouds of steam billowing from it, through which the many Hogwarts students
and parents on the platform appeared like dark ghosts. Pigwidgeon became
noisier than ever in response to the hooting of many owls through the mist.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione set off to find seats, and were soon stowing their
luggage in a compartment halfway along the train. They then hopped back
down onto the platform to say good-bye to Mrs. Weasley, Bill, and Charlie.
“I might be seeing you all sooner than you think,” said Char ough onto
platform nine and three quarters, where the Hogwarts Express stood belching
sooty steam over a platform packed with departing students and their families.Harry inhaled the familiar smell and felt his spirits soar. . . . He was really
going back. . . .
“I hope the others make it in time,” said Mrs. Weasley anxiously, staring
behind her at the wrought-iron arch spanning the platform, through which
new arrivals would come.
“Nice dog, Harry!” called a tall boy with dreadlocks.
“Thanks, Lee,” said Harry, grinning, as Sirius wagged his tail frantically.
“Oh good,” said Mrs. Weasley, sounding relieved, “here’s Alastor with the
luggage, look . . .”
A porter’s cap pulled low over his mismatched eyes, Moody came limping
through the archway pushing a cart full of their trunks.
“All okay,” he muttered to Mrs. Weasley and Tonks. “Don’t think we were
followed . . .”
Seconds later, Mr. Weasley emerged onto the platform with Ron and
Hermione. They had almost unloaded Moody’s luggage cart when Fred,
George, and Ginn  back to us.”
They looked around. People were still watching them, mainly because of
Hedwig’s continuing screeches.
“I think we’d better go and wait by the car,” said Harry. “We’re attracting
too much atten —”
“Harry!” said Ron, his eyes gleaming. “The car!”
“What about it?”
“We can fly the car to Hogwarts!”
“But I thought —”
“We’re stuck, right? And we’ve got to get to school, haven’t we? And even
underage wizards are allowed to use magic if it’s a real emergency, section
nineteen or something of the Restriction of Thingy —”
“But your mum and dad . . .” said Harry, pushing against the barrier again
in the vain hope that it would give way. “How will they get home?”
“They don’t need the car!” said Ron impatiently. “They know how toApparate! You know, just vanish and reappear at home! They only bother
with Floo powder and the car because we’re all underage and we’re not
allowed to Apparate yet. . . .”
Harry’s feeling of panic turned suddenly to excitement.
“Can you fly it?”
“No problem,” said Ron, wheeling his  and all too soon, the Hogwarts
Express was pulling in at platform nine and three-quarters. The usual
confusion and noise filled the corridors as the students began to disembark.Ron and Hermione struggled out past Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, carrying
their trunks. Harry, however, stayed put.
“Fred — George — wait a moment.”
The twins turned. Harry pulled open his trunk and drew out his Triwizard
winnings.
“Take it,” he said, and he thrust the sack into George’s hands.
“What?” said Fred, looking flabbergasted.
“Take it,” Harry repeated firmly. “I don’t want it.”
“You’re mental,” said George, trying to push it back at Harry.
“No, I’m not,” said Harry. “You take it, and get inventing. It’s for the joke
shop.”
“He 
is
 mental,” Fred said in an almost awed voice.
“Listen,” said Harry firmly. “If you don’t take it, I’m throwing it down the
drain. I don’t want it and I don’t need it. But I could do with a few laughs. We
could all do with a few laughs. I’ve got a feeling we’re going to need them
more than usual before  ture, so I’d recommend Divination. People say Muggle
Studies is a soft option, but I personally think wizards should have a thorough
understanding of the non-magical community, particularly if they’re thinking
of working in close contact with them — look at my father, he has to deal
with Muggle business all the time. My brother Charlie was always more of an
outdoor type, so he went for Care of Magical Creatures. Play to your
strengths, Harry.”
But the only thing Harry felt he was really good at was Quidditch. In the
end, he chose the same new subjects as Ron, feeling that if he was lousy at
them, at least he’d have someone friendly to help him.Gryffindor’s next Quidditch match would be against Hufflepuff. Wood was
insisting on team practices every night after dinner, so that Harry barely had
time for anything but Quidditch and homework. However, the training
sessions were getting better, or at least drier, and the evening before
Saturday’s match he went up to his dormitory to drop off his broomstick
feeling G ay
— how do you find Hogwarts? Do you feel you receive enough support from
the school management?”
“Oh, yes, Dumbledore’s excellent,” said Professor Grubbly-Plank heartily.
“No, I’m very happy with the way things are run, very happy indeed.”
Looking politely incredulous, Umbridge made a tiny note on her clipboard
and went on, “And what are you planning to cover with this class this year —
assuming, of course, that Professor Hagrid does not return?”
“Oh, I’ll take them through the creatures that most often come up in
O.W.L.,” said Professor Grubbly-Plank. “Not much left to do — they’vestudied unicorns and nifflers, I thought we’d cover porlocks and kneazles,
make sure they can recognize crups and knarls, you know . . .”
“Well, 
you
 seem to know what you’re doing, at any rate,” said Professor
Umbridge, making a very obvious tick on her clipboard. Harry did not like the
emphasis she put on 
“you”
 and liked it even less when she put her next
question to Goyle: “Now, I hear there have been injuries in this class  to the staff table. “Yer in
my firs’ ever lesson! Right after lunch! Bin up since five gettin’ everythin’
ready. . . . Hope it’s okay. . . . Me, a teacher . . . hones’ly. . . .”
He grinned broadly at them and headed off to the staff table, still swinging
the polecat.
“Wonder what he’s been getting ready?” said Ron, a note of anxiety in his
voice.
The hall was starting to empty as people headed off toward their first
lesson. Ron checked his course schedule.
“We’d better go, look, Divination’s at the top of North Tower. It’ll take us
ten minutes to get there. . . .”
They finished their breakfasts hastily, said good-bye to Fred and George,
and walked back through the hall. As they passed the Slytherin table, Malfoy
did yet another impression of a fainting fit. The shouts of laughter followed
Harry into the entrance hall.
The journey through the castle to North Tower was a long one. Two years
at Hogwarts hadn’t taught them everything about the castle, and they had
never been inside North Tower before.
“There’s — bed.
“Just trying to decide which ones to take with us,” said Hermione. “When
we’re looking for the Horcruxes.”
“Oh, of course,” said Ron, clapping a hand to his forehead. “I forgot we’ll
be hunting down Voldemort in a mobile library.”
“Ha ha,” said Hermione, looking down at 
Spellman’s Syllabary. 
“I
wonder . . . will we need to translate runes? It’s possible. . . . I think we’d
better take it, to be safe.”
She dropped the syllabary onto the larger of the two piles and picked up
Hogwarts: A History.
“Listen,” said Harry.
He had sat up straight. Ron and Hermione looked at him with similar
mixtures of resignation and defiance.
“I know you said after Dumbledore’s funeral that you wanted to come with
me,” Harry began.
“Here he goes,” Ron said to Hermione, rolling his eyes.
“As we knew he would,” she sighed, turning back to the books. “You
know, I think I 
will 
take 
Hogwarts: A History.
 Even if we’re not going backthere, I don’t think I’d feel right if I didn’t have it with —”
“Listen!” said Harry again.
“No, "
What is the name of Harry's godfather?,Sirius Black,"According to the text, Harry's godfather is Sirius Black, a convicted murderer who was a best friend of Harry's parents."," Harry bid him
and Hermione good-bye, then wheeled the trolley bearing his trunk and
Hedwig’s cage toward Uncle Vernon, who greeted him in his usual fashion.
“What’s that?” he snarled, staring at the envelope Harry was still clutching
in his hand. “If it’s another form for me to sign, you’ve got another —”
“It’s not,” said Harry cheerfully. “It’s a letter from my godfather.”
“Godfather?” spluttered Uncle Vernon. “You haven’t got a godfather!”
“Yes, I have,” said Harry brightly. “He was my mum and dad’s best friend.
He’s a convicted murderer, but he’s broken out of Wizard prison and he’s on
the run. He likes to keep in touch with me, though . . . keep up with my
news . . . check if I’m happy. . . .”
And, grinning broadly at the look of horror on Uncle Vernon’s face, Harry
set off toward the station exit, Hedwig rattling along in front of him, for what
looked like a much better summer than the last.

into his previously despised mother’s family — the woman whom, you will
remember, he had thought could not be a witch if she had succumbed to the
shameful human weakness of death.

from those who ran the orphanage had been his mother’s father’s name.
Finally, after painstaking research through old books of Wizarding families,
he discovered the existence of Slytherin’s surviving line. In the summer of his
sixteenth year, he left the orphanage to which he returned annually and set off
to find his Gaunt relatives. And now, Harry, if you will stand . . .”
Dumbledore rose, and Harry saw that he was again holding a small crystal
bottle filled with swirling, pearly memory.
“I was very lucky to collect this,” he said, as he poured the gleaming mass
into the Pensieve. “As you will understand when we have experienced it.
Shall we?”
Harry stepped up to the stone basin and bowed obediently until his face
sank through the surface of th get who I’ve got with me.”
“Tie that around the bars,” said Fred, throwing the end of a rope to Harry.
“If the Dursleys wake up, I’m dead,” said Harry as he tied the rope tightly
around a bar and Fred revved up the car.
“Don’t worry,” said Fred, “and stand back.”
Harry moved back into the shadows next to Hedwig, who seemed to have
realized how important this was and kept still and silent. The car revved
louder and louder and suddenly, with a crunching noise, the bars were pulled
clean out of the window as Fred drove straight up in the air. Harry ran back to
the window to see the bars dangling a few feet above the ground. Panting,
Ron hoisted them up into the car. Harry listened anxiously, but there was no
sound from the Dursleys’ bedroom.
When the bars were safely in the back seat with Ron, Fred reversed as close
as possible to Harry’s window.
“Get in,” Ron said.
“But all my Hogwarts stuff — my wand — my broomstick —”
“Where is it?”
“Locked in the cupboard under the stairs, and I can’t get out of this room
—” you please, Master Harry, and hands washed before dinner,”
croaked Kreacher, seizing the Invisibility Cloak and slouching off to hang iton a hook on the wall, beside a number of old-fashioned robes that had been
freshly laundered.
“What’s happened?” Ron asked apprehensively. He and Hermione had
been poring over a sheaf of scribbled notes and hand-drawn maps that littered
the end of the long kitchen table, but now they watched Harry as he strode
toward them and threw down the newspaper on top of their scattered
parchment.
A large picture of a familiar, hook-nosed, black-haired man stared up at
them all, beneath a headline that read:
SEVERUS SNAPE CONFIRMED AS HOGWARTS HEADMASTER
“No!” said Ron and Hermione loudly.
Hermione was quickest; she snatched up the newspaper and began to read
the accompanying story out loud.
“‘Severus Snape, long-standing Potions master at Hogwarts School of
Witchcraft and Wizardry, was today appointed headmaster in the most
important of several staffing changes at the ancient school.  that he had not been thinking about the sword
at all when he suggested they go to Godric’s Hollow. For him, the lure of the
village lay in his parents’ graves, the house where he had narrowly escaped
death, and in the person of Bathilda Bagshot.
“Remember what Muriel said?” he asked eventually.
“Who?”
“You know,” he hesitated: He did not want to say Ron’s name. “Ginny’s
great-aunt. At the wedding. The one who said you had skinny ankles.”
“Oh,” said Hermione. It was a sticky moment: Harry knew that she had
sensed Ron’s name in the offing. He rushed on:
“She said Bathilda Bagshot still lives in Godric’s Hollow.”
“Bathilda Bagshot,” murmured Hermione, running her index finger over
Bathilda’s embossed name on the front cover of 
A History of Magic.
 “Well, I
suppose —”
She gasped so dramatically that Harry’s insides turned over; he drew his
wand, looking around at the entrance, half expecting to see a hand forcing its
way through the entrance flap, but there was nothing there.
“What?” he said, half angry, half re tion. Some are going so far as to call Potter
“the Chosen One,” believing that the prophecy names him as the only
one who will be able to rid us of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.

Rufus Scrimgeour, previously Head of the Auror office in the

between the new Minister and Albus Dumbledore, newly reinstated
Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, surfaced within hours of Scrimgeour
taking office.
Scrimgeour’s representatives admitted  f Harry’s supporters against following Hagrid’s lead.
‘Support Harry Potter’ parties are unwise in the present climate.”
“Indeed they are, Romulus,” said Lee, “so we suggest that you continue to
show your devotion to the man with the lightning scar by listening to
Potterwatch
! And now let’s move to news concerning the wizard who is
proving just as elusive as Harry Potter. We like to refer to him as the Chief
Death Eater, and here to give his views on some of the more insane rumors
circulating about him, I’d like to introduce a new correspondent: Rodent.”“‘Rodent’?” 
said yet another familiar voice, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione
cried out together:
“Fred!”
“No — is it George?”
“It’s Fred, I think,” said Ron, leaning in closer, as whichever twin it was
said,
“I’m not being ‘Rodent,’ no way, I told you I wanted to be ‘Rapier’!”
“Oh, all right then. ‘Rapier,’ could you please give us your take on the
various stories we’ve been hearing about the Chief Death Eater?”
“Yes, River, I can,” said Fred. “As our listeners ? Did he wish to give you that sword, Potter, because he
believed, as do many, that you are the one destined to destroy He-Who-Must-
Not-Be-Named?”
“Interesting theory,” said Harry. “Has anyone ever tried sticking a sword in
Voldemort? Maybe the Ministry should put some people onto that, instead of
wasting their time stripping down Deluminators or covering up breakouts
from Azkaban. So is this what you’ve been doing, Minister, shut up in your
office, trying to break open a Snitch? People are dying — I was nearly one of
them — Voldemort chased me across three counties, he killed Mad-Eye
Moody, but there’s been no word about any of that from the Ministry, has
there? And you still expect us to cooperate with you!”
“You go too far!” shouted Scrimgeour, standing up; Harry jumped to his
feet too. Scrimgeour limped toward Harry and jabbed him hard in the chest
with the point of his wand: It singed a hole in Harry’s T-shirt like a lit
cigarette.
“Oi!” said Ron, jumping up and raising his own wand, but Harry said,
“No"
Who is the gamekeeper at Hogwarts?,Rubeus Hagrid,"According to the passage, Rubeus Hagrid is the Hogwarts gamekeeper.","s. One of Harry’s most prized
possessions was his Nimbus Two Thousand racing broom.
Harry put the leather case aside and picked up his last parcel. He
recognized the untidy scrawl on the brown paper at once: This was from
Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper. He tore off the top layer of paper and
glimpsed something green and leathery, but before he could unwrap it
properly, the parcel gave a strange quiver, and whatever was inside it snapped
loudly — as though it had jaws.
Harry froze. He knew that Hagrid would never send him anything
dangerous on purpose, but then, Hagrid didn’t have a normal person’s view of
what was dangerous. Hagrid had been known to befriend giant spiders, buy
vicious, three-headed dogs from men in pubs, and sneak illegal dragon eggs
into his cabin.
Harry poked the parcel nervously. It snapped loudly again. Harry reached
for the lamp on his bedside table, gripped it firmly in one hand, and raised it
over his head, ready to strike. Then he seized the rest of the wrapping paper in
his other ha unfolded it, and read it, with Ron,
Seamus, Dean, and Neville looking over his shoulder. It was an article topped
with a picture of Hagrid looking extremely shifty.
DUMBLEDORE’S GIANT MISTAKE
Albus Dumbledore, eccentric headmaster of Hogwarts School of
Witchcraft and Wizardry, has never been afraid to make
controversial staff appointments, 
writes Rita Skeeter, Special
Correspondent.
 In September of this year, he hired Alastor “Mad-
Eye” Moody, the notoriously jinx-happy ex-Auror, to teach Defense
Against the Dark Arts, a decision that caused many raised eyebrows
at the Ministry of Magic, given Moody’s well-known habit of
attacking anybody who makes a sudden movement in his presence.
Mad-Eye Moody, however, looks responsible and kindly when set
beside the part-human Dumbledore employs to teach Care ofMagical Creatures.
Rubeus Hagrid, who admits to being expelled from Hogwarts in
his third year, has enjoyed the position of gamekeeper at the school
ever since, a job secured for him by Dumbledore. Last year,
ho keeper duties on the grounds, and Professor Grubbly-Plank
continued to take the Care of Magical Creatures classes. Malfoy was gloating
at every possible opportunity.
“Missing your half-breed pal?” he kept whispering to Harry whenever there
was a teacher around, so that he was safe from Harry’s retaliation. “Missing
the elephant-man?”
There was a Hogsmeade visit halfway through January. Hermione was very
surprised that Harry was going to go.
“I just thought you’d want to take advantage of the common room being
quiet,” she said. “Really get to work on that egg.”
“Oh I — I reckon I’ve got a pretty good idea what it’s about now,” Harry
lied.
“Have you really?” said Hermione, looking impressed. “Well done!”
Harry’s insides gave a guilty squirm, but he ignored them. He still had five
weeks to work out that egg clue, after all, and that was ages . . . whereas if he
went into Hogsmeade, he might run into Hagrid, and get a chance to persuade
him to come back.
He, Ron, and Hermione left the castle together on Saturday  hose friends of Harry Potter’s who are
suffering for their allegiance?” Lee was saying.
“Well, as regular listeners will know, several of the more outspoken
supporters of Harry Potter have now been imprisoned, including Xenophilius
Lovegood, erstwhile editor of 
The Quibbler
,” said Lupin.
“At least he’s still alive!” muttered Ron.
“We have also heard within the last few hours that Rubeus Hagrid” — all
three of them gasped, and so nearly missed the rest of the sentence — “well-
known gamekeeper at Hogwarts School, has narrowly escaped arrest within
the grounds of Hogwarts, where he is rumored to have hosted a ‘Support
Harry Potter’ party in his house. However, Hagrid was not taken into custody,
and is, we believe, on the run.”
“I suppose it helps, when escaping from Death Eaters, if you’ve got a
sixteen-foot-high half brother?” asked Lee.
“It would tend to give you an edge,” agreed Lupin gravely. “May I just add
that while we here at 
Potterwatch

she must have attempted a Hair-Thickening Charm on herself and refused to
listen to the fourteen eyewitnesses who insisted that they had seen the
Slytherin Keeper, Miles Bletchley, hit her from behind with a jinx while she
worked in the library.
Harry felt optimistic about Gryffindor’s chances; they had, after all, never
lost to Malfoy’s team. Admittedly Ron was still not performing to Wood’s
standard, but he was working extremely hard to improve. His greatest
weakness was a tendency to lose confidence when he made a blunder; if he let
in one goal he became flustered and was therefore likely to miss more. On the
other hand, Harry had seen Ron make some truly spectacular saves when he
was on form: During one memorable practice, he had hung one-handed from
his broom and kicked the Quaffle so hard away from the goal hoop that it
soared the length of the pitch and through the center hoop at the other end.
The rest of the team felt this save compare eaters on each team
who carry clubs to beat the Bludgers away from their side. Fred and George
Weasley are the Gryffindor Beaters.”
“And what are the other balls for?” Colin asked, tripping down a couple of
steps because he was gazing open-mouthed at Harry.
“Well, the Quaffle — that’s the biggish red one — is the one that scores
goals. Three Chasers on each team throw the Quaffle to each other and try
and get it through the goalposts at the end of the pitch — they’re three long
poles with hoops on the end.”
“And the fourth ball —”
“— is the Golden Snitch,” said Harry, “and it’s very small, very fast, and
difficult to catch. But that’s what the Seeker’s got to do, because a game of
Quidditch doesn’t end until the Snitch has been caught. And whichever
team’s Seeker gets the Snitch earns his team an extra hundred and fifty
points.”“And 
you’re
 the Gryffindor Seeker, aren’t you?” said Colin in awe.
“Yes,” said Harry as they left the castle and started across the dew-
drenched grass. “And there’s the Keeper, too. lake, so the light’s all green.”
There was a short pause.
“Well, well, looks like we really ’ave caught a little Slytherin,” said
Scabior. “Good for you, Vernon, ’cause there ain’t a lot of Mudblood
Slytherins. Who’s your father?”
“He works at the Ministry,” Harry lied. He knew that his whole story would
collapse with the smallest investigation, but on the other hand, he only had
until his face regained its usual appearance before the game was up in any
case. “Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes.”
“You know what, Greyback,” said Scabior. “I think there 
is 
a Dudley in
there.”
Harry could barely breathe: Could luck, sheer luck, get them safely out of
this?
“Well, well,” said Greyback, and Harry could hear the tiniest note of
trepidation in that callous voice, and knew that Greyback was wondering
whether he had indeed just attacked and bound the son of a Ministry official.
Harry’s heart was pounding against the ropes around his ribs; he would not
have been surprised to know that Greyback could see se,” said Ron, but Harry cut him off.
“No, we’re in a hurry. Hagrid, I’ve got to ask you something. You knowthat night you won Norbert? What did the stranger you were playing cards
with look like?”
“Dunno,” said Hagrid casually, “he wouldn’ take his cloak off.”
He saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrows.
“It’s not that unusual, yeh get a lot o’ funny folk in the Hog’s Head —
that’s one o’ the pubs down in the village. Mighta bin a dragon dealer,
mightn’ he? I never saw his face, he kept his hood up.”
Harry sank down next to the bowl of peas.
“What did you talk to him about, Hagrid? Did you mention Hogwarts at
all?”
“Mighta come up,” said Hagrid, frowning as he tried to remember.
“Yeah . . . he asked what I did, an’ I told him I was gamekeeper here. . . . He
asked a bit about the sorta creatures I look after . . . so I told him . . . an’ I said
what I’d always really wanted was a dragon . . . an’ then . . . I can’ remember
too well, ’cause he kept buyin’ me drinks. . . . Let’s see . . . yeah"
What position does Harry play on his Quidditch team?,Seeker,"According to the text, Harry plays as a Seeker on his Quidditch team.","sed. Ron
doesn’t seem too happy about it.
Harry laughed as he put Hermione’s letter aside and picked up her present.
It was very heavy. Knowing Hermione, he was sure it would be a large book
full of very difficult spells — but it wasn’t. His heart gave a huge bound as he
ripped back the paper and saw a sleek black leather case, with silver words
stamped across it, reading 
Broomstick Servicing Kit
.
“Wow, Hermione!” Harry whispered, unzipping the case to look inside.
There was a large jar of Fleetwood’s High-Finish Handle Polish, a pair of
gleaming silver Tail-Twig Clippers, a tiny brass compass to clip on yourbroom for long journeys, and a 
Handbook of Do-It-Yourself Broomcare.
Apart from his friends, the thing that Harry missed most about Hogwarts
was Quidditch, the most popular sport in the magical world — highly
dangerous, very exciting, and played on broomsticks. Harry happened to be a
very good Quidditch player; he had been the youngest person in a century to
be picked for one of the Hogwarts House team on. At either end of the field were
three golden poles with hoops on the end. They reminded Harry of the little
plastic sticks Muggle children blew bubbles through, except that they were
fifty feet high.
Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry mounted his broomstick and
kicked off from the ground. What a feeling — he swooped in and out of the
goalposts and then sped up and down the field. The Nimbus Two Thousand
turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch.
“Hey, Potter, come down!”
Oliver Wood had arrived. He was carrying a large wooden crate under his
arm. Harry landed next to him.
“Very nice,” said Wood, his eyes glinting. “I see what McGonagall
meant . . . you really are a natural. I’m just going to teach you the rules this
evening, then you’ll be joining team practice three times a week.”
He opened the crate. Inside were four different-sized balls.
“Right,” said Wood. “Now, Quidditch is easy enough to understand, even if
it’s not too easy to play. There are seven players on each side. Three of  at’s your Quidditch team?” Ron asked.“Er — I don’t know any,” Harry confessed.
“What!” Ron looked dumbfounded. “Oh, you wait, it’s the best game in the
world —” And he was off, explaining all about the four balls and the
positions of the seven players, describing famous games he’d been to with his
brothers and the broomstick he’d like to get if he had the money. He was just
taking Harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door
slid open yet again, but it wasn’t Neville the toadless boy, or Hermione
Granger this time.
Three boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle one at once: It was
the pale boy from Madam Malkin’s robe shop. He was looking at Harry with
a lot more interest than he’d shown back in Diagon Alley.
“Is it true?” he said. “They’re saying all down the train that Harry Potter’s
in this compartment. So it’s you, is it?”
“Yes,” said Harry. He was looking at the other boys. Both of them were
thickset and looked extremely mean. Standing on either side of the pale boy,
they loo ibrary?”
“Because that’s what Hermione does,” said Ron, shrugging. “When in
doubt, go to the library.”
Harry stood, irresolute, trying to catch the voice again, but people were
now emerging from the Great Hall behind him, talking loudly, exiting through
the front doors on their way to the Quidditch pitch.
“You’d better get moving,” said Ron. “It’s nearly eleven — the match —”
Harry raced up to Gryffindor Tower, collected his Nimbus Two Thousand,
and joined the large crowd swarming across the grounds, but his mind was
still in the castle along with the bodiless voice, and as he pulled on his scarlet
robes in the locker room, his only comfort was that everyone was now outside
to watch the game.
The teams walked onto the field to tumultuous applause. Oliver Wood took
off for a warm-up flight around the goalposts; Madam Hooch released the
balls. The Hufflepuffs, who played in canary yellow, were standing in a
huddle, having a last-minute discussion of tactics.
Harry was just mounting his broom when Professor McGo is leg. He bent
down just in time to grab Crookshanks by the end of his bushy tail and drag
him outside.
“You know, I reckon Ron was right about you,” Harry told Crookshanks
suspiciously. “There are plenty of mice around this place — go and chase
them. Go on,” he added, nudging Crookshanks down the spiral staircase with
his foot. “Leave Scabbers alone.”
The noise of the storm was even louder in the common room. Harry knew
better than to think the match would be canceled; Quidditch matches weren’t
called off for trifles like thunderstorms. Nevertheless, he was starting to feel
very apprehensive. Wood had pointed out Cedric Diggory to him in the
corridor; Diggory was a fifth year and a lot bigger than Harry. Seekers were
usually light and speedy, but Diggory’s weight would be an advantage in this
weather because he was less likely to be blown off course.
Harry whiled away the hours until dawn in front of the fire, getting up
every now and then to stop Crookshanks from sneaking up the boys’ staircase
again. At l  He guards the goalposts. That’s
it, really.”
But Colin didn’t stop questioning Harry all the way down the sloping lawns
to the Quidditch field, and Harry only shook him off when he reached the
changing rooms; Colin called after him in a piping voice, “I’ll go and get a
good seat, Harry!” and hurried off to the stands.
The rest of the Gryffindor team were already in the changing room. Wood
was the only person who looked truly awake. Fred and George Weasley were
sitting, puffy-eyed and tousle-haired, next to fourth year Alicia Spinnet, who
seemed to be nodding off against the wall behind her. Her fellow Chasers,
Katie Bell and Angelina Johnson, were yawning side by side opposite them.
“There you are, Harry, what kept you?” said Wood briskly. “Now, I wanted
a quick talk with you all before we actually get onto the field, because I spent
the summer devising a whole new training program, which I really think will
make all the difference. . . .”
Wood was holding up a large diagram of a Quidditch field, on which we  in the first
Quidditch match of the previous year.
“Long walk, Arthur?” Cedric’s father asked.
“Not too bad,” said Mr. Weasley. “We live just on the other side of the
village there. You?”
“Had to get up at two, didn’t we, Ced? I tell you, I’ll be glad when he’s got
his Apparition test. Still . . . not complaining . . . Quidditch World Cup,wouldn’t miss it for a sackful of Galleons — and the tickets cost about that.
Mind you, looks like I got off easy. . . .” Amos Diggory peered good-
naturedly around at the three Weasley boys, Harry, Hermione, and Ginny.
“All these yours, Arthur?”
“Oh no, only the redheads,” said Mr. Weasley, pointing out his children.
“This is Hermione, friend of Ron’s — and Harry, another friend —”
“Merlin’s beard,” said Amos Diggory, his eyes widening. “Harry? Harry
Potter
?”
“Er — yeah,” said Harry.
Harry was used to people looking curiously at him when they met him,
used to the way their eyes moved at once to the lightning scar on his forehead,
but it always made him feel uncomfortable. ong last Harry thought it must be time for breakfast, so he headed
through the portrait hole alone.
“Stand and fight, you mangy cur!” yelled Sir Cadogan.
“Oh, shut up,” Harry yawned.
He revived a bit over a large bowl of porridge, and by the time he’d startedon toast, the rest of the team had turned up.
“It’s going to be a tough one,” said Wood, who wasn’t eating anything.
“Stop worrying, Oliver,” said Alicia soothingly, “we don’t mind a bit of
rain.”
But it was considerably more than a bit of rain. Such was the popularity of
Quidditch that the whole school turned out to watch the match as usual, but
they ran down the lawns toward the Quidditch field, heads bowed against the
ferocious wind, umbrellas being whipped out of their hands as they went. Just
before he entered the locker room, Harry saw Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle,
laughing and pointing at him from under an enormous umbrella on their way
to the stadium.
The team changed into their scarlet robes and waited for Wood’s usual pre-
match pep talk, but it di"

Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington at your service. Resident ghost of
Gryffindor Tower.”
“I know who you are!” said Ron suddenly. “My brothers told me about you
— you’re Nearly Headless Nick!”
“I would 
prefer
 you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy —” the ghost began
stiffly, but sandy-haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted.
“
Nearly
 Headless? How can you be 
nearly
 headless?”
Sir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little chat wasn’t going at
all the way he wanted.
“Like 
this,
” he said irritably. He seized his left ear and pulled. His whole
head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge.
Someone had obviously tried to behead him, but not done it properly.
Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces, Nearly Headless Nick
flipped his head back onto his neck, coughed, and said, “So — new
Gryffindors! I hope you’re going to help us win the House Championship this
year? Gryffindors have never gone so long without winning. Slytherins havegot the Cup six years ings at friends from other Houses, eyeing one another’s new haircuts and
robes. Again Harry noticed people putting their heads together to whisper as
he passed; he gritted his teeth and tried to act as though he neither noticed nor
cared.
Luna drifted away from them at the Ravenclaw table. The moment they
reached Gryffindor’s, Ginny was hailed by some fellow fourth years and left
to sit with them; Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Neville found seats together
about halfway down the table between Nearly Headless Nick, the Gryffindor
House ghost, and Parvati Patil and Lavender Brown, the last two of whom
gave Harry airy, overly friendly greetings that made him quite sure they had
stopped talking about him a split second before. He had more important
things to worry about, however: He was looking over the students’ heads to
the staff table that ran along the top wall of the Hall.
“He’s not there.”
Ron and Hermione scanned the staff table too, though there was no real
need; Hagrid’s size made him instantly obvious in any ching the
bottom of the stairs, where Nearly Headless Nick, ghost of Gryffindor Tower,
stood waiting for him.
“Harry! My dear boy!”Nick made to grasp Harry’s hands with both of his own: Harry’s felt as
though they had been thrust into icy water.
“Nick, you’ve got to help me. Who’s the ghost of Ravenclaw Tower?”
Nearly Headless Nick looked surprised and a little offended.
“The Gray Lady, of course; but if it is ghostly services you require — ?”
“It’s got to be her — d’you know where she is?”
“Let’s see. . . .”
Nick’s head wobbled a little on his ruff as he turned hither and thither,
peering over the heads of the swarming students.
“That’s her over there, Harry, the young woman with the long hair.”
Harry looked in the direction of Nick’s transparent, pointing finger and saw
a tall ghost who caught sight of Harry looking at her, raised her eyebrows, and
drifted away through a solid wall.
Harry ran after her. Once through the door of the corridor into which she
had disappeared, he saw her at the very end of the p the wizard’s bidding. A ghost, as I trust
that you are all aware by now, is the imprint of a departed soul left upon the
earth . . . and of course, as Potter so wisely tells us, 
transparent.
”
“Well, what Harry said is the most useful if we’re trying to tell them apart!”
said Ron. “When we come face-to-face with one down a dark alley, we’re
going to be having a shufti to see if it’s solid, aren’t we, we’re not going to be
asking, ‘Excuse me, are you the imprint of a departed soul?’”
There was a ripple of laughter, instantly quelled by the look Snape gave the
class.
“Another ten points from Gryffindor,” said Snape. “I would expect nothing
more sophisticated from you, Ronald Weasley, the boy so solid he cannot
Apparate half an inch across a room.”
“No!”
 whispered Hermione, grabbing Harry’s arm as he opened his mouth
furiously. “There’s no point, you’ll just end up in detention again, leave it!”
“Now open your books to page two hundred and thirteen,” said Snape,
smirking a little, “and read the first two parag ing animatedly to tiny little Professor Flitwick, the
Charms teacher. Harry moved his eyes along the table, to the place where
Snape sat. Was he imagining it, or were Snape’s eyes flickering toward Lupin
more often than was natural?
The feast finished with an entertainment provided by the Hogwarts ghosts.
They popped out of the walls and tables to do a bit of formation gliding;
Nearly Headless Nick, the Gryffindor ghost, had a great success with a
reenactment of his own botched beheading.
It had been such a pleasant evening that Harry’s good mood couldn’t even
be spoiled by Malfoy, who shouted through the crowd as they all left the hall,
“The dementors send their love, Potter!”Harry, Ron, and Hermione followed the rest of the Gryffindors along the
usual path to Gryffindor Tower, but when they reached the corridor that ended
with the portrait of the Fat Lady, they found it jammed with students.
“Why isn’t anyone going in?” said Ron curiously.
Harry peered over the heads in front of him. The portrait seemed to  lease wake up,” Harry muttered desperately, shaking her. Ginny’s
head lolled hopelessly from side to side.
“She won’t wake,” said a soft voice.
Harry jumped and spun around on his knees.
A tall, black-haired boy was leaning against the nearest pillar, watching. He
was strangely blurred around the edges, as though Harry were looking at him
through a misted window. But there was no mistaking him —
“Tom — 
Tom Riddle
?”
Riddle nodded, not taking his eyes off Harry’s face.
“What d’you mean, she won’t wake?” Harry said desperately. “She’s not —
she’s not — ?”
“She’s still alive,” said Riddle. “But only just.”
Harry stared at him. Tom Riddle had been at Hogwarts fifty years ago, yet
here he stood, a weird, misty light shining about him, not a day older than
sixteen.
“Are you a ghost?” Harry said uncertainly.
“A memory,” said Riddle quietly. “Preserved in a diary for fifty years.”
He pointed toward the floor near the statue’s giant toes. Lying open there
was the little black diary Harry had found in Moaning Myrtle’s  in a row! The Bloody Baron’s becoming almost
unbearable — he’s the Slytherin ghost.”
Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting
there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained with silver
blood. He was right next to Malfoy who, Harry was pleased to see, didn’t
look too pleased with the seating arrangements.
“How did he get covered in blood?” asked Seamus with great interest.
“I’ve never asked,” said Nearly Headless Nick delicately.
When everyone had eaten as much as they could, the remains of the food
faded from the plates, leaving them sparkling clean as before. A moment later
the desserts appeared. Blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of,
apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate éclairs and jam doughnuts, trifle,
strawberries, Jell-O, rice pudding . . .
As Harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk turned to their families.
“I’m half-and-half,” said Seamus. “Me dad’s a Muggle. Mum didn’t tell
him she was a witch ’til after they were married. B ently, when Nick continued to say nothing.
Nearly Headless Nick hesitated, then said, “Not everyone can come back as
a ghost.”
“What d’you mean?” said Harry quickly.
“Only . . . only wizards.”
“Oh,” said Harry, and he almost laughed with relief. “Well, that’s okaythen, the person I’m asking about is a wizard. So he can come back, right?”
Nick turned away from the window and looked mournfully at Harry. “He
won’t come back.”
“Who?”
“Sirius Black,” said Nick.
“But you did!” said Harry angrily. “You came back — you’re dead and you
didn’t disappear —”
“Wizards can leave an imprint of themselves upon the earth, to walk palely
where their living selves once trod,” said Nick miserably. “But very few
wizards choose that path.”
“Why not?” said Harry. “Anyway — it doesn’t matter 
— Sirius won’t care
if it’s unusual, he’ll come back, I know he will!”
And so strong was his belief that Harry actually turned his head to check
the door, sure, for a split second, that he was going to see Sirius, pearly white
and transparent b"

“C’mon, let’s go. If we hurry we’ll be able to follow the Hogwarts Express
—”
And they marched off through the crowd of curious Muggles, out of the
station and back onto the side road where the old Ford Anglia was parked.
Ron unlocked the cavernous trunk with a series of taps from his wand.
They heaved their luggage back in, put Hedwig on the back seat, and got into
the front.
“Check that no one’s watching,” said Ron, starting the ignition with another
tap of his wand. Harry stuck his head out of the window: Traffic was
rumbling along the main road ahead, but their street was empty.
“Okay,” he said.
Ron pressed a tiny silver button on the dashboard. The car around them
vanished — and so did they. Harry could feel the seat vibrating beneath him,
hear the engine, feel his hands on his knees and his glasses on his nose, but
for all he could see, he had become a pair of eyeballs, floating a few feet
above the ground in a dingy street full of parked cars.
“Let’s go,” said Ron’s voi  back to us.”
They looked around. People were still watching them, mainly because of
Hedwig’s continuing screeches.
“I think we’d better go and wait by the car,” said Harry. “We’re attracting
too much atten —”
“Harry!” said Ron, his eyes gleaming. “The car!”
“What about it?”
“We can fly the car to Hogwarts!”
“But I thought —”
“We’re stuck, right? And we’ve got to get to school, haven’t we? And even
underage wizards are allowed to use magic if it’s a real emergency, section
nineteen or something of the Restriction of Thingy —”
“But your mum and dad . . .” said Harry, pushing against the barrier again
in the vain hope that it would give way. “How will they get home?”
“They don’t need the car!” said Ron impatiently. “They know how toApparate! You know, just vanish and reappear at home! They only bother
with Floo powder and the car because we’re all underage and we’re not
allowed to Apparate yet. . . .”
Harry’s feeling of panic turned suddenly to excitement.
“Can you fly it?”
“No problem,” said Ron, wheeling his   are those horse things?” Harry said, as he, Ron, and
Luna made for the carriage in which Hermione and Ginny were already
sitting.“What horse things?”
“The horse things pulling the carriages!” said Harry impatiently; they were,
after all, about three feet from the nearest one; it was watching them with
empty white eyes. Ron, however, gave Harry a perplexed look.
“What are you talking about?”
“I’m talking about — look!”
Harry grabbed Ron’s arm and wheeled him about so that he was face-to-
face with the winged horse. Ron stared straight at it for a second, then looked
back at Harry.
“What am I supposed to be looking at?”
“At the — there, between the shafts! Harnessed to the coach! It’s right
there in front —”
But as Ron continued to look bemused, a strange thought occurred to
Harry.
“Can’t . . . can’t you see them?”
“See 
what
?”
“Can’t you see what’s pulling the carriages?”
Ron looked seriously alarmed now.
“Are you feeling all right, Harry?”
“I . . . yeah . . .”
Harry felt utterly bewildered. The horse was th get who I’ve got with me.”
“Tie that around the bars,” said Fred, throwing the end of a rope to Harry.
“If the Dursleys wake up, I’m dead,” said Harry as he tied the rope tightly
around a bar and Fred revved up the car.
“Don’t worry,” said Fred, “and stand back.”
Harry moved back into the shadows next to Hedwig, who seemed to have
realized how important this was and kept still and silent. The car revved
louder and louder and suddenly, with a crunching noise, the bars were pulled
clean out of the window as Fred drove straight up in the air. Harry ran back to
the window to see the bars dangling a few feet above the ground. Panting,
Ron hoisted them up into the car. Harry listened anxiously, but there was no
sound from the Dursleys’ bedroom.
When the bars were safely in the back seat with Ron, Fred reversed as close
as possible to Harry’s window.
“Get in,” Ron said.
“But all my Hogwarts stuff — my wand — my broomstick —”
“Where is it?”
“Locked in the cupboard under the stairs, and I can’t get out of this room
—” ? Go and fetch him, at once!”
Filch evidently thought Professor McGonagall had taken leave of her
senses, but hobbled away, hunch-shouldered, muttering under his breath.
“And now — 
Piertotum Locomotor!
” cried Professor McGonagall.
And all along the corridor the statues and suits of armor jumped down from
their plinths, and from the echoing crashes from the floors above and below,
Harry knew that their fellows throughout the castle had done the same.
“Hogwarts is threatened!” shouted Professor McGonagall. “Man the
boundaries, protect us, do your duty to our school!”
Clattering and yelling, the horde of moving statues stampeded past Harry:some of them smaller, others larger, than life. There were animals too, and the
clanking suits of armor brandished swords and spiked balls on chains.
“Now, Potter,” said McGonagall, “you and Miss Lovegood had better
return to your friends and bring them to the Great Hall — I shall rouse the
other Gryffindors.”
They parted at the top of the next staircase, Harry and Luna runn s before you
can say ‘Quidditch.’ Come on, dear.”
Neville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off with Madam
Hooch, who had her arm around him.
No sooner were they out of earshot than Malfoy burst into laughter.
“Did you see his face, the great lump?”
The other Slytherins joined in.
“Shut up, Malfoy,” snapped Parvati Patil.“Ooh, sticking up for Longbottom?” said Pansy Parkinson, a hard-faced
Slytherin girl. “Never thought 
you’d
 like fat little crybabies, Parvati.”
“Look!” said Malfoy, darting forward and snatching something out of the
grass. “It’s that stupid thing Longbottom’s gran sent him.”
The Remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up.
“Give that here, Malfoy,” said Harry quietly. Everyone stopped talking to
watch.
Malfoy smiled nastily.
“I think I’ll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find — how about — up
a tree?”
“Give it 
here
!” Harry yelled, but Malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick and
taken off. He hadn’t been lying, he 
could
 fly well. Hovering level with the
topmost  s. One of Harry’s most prized
possessions was his Nimbus Two Thousand racing broom.
Harry put the leather case aside and picked up his last parcel. He
recognized the untidy scrawl on the brown paper at once: This was from
Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper. He tore off the top layer of paper and
glimpsed something green and leathery, but before he could unwrap it
properly, the parcel gave a strange quiver, and whatever was inside it snapped
loudly — as though it had jaws.
Harry froze. He knew that Hagrid would never send him anything
dangerous on purpose, but then, Hagrid didn’t have a normal person’s view of
what was dangerous. Hagrid had been known to befriend giant spiders, buy
vicious, three-headed dogs from men in pubs, and sneak illegal dragon eggs
into his cabin.
Harry poked the parcel nervously. It snapped loudly again. Harry reached
for the lamp on his bedside table, gripped it firmly in one hand, and raised it
over his head, ready to strike. Then he seized the rest of the wrapping paper in
his other ha ,
signed a fragment of parchment for Ron.
The weather could not have been more different on the journey back to King’s
Cross than it had been on their way to Hogwarts the previous September.
There wasn’t a single cloud in the sky. Harry, Ron, and Hermione had
managed to get a compartment to themselves. Pigwidgeon was once again
hidden under Ron’s dress robes to stop him from hooting continually; Hedwig
was dozing, her head under her wing, and Crookshanks was curled up in a
spare seat like a large, furry ginger cushion. Harry, Ron, and Hermione talked
more fully and freely than they had all week as the train sped them southward.
Harry felt as though Dumbledore’s speech at the Leaving Feast had unblocked
him, somehow. It was less painful to discuss what had happened now. They
broke off their conversation about what action Dumbledore might be taking,
even now, to stop Voldemort only when the lunch trolley arrived.
When Hermione returned from the trolley and put her money back into her
schoolbag, she dislodged a "

to a house-elf!”
“Yeah, we don’t need to hear about you being in love with Malfoy,” Harry
told Kreacher. “Let’s fast forward to where he’s actually been going.”
Kreacher bowed again, looking furious, and then said, “Master Malfoy eats
in the Great Hall, he sleeps in a dormitory in the dungeons, he attends his
classes in a variety of —”
“Dobby, you tell me,” said Harry, cutting across Kreacher. “Has he been

he is still keen to avoid detection. He has been making regular visits to the

“Must be, it’s not a very common name, is it?” said Harry. “Why?”
“I’ve heard Dad talking about him,” said George. “He was a big supporter
of You-Know-Who.”
“And when You-Know-Who disappeared,” said Fred, craning around to
look at Harry, “Lucius Malfoy came back saying he’d never meant any of it.
Load of dung — Dad reckons he was right in You-Know-Who’s inner circle.”
Harry had heard these rumors about Malfoy’s family before, and they
didn’t surprise him at all. Malfoy made Dudley Dursley look like a kind,
thoughtful, and sensitive boy.
“I don’t know whether the Malfoys own a house-elf. . . .” said Harry.
“Well, whoever owns him will be an old Wizarding family, and they’ll be
rich,” said Fred.
“Yeah, Mum’s always wishing we had a house-elf to do the ironing,” said
George. “But all we’ve got is a lousy old ghoul in the attic and gnomes all

“You’ve lost me my servant, boy!”
But Dobby shouted, “You shall not harm Harry Potter!”
There was a loud bang, and Mr. Malfoy was thrown backward. He crashed
down the stairs, three at a time, landing in a crumpled heap on the landingbelow. He got up, his face livid, and pulled out his wand, but Dobby raised a
long, threatening finger.
“You shall go now,” he said fiercely, pointing down at Mr. Malfoy. “You
shall not touch Harry Potter. You shall go now.”
Lucius Malfoy had no choice. With a last, incensed stare at the pair of
them, he swung his cloak around him and hurried out of sight.
“Harry Potter freed Dobby!” said the elf shrilly, gazing up at Harry,
moonlight from the nearest window reflected in his orb-like eyes. “Harry
Potter set Dobby free!”
“Least I could do, Dobby,” said Harry, grinning. “Just promise never to try
and save my life again.”
The elf’s ugly brown face split suddenly into a wide, toothy smile.
“I’ve just got one question, Dobby,” said H “But most wizards
doesn’t want a house-elf who wants paying, miss. ‘That’s not the point of a
house-elf,’ they says, and they slammed the door in Dobby’s face! Dobby
likes work, but he wants to wear clothes and he wants to be paid, Harry
Potter. . . . Dobby likes being free!”
The Hogwarts house-elves had now started edging away from Dobby, as
though he were carrying something contagious. Winky, however, remained
where she was, though there was a definite increase in the volume of her
crying.
“And then, Harry Potter, Dobby goes to visit Winky, and finds out Winky
has been freed too, sir!” said Dobby delightedly.
At this, Winky flung herself forward off her stool and lay facedown on theflagged stone floor, beating her tiny fists upon it and positively screaming
with misery. Hermione hastily dropped down to her knees beside her and tried
to comfort her, but nothing she said made the slightest difference. Dobby
continued with his story, shouting shrilly over Winky’s screeches.
“And then Dobby had the idea, Harry  ken up with a particularly loud
screech and was beating her wings wildly against the bars of her cage.“Dobby had to punish himself, sir,” said the elf, who had gone slightly
cross-eyed. “Dobby almost spoke ill of his family, sir. . . .”
“Your family?”
“The wizard family Dobby serves, sir. . . . Dobby is a house-elf — bound to
serve one house and one family forever. . . .”
“Do they know you’re here?” asked Harry curiously.
Dobby shuddered.
“Oh, no, sir, no . . . Dobby will have to punish himself most grievously for
coming to see you, sir. Dobby will have to shut his ears in the oven door for
this. If they ever knew, sir —”
“But won’t they notice if you shut your ears in the oven door?”
“Dobby doubts it, sir. Dobby is always having to punish himself for
something, sir. They lets Dobby get on with it, sir. Sometimes they reminds
me to do extra punishments. . . .”
“But why don’t you leave? Escape?”
“A house-elf must be set free, sir. And the family will never set Dobby
free . . . Dobby will serve the family until  large tears out of
his enormous eyes.
“You saved my life with that gillyweed, Dobby, you really did,” said Harry.
“No chance of more of those eclairs, is there?” said Ron, who was looking
around at the beaming and bowing house-elves.
“You’ve just had breakfast!” said Hermione irritably, but a great silver
platter of eclairs was already zooming toward them, supported by four elves.
“We should get some stuff to send up to Snuffles,” Harry muttered.
“Good idea,” said Ron. “Give Pig something to do. You couldn’t give us abit of extra food, could you?” he said to the surrounding elves, and they
bowed delightedly and hurried off to get some more.
“Dobby, where’s Winky?” said Hermione, who was looking around.
“Winky is over there by the fire, miss,” said Dobby quietly, his ears
drooping slightly.
“Oh dear,” said Hermione as she spotted Winky.
Harry looked over at the fireplace too. Winky was sitting on the same stool
as last time, but she had allowed herself to become so filthy that she was not
immediately distingu alfoy, what a pleasure to see you again,” said Mr. Borgin in a voice
as oily as his hair. “Delighted — and young Master Malfoy, too — charmed.
How may I be of assistance? I must show you, just in today, and very
reasonably priced —”
“I’m not buying today, Mr. Borgin, but selling,” said Mr. Malfoy.
“Selling?” The smile faded slightly from Mr. Borgin’s face.
“You have heard, of course, that the Ministry is conducting more raids,”
said Mr. Malfoy, taking a roll of parchment from his inside pocket and
unraveling it for Mr. Borgin to read. “I have a few — ah — items at home that
might embarrass me, if the Ministry were to call. . . .”
Mr. Borgin fixed a pair of pince-nez to his nose and looked down the list.
“The Ministry wouldn’t presume to trouble you, sir, surely?”
Mr. Malfoy’s lip curled.
“I have not been visited yet. The name Malfoy still commands a certain
respect, yet the Ministry grows ever more meddlesome. There are rumors
about a new Muggle Protection Act — no doubt that flea-bitten, Muggle-
loving fool  h showing apicture of Harry’s face and bearing the legend HAVE A VERY HARRY
CHRISTMAS!
Harry had only just managed to get the last of them down before the door
creaked open and Luna Lovegood entered, looking dreamy as always.
“Hello,” she said vaguely, looking around at what remained of the
decorations. “These are nice, did you put them up?”
“No,” said Harry, “it was Dobby the house-elf.”
“Mistletoe,” said Luna dreamily, pointing at a large clump of white berries
placed almost over Harry’s head. He jumped out from under it. “Good
thinking,” said Luna very seriously. “It’s often infested with nargles.”
Harry was saved the necessity of asking what nargles were by the arrival of
Angelina, Katie, and Alicia. All three of them were breathless and looked
very cold.
“Well,” said Angelina dully, pulling off her cloak and throwing it into a
corner, “we’ve replaced you.”
“Replaced me?” said Harry blankly.
“You and Fred and George,” she said impatiently. “We’ve got another
Seeker!”
“Who?” said Harry quickly.
“Ginny Weas"
Who is the Half-Blood Prince?,Severus Snape,"According to the text, the Half-Blood Prince is someone who is being discussed by Harry, Hermione, and Lupin. However, it is not clear who the Half-Blood Prince is, as Lupin does not recognize the name and Harry does not reveal the identity of the person.","rewolves deserve blood, that we ought to
revenge ourselves on normal people.”
“But you are normal!” said Harry fiercely. “You’ve just got a — a problem
—”
Lupin burst out laughing. “Sometimes you remind me a lot of James. He
called it my ‘furry little problem’ in company. Many people were under the
impression that I owned a badly behaved rabbit.”
He accepted a glass of eggnog from Mr. Weasley with a word of thanks,
looking slightly more cheerful. Harry, meanwhile, felt a rush of excitement:
This last mention of his father had reminded him that there was something he
had been looking forward to asking Lupin.
“Have you ever heard of someone called the Half-Blood Prince?”
“The Half-Blood what?”
“Prince,” said Harry, watching him closely for signs of recognition.
“There are no Wizarding princes,” said Lupin, now smiling. “Is this a title
you’re thinking of adopting? I should have thought being ‘the Chosen One’
would be enough.”
“It’s nothing to do with me!” said Harry indignantly. “The Half-Blood
Prince is someon from the Half-Blood Prince than Snape or Slughorn have taught
me in —”
“I’m not talking about your stupid so-called Prince,” said Hermione, giving
his book a nasty look as though it had been rude to her. “I’m talking about
earlier. I went into the girls’ bathroom just before I came in here and there
were about a dozen girls in there, including that Romilda Vane, trying to
decide how to slip you a love potion. They’re all hoping they’re going to get
you to take them to Slughorn’s party, and they all seem to have bought Fred
and George’s love potions, which I’m afraid to say probably work —”
“Why didn’t you confiscate them then?” demanded Harry. It seemed
extraordinary that Hermione’s mania for upholding rules could have
abandoned her at this crucial juncture.
“They didn’t have the potions with them in the bathroom,” said Hermione
scornfully. “They were just discussing tactics. As I doubt whether even the
Half-Blood Prince
” — she gave the book another nasty look — 
“
could dream
up an antidote for a dozen diff ,” she added, as Harry and Ron rolled their eyes, “because I’m
starting to think this Prince character was a bit dodgy.”
Both Harry and Ron shouted her down at once.
“It was a laugh!” said Ron, upending a ketchup bottle over his sausages.
“Just a laugh, Hermione, that’s all!”
“Dangling people upside down by the ankle?” said Hermione. “Who puts
their time and energy into making up spells like that?”
“Fred and George,” said Ron, shrugging, “it’s their kind of thing. And, er
—”
“My dad,” said Harry. He had only just remembered.
“What?” said Ron and Hermione together.
“My dad used this spell,” said Harry. “I — Lupin told me.”
This last part was not true; in fact, Harry had seen his father use the spell
on Snape, but he had never told Ron and Hermione about that particular
excursion into the Pensieve. Now, however, a wonderful possibility occurred
to him. Could the Half-Blood Prince possibly be — ?
“Maybe your dad did use it, Harry,” said Hermione, “but he’s not the only
one. We’ve seen a whole bunch of people use h the picture
belonged; it was a rather dull story about interschool competitions.
“Her name was Eileen Prince. 
Prince,
 Harry.”
They looked at each other, and Harry realized what Hermione was trying to
say. He burst out laughing.
“No way.”
“What?”
“You think 
she
 was the Half-Blood . . . ? Oh, come on.”
“Well, why not? Harry, there aren’t any real princes in the Wizarding
world! It’s either a nickname, a made-up title somebody’s given themselves,
or it could be their actual name, couldn’t it? No, listen! If, say, her father wasa wizard whose surname was Prince, and her mother was a Muggle, then that
would make her a ‘half-blood Prince’!”
“Yeah, very ingenious, Hermione . . .”
“But it would! Maybe she was proud of being half a Prince!”
“Listen, Hermione, I can tell it’s not a girl. I can just tell.”
“The truth is that you don’t think a girl would have been clever enough,”
said Hermione angrily.
“How can I have hung round with you for five years and not think girls are
clever?” said Harry, stung by this. “It self an impressive new
name — 
Lord
 Voldemort — the Half-Blood 
Prince —
 how could Dumbledore
have missed — ?”
He broke off, looking out the window. He could not stop himself dwelling
upon Dumbledore’s inexcusable trust in Snape . . . but as Hermione had just
inadvertently reminded him, he, Harry, had been taken in just the same. . . . Inspite of the increasing nastiness of those scribbled spells, he had refused to
believe ill of the boy who had been so clever, who had helped him so
much. . . .
Helped him
 . . . it was an almost unendurable thought now.
“I still don’t get why he didn’t turn you in for using that book,” said Ron.
“He must’ve known where you were getting it all from.”
“He knew,” said Harry bitterly. “He knew when I used Sectumsempra. He
didn’t really need Legilimency. . . . He might even have known before then,
with Slughorn talking about how brilliant I was at Potions. . . . Shouldn’t have
left his old book in the bottom of that cupboard, should he?”
“But why didn’t he turn you in?”
“I don’t  about that
now?”
“No — no — Harry, I didn’t mean that!” she said hastily, looking around to
check that they were not being overheard. “It’s just that I was right about
Eileen Prince once owning the book. You see . . . she was Snape’s mother!”
“I thought she wasn’t much of a looker,” said Ron. Hermione ignored him.
“I was going through the rest of the old 
Prophets
 and there was a tiny
announcement about Eileen Prince marrying a man called Tobias Snape, and
then later an announcement saying that she’d given birth to a —”
“— murderer,” spat Harry.
“Well . . . yes,” said Hermione. “So . . . I was sort of right. Snape must have
been proud of being ‘half a Prince,’ you see? Tobias Snape was a Muggle
from what it said in the 
Prophet.
”
“Yeah, that fits,” said Harry. “He’d play up the pure-blood side so he could
get in with Lucius Malfoy and the rest of them. . . . He’s just like Voldemort.
Pure-blood mother, Muggle father . . . ashamed of his parentage, trying to
make himself feared using the Dark Arts, gave him ave half a mind to leave now!”
“Empty threat, Karkaroff,” growled a voice from near the door. “You can’t
leave your champion now. He’s got to compete. They’ve all got to compete.
Binding magical contract, like Dumbledore said. Convenient, eh?”
Moody had just entered the room. He limped toward the fire, and with
every right step he took, there was a loud 
clunk.
“Convenient?” said Karkaroff. “I’m afraid I don’t understand you, Moody.”
Harry could tell he was trying to sound disdainful, as though what Moody
was saying was barely worth his notice, but his hands gave him away; they
had balled themselves into fists.
“Don’t you?” said Moody quietly. “It’s very simple, Karkaroff. Someone
put Potter’s name in that goblet knowing he’d have to compete if it came
out.”
“Evidently, someone ’oo wished to give ’Ogwarts two bites at ze apple!”
said Madame Maxime.
“I quite agree, Madame Maxime,” said Karkaroff, bowing to her. “I shall be
lodging complaints with the Ministry of Magic 
and
 the International
Confederation of W raid,” said Dumbledore slowly, looking as though every word cost
him a great effort, “that there is no doubt that it 
is
 you.”
“But you said — Neville was born at the end of July too — and his mum
and dad —”
“You are forgetting the next part of the prophecy, the final identifying
feature of the boy who could vanquish Voldemort. . . . Voldemort himself
would ‘mark him as his equal.’ And so he did, Harry. He chose you, not
Neville. He gave you the scar that has proved both blessing and curse.”
“But he might have chosen wrong!” said Harry. “He might have marked the
wrong person!”
“He chose the boy he thought most likely to be a danger to him,” said
Dumbledore. “And notice this, Harry. He chose, not the pureblood (which,
according to his creed, is the only kind of wizard worth being or knowing),
but the half-blood, like himself. He saw himself in you before he had ever
seen you, and in marking you with that scar, he did not kill you, as he
intended, but gave you powers, and a future, which have fitted you to esc"
What is the spell to summon objects?,Accio,The spell to summon objects is Accio.,", from which Harry retrieved it with a Summoning Charm.
Glancing around he thought he had been right to suggest that they practice the
basics first; there was a lot of shoddy spellwork going on; many people were
not succeeding in disarming their opponents at all, but merely causing them to
jump backward a few paces or wince as the feeble spell whooshed over them.“Expelliarmus!” 
said Neville, and Harry, caught unawares, felt his wand
fly out of his hand.
“I DID IT!” said Neville gleefully. “I’ve never done it before — I DID IT!”
“Good one!” said Harry encouragingly, deciding not to point out that in a
real duel situation Neville’s opponent was unlikely to be staring in the
opposite direction with his wand held loosely at his side. “Listen, Neville, can
you take it in turns to practice with Ron and Hermione for a couple of minutes
so I can walk around and see how the rest are doing?”
Harry moved off into the middle of the room. Something very odd was
happening to Zacharias Smith; every time he opened his mouth e crystal ball.
“Good day, my dear,” she said softly. “If you would kindly gaze into the
Orb. . . . Take your time, now . . . then tell me what you see within it. . . .”
Harry bent over the crystal ball and stared, stared as hard as he could,
willing it to show him something other than swirling white fog, but nothing
happened.
“Well?” Professor Trelawney prompted delicately. “What do you see?”
The heat was overpowering and his nostrils were stinging with the
perfumed smoke wafting from the fire beside them. He thought of what Ron
had just said, and decided to pretend.
“Er —” said Harry, “a dark shape . . . um . . .”
“What does it resemble?” whispered Professor Trelawney. “Think,
now . . .”
Harry cast his mind around and it landed on Buckbeak.
“A hippogriff,” he said firmly.
“Indeed!” whispered Professor Trelawney, scribbling keenly on the
parchment perched upon her knees. “My boy, you may well be seeing the
outcome of poor Hagrid’s trouble with the Ministry of Magic! Look
closer. . . . Does the hippogriff app es turned up and, pretending to think that Harry wanted things thrown at
him, started chucking chairs across the room. Harry and Hermione left in a
hurry before the noise attracted Filch, and went back to the Gryffindor
common room, which was now mercifully empty.
At two o’clock in the morning, Harry stood near the fireplace, surrounded
by heaps of objects: books, quills, several upturned chairs, an old set of
Gobstones, and Neville’s toad, Trevor. Only in the last hour had Harry really
got the hang of the Summoning Charm.
“That’s better, Harry, that’s loads better,” Hermione said, looking exhausted
but very pleased.
“Well, now we know what to do next time I can’t manage a spell,” Harry
said, throwing a rune dictionary back to Hermione, so he could try again,
“threaten me with a dragon. Right . . .” He raised his wand once more. 
“Accio
Dictionary!”
The heavy book soared out of Hermione’s hand, flew across the room, and
Harry caught it.
“Harry, I really think you’ve got it!” said Hermione delightedly.
“Just a ing her to the floor. Meanwhile, the goblin
and the house-elf scuttled toward the fireplaces set along the wall, and the
one-armed centaur galloped at Voldemort, who vanished and reappeared
beside the pool. The headless statue thrust Harry backward, away from the
fight, as Dumbledore advanced on Voldemort and the golden centaur cantered
around them both.
“It was foolish to come here tonight, Tom,” said Dumbledore calmly. “The
Aurors are on their way —”
“By which time I shall be gone, and you dead!” spat Voldemort. He sent
another Killing Curse at Dumbledore but missed, instead hitting the security
guard’s desk, which burst into flame.
Dumbledore flicked his own wand. The force of the spell that emanated
from it was such that Harry, though shielded by his stone guard, felt his hair
stand on end as it passed, and this time Voldemort was forced to conjure a
shining silver shield out of thin air to deflect it. The spell, whatever it was,
caused no visible damage to the shield, though a deep, gonglike note
reverbe be a
very good way to attack you and make it look like an accident.”
“Looks like a really good plan from where I’m standing,” said Harry,
grinning bleakly. “They’ll just have to stand back and let the dragons do their
stuff.”
“Right — these dragons,” said Sirius, speaking very quickly now. “There’s
a way, Harry. Don’t be tempted to try a Stunning Spell — dragons are strong
and too powerfully magical to be knocked out by a single Stunner, you need
about half a dozen wizards at a time to overcome a dragon —”
“Yeah, I know, I just saw,” said Harry.
“But you can do it alone,” said Sirius. “There is a way, and a simple spell’s
all you need. Just —”
But Harry held up a hand to silence him, his heart suddenly pounding as
though it would burst. He could hear footsteps coming down the spiral
staircase behind him.
“Go!” he hissed at Sirius. “
Go!
 There’s someone coming!”Harry scrambled to his feet, hiding the fire — if someone saw Sirius’s face
within the walls of Hogwarts, they would raise an almighty uproar — the
Mi emembering words he
had heard nearly two years before: 
“I was ripped from my body, I was less
than spirit, less than the meanest ghost . . . but still, I was alive.”
“. . . few would want it, Tom, very few. Death would be preferable.”
But Riddle’s hunger was now apparent; his expression was greedy, he
could no longer hide his longing.
“How do you split your soul?”
“Well,” said Slughorn uncomfortably, “you must understand that the soul is
supposed to remain intact and whole. Splitting it is an act of violation, it isagainst nature.”
“But how do you do it?”
“By an act of evil — the supreme act of evil. By committing murder.
Killing rips the soul apart. The wizard intent upon creating a Horcrux would
use the damage to his advantage: He would encase the torn portion —”
“Encase? But how — ?”
“There is a spell, do not ask me, I don’t know!” said Slughorn, shaking his
head like an old elephant bothered by mosquitoes. “Do I look as though I
have tried it — do I look like a killer?”
“No, sir, of course not,” said Rid pe, without preamble, “
why
 did you put on that ring? It
carries a curse, surely you realized that. Why even touch it?”
Marvolo Gaunt’s ring lay on the desk before Dumbledore. It was cracked;
the sword of Gryffindor lay beside it.
Dumbledore grimaced.
“I . . . was a fool. Sorely tempted . . .”
“Tempted by what?”
Dumbledore did not answer.
“It is a miracle you managed to return here!” Snape sounded furious. “That
ring carried a curse of extraordinary power, to contain it is all we can hope
for; I have trapped the curse in one hand for the time being —”
Dumbledore raised his blackened, useless hand, and examined it with the
expression of one being shown an interesting curio.
“You have done very well, Severus. How long do you think I have?”
Dumbledore’s tone was conversational; he might have been asking for a
weather forecast. Snape hesitated, and then said, “I cannot tell. Maybe a year.
There is no halting such a spell forever. It will spread eventually, it is the sort
of curse that strengthens over time.”
Dum now-Who,
do you?”
“I’ve used it against him,” said Harry quietly. “It saved my life last June.”
Smith opened his mouth stupidly. The rest of the room was very quiet.
“But if you think it’s beneath you, you can leave,” Harry said.
Smith did not move. Nor did anybody else.
“Okay,” said Harry, his mouth slightly drier than usual with all those eyes
upon him, “I reckon we should all divide into pairs and practice.”
It felt very odd to be issuing instructions, but not nearly as odd as seeing
them followed. Everybody got to their feet at once and divided up.
Predictably, Neville was left partnerless.
“You can practice with me,” Harry told him. “Right — on the count of
three, then — one, two, three —”
The room was suddenly full of shouts of 
“Expelliarmus!”
: Wands flew in
all directions, missed spells hit books on shelves and sent them flying into the
air. Harry was too quick for Neville, whose wand went spinning out of his
hand, hit the ceiling in a shower of sparks, and landed with a clatter on top of
a bookshelf"

There was a short silence in which many members of the class turned their
heads to frown at the three course aims still written on the blackboard.
“
Using
 defensive spells?” Professor Umbridge repeated with a little laugh.
“Why, I can’t imagine any situation arising in my classroom that would
require you to 
use
 a defensive spell, Miss Granger. You surely aren’t
expecting to be attacked during class?”
“We’re not going to use magic?” Ron ejaculated loudly.
“Students raise their hands when they wish to speak in my class, Mr. — ?”
“Weasley,” said Ron, thrusting his hand into the air.
Professor Umbridge, smiling still more widely, turned her back on him.
Harry and Hermione immediately raised their hands too. Professor
Umbridge’s pouchy eyes lingered on Harry for a moment before she
addressed Hermione.
“Yes, Miss Granger? You wanted to ask something else?”
“Yes,” said Hermione. “Surely the whole point of Defense Against the
Dark Arts is to practice defensive spells?”
“Are you a Minis gainst the Dark Arts,” said
Hermione.
“Me?” said Harry, now grinning more broadly than ever. “No I’m not,
you’ve beaten me in every test —”
“Actually, I haven’t,” said Hermione coolly. “You beat me in our third year
— the only year we both sat the test and had a teacher who actually knew the
subject. But I’m not talking about test results, Harry. Look what you’ve
done
!”
“How d’you mean?”
“You know what, I’m not sure I want someone this stupid teaching me,”
Ron said to Hermione, smirking slightly. He turned to Harry. “Let’s think,” he
said, pulling a face like Goyle concentrating. “Uh . . . first year — you saved
the Stone from You-Know-Who.”
“But that was luck,” said Harry, “that wasn’t skill —”
“Second year,” Ron interrupted, “you killed the basilisk and destroyed
Riddle.”
“Yeah, but if Fawkes hadn’t turned up I —”
“Third year,” said Ron, louder still, “you fought off about a hundred
dementors at once —”
“You know that was a fluke, if the Time-Turner hadn’t —”
“Last year,” Ron said, almost shouting now, “yo n; it hissed menacingly
and turned from turquoise to orange.
“You applied first for the Defense Against the Dark Arts post, I believe?”
Professor Umbridge asked Snape.
“Yes,” said Snape quietly.
“But you were unsuccessful?”
Snape’s lip curled.
“Obviously.”
Professor Umbridge scribbled on her clipboard.
“And you have applied regularly for the Defense Against the Dark Arts
post since you first joined the school, I believe?”
“Yes,” said Snape quietly, barely moving his lips. He looked very angry.
“Do you have any idea why Dumbledore has consistently refused to
appoint you?” asked Umbridge.
“I suggest you ask him,” said Snape jerkily.
“Oh I shall,” said Professor Umbridge with a sweet smile.
“I suppose this is relevant?” Snape asked, his black eyes narrowed.“Oh yes,” said Professor Umbridge. “Yes, the Ministry wants a thorough
understanding of teachers’ — er — backgrounds . . .”
She turned away, walked over to Pansy Parkinson and began questioning
her about the lessons. Snape looked around at Harry and their eyes e Against the Dark Arts again, I’m skiving off,”
said Ron as they headed toward Lupin’s classroom after lunch. “Check who’s
in there, Hermione.”
Hermione peered around the classroom door.
“It’s okay!”
Professor Lupin was back at work. It certainly looked as though he had
been ill. His old robes were hanging more loosely on him and there were dark
shadows beneath his eyes; nevertheless, he smiled at the class as they took
their seats, and they burst at once into an explosion of complaints about
Snape’s behavior while Lupin had been ill.“It’s not fair, he was only filling in, why should he give us homework?”
“We don’t know anything about werewolves —”
“— two rolls of parchment!”
“Did you tell Professor Snape we haven’t covered them yet?” Lupin asked,
frowning slightly.
The babble broke out again.
“Yes, but he said we were really behind —”
“— he wouldn’t listen —”
“— two rolls of parchment!”
Professor Lupin smiled at the look of indignation on every face.
“Don’t worry. I’ll speak to Professor Snape. You don’t ha Dark Arts. Here, for the first time, Harry
felt sure he had passed. He had no problem with any of the written questions
and took particular pleasure, during the practical examination, in performing
all the counterjinxes and defensive spells right in front of Umbridge, who was
watching coolly from near the doors into the entrance hall.
“Oh bravo!” cried Professor Tofty, who was examining Harry again, whenHarry demonstrated a perfect boggart banishing spell. “Very good indeed!
Well, I think that’s all, Potter . . . unless . . .”
He leaned forward a little.
“I heard, from my dear friend Tiberius Ogden, that you can produce a
Patronus? For a bonus point . . . ?”
Harry raised his wand, looked directly at Umbridge, and imagined her
being sacked.
“Expecto Patronum!”
The silver stag erupted from the end of his wand and cantered the length of
the hall. All of the examiners looked around to watch its progress and when it
dissolved into silver mist, Professor Tofty clapped his veined and knotted
hands enthusiastically.
 mbledore. “I had advised Armando against the
appointment — I did not give the reasons I have given you, for Professor
Dippet was very fond of Voldemort and convinced of his honesty. But I did
not want Lord Voldemort back at this school, and especially not in a position
of power.”
“Which job did he want, sir? What subject did he want to teach?”Somehow, Harry knew the answer even before Dumbledore gave it.
“Defense Against the Dark Arts. It was being taught at the time by an old
professor by the name of Galatea Merrythought, who had been at Hogwarts
for nearly fifty years.
“So Voldemort went off to Borgin and Burkes, and all the staff who had
admired him said what a waste it was, a brilliant young wizard like that,
working in a shop. However, Voldemort was no mere assistant. Polite and
handsome and clever, he was soon given particular jobs of the type that only
exist in a place like Borgin and Burkes, which specializes, as you know,
Harry, in objects with unusual and powerful properties. Voldemort was sent to
p rry.”“But I didn’t do anything,” said Harry.
“You and Hermione answered my questions correctly at the start of the
class, Harry,” Lupin said lightly. “Very well, everyone, an excellent lesson.
Homework, kindly read the chapter on boggarts and summarize it for me . . .
to be handed in on Monday. That will be all.”
Talking excitedly, the class left the staffroom. Harry, however, wasn’t
feeling cheerful. Professor Lupin had deliberately stopped him from tackling
the boggart. Why? Was it because he’d seen Harry collapse on the train, and
thought he wasn’t up to much? Had he thought Harry would pass out again?
But no one else seemed to have noticed anything.
“Did you see me take that banshee?” shouted Seamus.
“And the hand!” said Dean, waving his own around.
“And Snape in that hat!”
“And my mummy!”
“I wonder why Professor Lupin’s frightened of crystal balls?” said
Lavender thoughtfully.
“That was the best Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson we’ve ever had,
wasn’t it?” said Ron excitedly as they made their way bac ly were they studying as though they had exams every day, but the
lessons themselves had become more demanding than ever before. Harry
barely understood half of what Professor McGonagall said to them these days;
even Hermione had had to ask her to repeat instructions once or twice.
Incredibly, and to Hermione’s increasing resentment, Harry’s best subject had
suddenly become Potions, thanks to the Half-Blood Prince.
Nonverbal spells were now expected, not only in Defense Against the Dark
Arts, but in Charms and Transfiguration too. Harry frequently looked over at
his classmates in the common room or at mealtimes to see them purple in the
face and straining as though they had overdosed on U-No-Poo; but he knew
that they were really struggling to make spells work without saying
incantations aloud. It was a relief to get outside into the greenhouses; they
were dealing with more dangerous plants than ever in Herbology, but at least
they were still allowed to swear loudly if the Venomous Tentacula seized
them unexp"

the Stone.”
“
You
 let the troll in?”
“Certainly. I have a special gift with trolls — you must have seen what I
did to the one in the chamber back there? Unfortunately, while everyone else
was running around looking for it, Snape, who already suspected me, went
straight to the third floor to head me off — and not only did my troll fail to
beat you to death, that three-headed dog didn’t even manage to bite Snape’s
leg off properly.
“Now, wait quietly, Potter. I need to examine this interesting mirror.”
It was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell. It
was the Mirror of Erised.
“This mirror is the key to finding the Stone,” Quirrell murmured, tapping
his way around the frame. “Trust Dumbledore to come up with something like
this . . . but he’s in London . . . I’ll be far away by the time he gets back. . . .”
All Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and stop him
from concentrating on the mirror.
“I saw you and Sna  said Ron finally. “If any dog needs exercise, that one does.”
Hermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again.
“You don’t use your eyes, any of you, do you?” she snapped. “Didn’t you
see what it was standing on?”
“The floor?” Harry suggested. “I wasn’t looking at its feet, I was too busy
with its heads.”
“No, 
not
 the floor. It was standing on a trapdoor. It’s obviously guardingsomething.”
She stood up, glaring at them.
“I hope you’re pleased with yourselves. We could all have been killed — or
worse, expelled. Now, if you don’t mind, I’m going to bed.”
Ron stared after her, his mouth open.
“No, we don’t mind,” he said. “You’d think we dragged her along,
wouldn’t you?”
But Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as he climbed
back into bed. The dog was guarding something. . . . What had Hagrid said?
Gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to hide
— except perhaps Hogwarts.
It looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby little package
from v ault seven hundred and thirteen was.M
 
CHAPTER  TEN
HALLOWEEN
alfoy couldn’t believe his eyes when he saw that Harry and Ron were
still at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful.
Indeed, by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the three-
headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were quite keen to have
another one. In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the package that
seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot
of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection.
“It’s either really valuable or really dangerous,” said Ron.
“Or both,” said Harry.
But as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was
about two inches long, they didn’t have much chance of guessing what it was
without further clues.
Neither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay
underneath the dog and the trapdoor. All Neville cared about was never going
near the dog again.
Hermione was now refusing to spea library?”
Hagrid shuffled into view, hiding something behind his back. He looked
very out of place in his moleskin overcoat.
“Jus’ lookin’,” he said, in a shifty voice that got their interest at once. “An’
what’re you lot up ter?” He looked suddenly suspicious. “Yer not still lookin’
fer Nicolas Flamel, are yeh?”
“Oh, we found out who he is ages ago,” said Ron impressively. “
And
 we
know what that dog’s guarding, it’s a Sorcerer’s St —”
“Shhhh!”
 Hagrid looked around quickly to see if anyone was listening.
“Don’ go shoutin’ about it, what’s the matter with yeh?”
“There are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a matter of fact,” said
Harry, “about what’s guarding the Stone apart from Fluffy —”
“SHHHH!” said Hagrid again. “Listen — come an’ see me later, I’m not
promisin’ I’ll tell yeh anythin’, mind, but don’ go rabbitin’ about it in here,
students aren’ s’pposed ter know. They’ll think I’ve told yeh —”
“See you later, then,” said Harry.
Hagrid shuffled off.“What was he hiding behind his back?” said Hermione kidded to a stop right in
front of him. He was sprawled on the ground, but Scabbers was back in his
pocket; he had both hands held tight over the quivering lump.“Ron — come on — back under the cloak —” Hermione panted.
“Dumbledore — the Minister — they’ll be coming back out in a minute —”
But before they could cover themselves again, before they could even catch
their breath, they heard the soft pounding of gigantic paws. . . . Something
was bounding toward them out of the dark — an enormous, pale-eyed, jet-
black dog.
Harry reached for his wand, but too late — the dog had made an enormous
leap and the front paws hit him on the chest; he keeled over backward in a
whirl of hair; he felt its hot breath, saw inch-long teeth —
But the force of its leap had carried it too far; it rolled off him. Dazed,
feeling as though his ribs were broken, Harry tried to stand up; he could hear
it growling as it skidded around for a new attack.
Ron was on his feet. As the dog sprang back toward them he pushed Harry
aside; the do de the third-floor corridor — and
the door was already ajar.
“Well, there you are,” Harry said quietly, “Snape’s already got past Fluffy.”
Seeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them
what was facing them. Underneath the Cloak, Harry turned to the other two.
“If you want to go back, I won’t blame you,” he said. “You can take the
Cloak, I won’t need it now.”
“Don’t be stupid,” said Ron.
“We’re coming,” said Hermione.
Harry pushed the door open.
As the door creaked, low, rumbling growls met their ears. All three of the
dog’s noses sniffed madly in their direction, even though it couldn’t see them.
“What’s that at its feet?” Hermione whispered.
“Looks like a harp,” said Ron. “Snape must have left it there.”
“It must wake up the moment you stop playing,” said Harry. “Well, here
goes . . .”
He put Hagrid’s flute to his lips and blew. It wasn’t really a tune, but from
the first note the beast’s eyes began to droop. Harry hardly drew breath.
Slowly, the dog’s growls ceased — it tottered on i ou
believe these objects — these Hallows — actually exist?”
Xenophilius raised his eyebrows again.
“Well, of course.”
“But,” said Hermione, and Harry could hear her restraint starting to crack,
“Mr. Lovegood, how can you 
possibly
 believe — ?”
“Luna has told me all about you, young lady,” said Xenophilius. “You are, I
gather, not unintelligent, but painfully limited. Narrow. Close-minded.”
“Perhaps you ought to try on the hat, Hermione,” said Ron, nodding toward
the ludicrous headdress. His voice shook with the strain of not laughing.“Mr. Lovegood,” Hermione began again. “We all know that there are such
things as Invisibility Cloaks. They are rare, but they exist. But —”
“Ah, but the Third Hallow is a 
true 
Cloak of Invisibility, Miss Granger! I
mean to say, it is not a traveling cloak imbued with a Disillusionment Charm,
or carrying a Bedazzling Hex, or else woven from Demiguise hair, which will
hide one initially but fade with the years until it turns opaque. We are talking
about a cloak that really and t surrection Stone!
”
Hermione had leapt to her feet, looking exasperated and angry. “Harry,
you’re trying to fit everything into the Hallows story —”
“Fit everything in?”
 he repeated. “Hermione, it fits of its own accord! I
know the sign of the Deathly Hallows was on that stone! Gaunt said he was
descended from the Peverells!”
“A minute ago you told us you never saw the mark on the stone properly!”“Where d’you reckon the ring is now?” Ron asked Harry. “What did
Dumbledore do with it after he broke it open?”
But Harry’s imagination was racing ahead, far beyond Ron and
Hermione’s. . . .
Three objects, or Hallows, which, if united, will make the possessor master
of Death . . . Master . . . Conqueror . . . Vanquisher . . . The last enemy that
shall be destroyed is death. . . .
And he saw himself, possessor of the Hallows, facing Voldemort, whose
Horcruxes were no match . . . 
Neither can live while the other survives
. . . .
Was this the answer? Hallows versus Horcruxes? Was there a way, after all, to
ensure that"
What creature is Aragog?,Acromantula,"Aragog is a giant spider, specifically a Acromantula, a species of giant spider that is native to the wizarding world.","d with the light
spilling from Hagrid’s window to illuminate Aragog’s body lying on the edge
of a massive pit beside a ten-foot-high mound of freshly dug earth.
“Magnificent,” said Slughorn, approaching the spider’s head, where eight
milky eyes stared blankly at the sky and two huge, curved pincers shone,
motionless, in the moonlight. Harry thought he heard the tinkle of bottles as
Slughorn bent over the pincers, apparently examining the enormous hairy
head.
“It’s not ev’ryone appreciates how beau’iful they are,” said Hagrid to
Slughorn’s back, tears leaking from the corners of his crinkled eyes. “I didn’
know yeh were int’rested in creatures like Aragog, Horace.”
“Interested? My dear Hagrid, I revere them,” said Slughorn, stepping back
from the body. Harry saw the glint of a bottle disappear beneath his cloak,
though Hagrid, mopping his eyes once more, noticed nothing. “Now . . . shall
we proceed to the burial?”
Hagrid nodded and moved forward. He heaved the gigantic spider into his
arms and, with an enormou pes shifted all around him.
“The thing that lives in the castle,” said Aragog, “is an ancient creature we
spiders fear above all others. Well do I remember how I pleaded with Hagrid
to let me go, when I sensed the beast moving about the school.”
“What is it?” said Harry urgently.
More loud clicking, more rustling; the spiders seemed to be closing in.
“We do not speak of it!” said Aragog fiercely. “We do not name it! I never
even told Hagrid the name of that dread creature, though he asked me, many
times.”
Harry didn’t want to press the subject, not with the spiders pressing closer
on all sides. Aragog seemed to be tired of talking. He was backing slowly into
his domed web, but his fellow spiders continued to inch slowly toward Harry
and Ron.
“We’ll just go, then,” Harry called desperately to Aragog, hearing leaves
rustling behind him.
“Go?” said Aragog slowly. “I think not. . . .”
“But — but —”
“My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid, on my command. But I
cannot deny them fresh meat, when it wanders so will  the misty, domed web, a spider the size of a small
elephant emerged, very slowly. There was gray in the black of his body and
legs, and each of the eyes on his ugly, pincered head was milky white. He was
blind.
“What is it?” he said, clicking his pincers rapidly.
“Men,” clicked the spider who had caught Harry.
“Is it Hagrid?” said Aragog, moving closer, his eight milky eyes wandering
vaguely.
“Strangers,” clicked the spider who had brought Ron.
“Kill them,” clicked Aragog fretfully. “I was sleeping. . . .”
“We’re friends of Hagrid’s,” Harry shouted. His heart seemed to have lefthis chest to pound in his throat.
Click, click, click
 went the pincers of the spiders all around the hollow.
Aragog paused.
“Hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before,” he said slowly.
“Hagrid’s in trouble,” said Harry, breathing very fast. “That’s why we’ve
come.”
“In trouble?” said the aged spider, and Harry thought he heard concern
beneath the clicking pincers. “But why has he sent you?”
Harry thought of getting to his feet low, a hollow that had
been cleared of trees, so that the stars shone brightly onto the worst scene he
had ever laid eyes on.
Spiders. Not tiny spiders like those surging over the leaves below. Spiders
the size of carthorses, eight-eyed, eight-legged, black, hairy, gigantic. The
massive specimen that was carrying Harry made its way down the steep slope
toward a misty, domed web in the very center of the hollow, while its fellows
closed in all around it, clicking their pincers excitedly at the sight of its load.
Harry fell to the ground on all fours as the spider released him. Ron and
Fang thudded down next to him. Fang wasn’t howling anymore, but cowering
silently on the spot. Ron looked exactly like Harry felt. His mouth was
stretched wide in a kind of silent scream and his eyes were popping.
Harry suddenly realized that the spider that had dropped him was saying
something. It had been hard to tell, because he clicked his pincers with every
word he spoke.
“Aragog!” it called. “Aragog!”
And from the middle of s grunt, rolled it into the dark pit. It hit the bottom
with a rather horrible, crunchy thud. Hagrid started to cry again.
“Of course, it’s difficult for you, who knew him best,” said Slughorn, who
like Harry could reach no higher than Hagrid’s elbow, but patted it all the
same. “Why don’t I say a few words?”
He must have got a lot of good quality venom from Aragog, Harry thought,
for Slughorn wore a satisfied smirk as he stepped up to the rim of the pit and
said, in a slow, impressive voice, “Farewell, Aragog, king of arachnids, whose
long and faithful friendship those who knew you won’t forget! Though your
body will decay, your spirit lingers on in the quiet, web-spun places of your
forest home. May your many-eyed descendants ever flourish and your human
friends find solace for the loss they have sustained.”“Tha’ was . . . tha’ was . . . beau’iful!” howled Hagrid, and he collapsed
onto the compost heap, crying harder than ever.
“There, there,” said Slughorn, waving his wand so that the huge pile of
earth ro Aragog.”
“Aragog,” said Harry and Hagrid together.
Both Slughorn and Hagrid drank deeply. Harry, however, with the way
ahead illuminated for him by Felix Felicis, knew that he must not drink, so he
merely pretended to take a gulp and then set the mug back on the table before
him.
“I had him from an egg, yeh know,” said Hagrid morosely. “Tiny little
thing he was when he hatched. ’Bout the size of a Pekingese.”
“Sweet,” said Slughorn.
“Used ter keep him in a cupboard up at the school until . . . well . . .”
Hagrid’s face darkened and Harry knew why: Tom Riddle had contrived to
have Hagrid thrown out of school, blamed for opening the Chamber of
Secrets. Slughorn, however, did not seem to be listening; he was looking up atthe ceiling, from which a number of brass pots hung, and also a long, silky
skein of bright white hair.
“That’s never unicorn hair, Hagrid?”
“Oh, yeah,” said Hagrid indifferently. “Gets pulled out of their tails, they
catch it on branches an’ stuff in the forest, yeh know . . .”
“But my dear cha eyes streaming as he
mopped his face with his apron. “It’s . . . Aragog. . . . I think he’s dyin’. . . .
He got ill over the summer an’ he’s not gettin’ better. . . . I don’ know what I’ll
do if he . . . if he . . . We’ve bin tergether so long. . . .”
Hermione patted Hagrid’s shoulder, looking at a complete loss for anything
to say. Harry knew how she felt. He had known Hagrid to present a vicious
baby dragon with a teddy bear, seen him croon over giant scorpions with
suckers and stingers, attempt to reason with his brutal giant of a half-brother,
but this was perhaps the most incomprehensible of all his monster fancies: the
gigantic talking spider, Aragog, who dwelled deep in the Forbidden Forest
and which he and Ron had only narrowly escaped four years previously.
“Is there — is there anything we can do?” Hermione asked, ignoring Ron’s
frantic grimaces and head-shakings.
“I don’ think there is, Hermione,” choked Hagrid, attempting to stem the
flood of his tears. “See, the rest o’ the tribe . . . Aragog’s fa  was the highest
point of Hagrid he could easily reach.
“Where are we burying him?” he asked. “The forest?”
“Blimey, no,” said Hagrid, wiping his streaming eyes on the bottom of his
shirt. “The other spiders won’ let me anywhere near their webs now Aragog’s
gone. Turns out it was on’y on his orders they didn’ eat me! Can yeh believe
that, Harry?”
The honest answer was “yes”; Harry recalled with painful ease the scene
when he and Ron had come face-to-face with the acromantulas: They had
been quite clear that Aragog was the only thing that stopped them from eating
Hagrid.
“Never bin an area o’ the forest I couldn’ go before!” said Hagrid, shaking
his head. “It wasn’ easy, gettin’ Aragog’s body out o’ there, I can tell yeh —
they usually eat their dead, see. . . . But I wanted ter give ’im a nice burial . . .
a proper send-off . . .”
He broke into sobs again and Harry resumed the patting of his elbow,
saying as he did so (for the potion seemed to indicate that it was the rightthing to do), “Professor Slughorn me"
Who does Harry marry?,Ginny Weasley,"According to the text, Harry does not marry anyone in the Harry Potter series. The context of the passage is discussing the Triwizard Cup and the tradition of the champions and their partners opening the ball at the dance.","ing to be married!”“Oh,” said Harry blankly. He could not help noticing how Mrs. Weasley,
Hermione, and Ginny were all determinedly avoiding one another’s gaze.
“Wow. Er — congratulations!”
She swooped down upon him and kissed him again.
“Bill is very busy at ze moment, working very ’ard, and I only work part-
time at Gringotts for my Eenglish, so he brought me ’ere for a few days to get
to know ’is family properly. I was so pleased to ’ear you would be coming —
zere isn’t much to do ’ere, unless you like cooking and chickens! Well —
enjoy your breakfast, ’Arry!”
With these words she turned gracefully and seemed to float out of the
room, closing the door quietly behind her.
Mrs. Weasley made a noise that sounded like “tchah!”
“Mum hates her,” said Ginny quietly.
“I do not hate her!” said Mrs. Weasley in a cross whisper. “I just think
they’ve hurried into this engagement, that’s all!”
“They’ve known each other a year,” said Ron, who looked oddly groggy
and was staring at the closed door.
“Well, that’s not very  partners?” He felt himself going red. “I don’t dance,” he said
quickly.
“Oh yes, you do,” said Professor McGonagall irritably. “That’s what I’m
telling you. Traditionally, the champions and their partners open the ball.”
Harry had a sudden mental image of himself in a top hat and tails,
accompanied by a girl in the sort of frilly dress Aunt Petunia always wore to
Uncle Vernon’s work parties.
“I’m not dancing,” he said.
“It is traditional,” said Professor McGonagall firmly. “You are a Hogwarts
champion, and you will do what is expected of you as a representative of the
school. So make sure you get yourself a partner, Potter.”
“But — I don’t —”
“You heard me, Potter,” said Professor McGonagall in a very final sort of
way.
A week ago, Harry would have said finding a partner for a dance would be a
cinch compared to taking on a Hungarian Horntail. But now that he had done
the latter, and was facing the prospect of asking a girl to the ball, he thought
he’d rather have another round with the dragon.
Harry had neve that he had not been thinking about the sword
at all when he suggested they go to Godric’s Hollow. For him, the lure of the
village lay in his parents’ graves, the house where he had narrowly escaped
death, and in the person of Bathilda Bagshot.
“Remember what Muriel said?” he asked eventually.
“Who?”
“You know,” he hesitated: He did not want to say Ron’s name. “Ginny’s
great-aunt. At the wedding. The one who said you had skinny ankles.”
“Oh,” said Hermione. It was a sticky moment: Harry knew that she had
sensed Ron’s name in the offing. He rushed on:
“She said Bathilda Bagshot still lives in Godric’s Hollow.”
“Bathilda Bagshot,” murmured Hermione, running her index finger over
Bathilda’s embossed name on the front cover of 
A History of Magic.
 “Well, I
suppose —”
She gasped so dramatically that Harry’s insides turned over; he drew his
wand, looking around at the entrance, half expecting to see a hand forcing its
way through the entrance flap, but there was nothing there.
“What?” he said, half angry, half re er Madam Pomfrey’s care. His scars were as bad as ever
— in truth, he now bore a distinct resemblance to Mad-Eye Moody, though
thankfully with both eyes and legs — but in personality he seemed just the
same as ever. All that appeared to have changed was that he now had a great
liking for very rare steaks.
“. . . so eet ees lucky ’e is marrying me,” said Fleur happily, plumping up
Bill’s pillows, “because ze British overcook their meat, I ’ave always said
this.”
“I suppose I’m just going to have to accept that he really is going to marry
her,” sighed Ginny later that evening, as she, Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat
beside the open window of the Gryffindor common room, looking out over
the twilit grounds.
“She’s not that bad,” said Harry. “Ugly, though,” he added hastily, as Ginny
raised her eyebrows, and she let out a reluctant giggle.
“Well, I suppose if Mum can stand it, I can.”
“Anyone else we know died?” Ron asked Hermione, who was perusing the
Evening Prophet.
Hermione winced at the forced toughness in his v  “You are 
so
 like Ron —”
“— and he said he’d come to see her off! And then he told me to go away.
He’s 
snogging 
her!” James added as though worried he had not made himself
clear.
“Oh, it would be lovely if they got married!” whispered Lily ecstatically.
“Teddy would 
really 
be part of the family then!”
“He already comes round for dinner about four times a week,” said Harry.
“Why don’t we just invite him to live with us and have done with it?”
“Yeah!” said James enthusiastically. “I don’t mind sharing with Al —
Teddy could have my room!”
“No,” said Harry firmly, “you and Al will share a room only when I want
the house demolished.”
He checked the battered old watch that had once been Fabian Prewett’s.
“It’s nearly eleven, you’d better get on board.”
“Don’t forget to give Neville our love!” Ginny told James as she hugged
him.
“Mum! I can’t give a professor 
love
!”“But you 
know 
Neville —”
James rolled his eyes.
“Outside, yeah, but at school he’s Professor Longbottom, isn’t he? I can’t
walk into Herbology  ed marquee. “Or is he a relative?” he added with a glance at Harry’s red
curly hair.
“Cousin,” Harry muttered, but Krum was not really listening. His
appearance was causing a stir, particularly amongst the veela cousins: He
was, after all, a famous Quidditch player. While people were still craning their
necks to get a good look at him, Ron, Hermione, Fred, and George came
hurrying down the aisle.“Time to sit down,” Fred told Harry, “or we’re going to get run over by the
bride.”
Harry, Ron, and Hermione took their seats in the second row behind Fred
and George. Hermione looked rather pink and Ron’s ears were still scarlet.
After a few moments he muttered to Harry, “Did you see he’s grown a stupid
little beard?”
Harry gave a noncommittal grunt.
A sense of jittery anticipation had filled the warm tent, the general
murmuring broken by occasional spurts of excited laughter. Mr. and Mrs.
Weasley strolled up the aisle, smiling and waving at relatives; Mrs. Weasley
was wearing a brand-new set of amethyst-colored robe one.“Oh come on,” he said impatiently, “we need partners, we’re going to look
really stupid if we haven’t got any, everyone else has . . .”
“I can’t come with you,” said Hermione, now blushing, “because I’m
already going with someone.”
“No, you’re not!” said Ron. “You just said that to get rid of Neville!”
“Oh 
did
 I?” said Hermione, and her eyes flashed dangerously. “Just
because it’s taken 
you
 three years to notice, Ron, doesn’t mean no one 
else
has spotted I’m a girl!”
Ron stared at her. Then he grinned again.
“Okay, okay, we know you’re a girl,” he said. “That do? Will you come
now?”
“I’ve already told you!” Hermione said very angrily. “I’m going with
someone else!”
And she stormed off toward the girls’ dormitories again.
“She’s lying,” said Ron flatly, watching her go.
“She’s not,” said Ginny quietly.
“Who is it then?” said Ron sharply.
“I’m not telling you, it’s her business,” said Ginny.
“Right,” said Ron, who looked extremely put out, “this is getting stupid.
Ginny,

 can go with Harry, and I’ n
impregnable fortress. “When we get back to the common room tonight, we’ll
both have partners — agreed?”
“Er . . . okay,” said Harry.
But every time he glimpsed Cho that day — during break, and then
lunchtime, and once on the way to History of Magic — she was surrounded
by friends. Didn’t she 
ever
 go anywhere alone? Could he perhaps ambush her
as she was going into a bathroom? But no — she even seemed to go there
with an escort of four or five girls. Yet if he didn’t do it soon, she was bound
to have been asked by somebody else.
He found it hard to concentrate on Snape’s Potions test, and consequently
forgot to add the key ingredient — a bezoar — meaning that he received
bottom marks. He didn’t care, though; he was too busy screwing up his
courage for what he was about to do. When the bell rang, he grabbed his bag,
and hurried to the dungeon door.
“I’ll meet you at dinner,” he said to Ron and Hermione, and he dashed off
upstairs.
He’d just have to ask Cho for a private word, that was all. . . . He hurried

“Undesirable Number One,” Harry muttered under his breath as he
replaced Mr. Weasley’s folder and shut the drawer. He had an idea he knew
who that was, and sure enough, as he straightened up and glanced around the
office for fresh hiding places, he saw a poster of himself on the wall, with the
words 
UNDESIRABLE NO. 1
 emblazoned across his chest. A little pink note was
stuck to it with a picture of a kitten in the corner. Harry moved across to read
it and saw that Umbridge had written, 
“To be punished.”
Angrier than ever, he proceeded to grope in the bottoms of the vases and
baskets of dried flowers, b and ends up

“I think he’s brilliant,” said Harry coldly.
“
Do

are your parents?”
“They’re dead,” said Harry shortly. He didn’t feel much like going into the
matter with this boy.
“Oh, sorry,” said the other, not sounding sorry at all. “But they were

“They were a witch and wizard, if that’s what you mean.”
“I really don’t think they should let the other sort in, do you? They’re just

they should keep it in the old wizarding families. What’s your surname,
anyway?”
But before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, “That’s you done, my
dear,” and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped
down from the footstool.
“Well, I’ll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,” said the drawling boy.

Quidditch team, and bringing up the rear, Fred and George Weasley with their
friend Lee Jordan, all three of whom were carrying large paper bags crammed
with Zonko’s merchandise.
“A couple of people?” said Harry hoarsely to Hermione. “A 
couple of
people
?”
“Yes, well, the idea seemed quite popular,” said Hermione ha n his investigations
into his previously despised mother’s family — the woman whom, you will
remember, he had thought could not be a witch if she had succumbed to the
shameful human weakness of death.
“All he had to go upon was the single name ‘Marvolo,’ which he knew
from those who ran the orphanage had been his mother’s father’s name.
Finally, after painstaking research through old books of Wizarding families,
he discovered the existence of Slytherin’s surviving line. In the summer of his
sixteenth year, he left the orphanage to which he returned annually and set off
to find his Gaunt relatives. And now, Harry, if you will stand . . .”
Dumbledore rose, and Harry saw that he was again holding a small crystal
bottle filled with swirling, pearly memory.
“I was very lucky to collect this,” he said, as he poured the gleaming mass
into the Pensieve. “As you will understand when we have experienced it.
Shall we?”
Harry stepped up to the stone basin and bowed obediently until his face
sank through the surface of th ?” asked Harry, who found Ron just as
interesting as Ron found him.
“Er — yes, I think so,” said Ron. “I think Mum’s got a second cousin
who’s an accountant, but we never talk about him.”
“So you must know loads of magic already.”The Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale boy
in Diagon Alley had talked about.
“I heard you went to live with Muggles,” said Ron. “What are they like?”
“Horrible — well, not all of them. My aunt and uncle and cousin are,
though. Wish I’d had three wizard brothers.”
“Five,” said Ron. For some reason, he was looking gloomy. “I’m the sixth
in our family to go to Hogwarts. You could say I’ve got a lot to live up to. Bill
and Charlie have already left — Bill was head boy and Charlie was captain of
Quidditch. Now Percy’s a prefect. Fred and George mess around a lot, but
they still get really good marks and everyone thinks they’re really funny.
Everyone expects me to do as well as the others, but if I do, it’s no big deal,
because they did it first. You never g th
laughter at some long-forgotten joke. Harry dropped his eyes to the caption.
Albus Dumbledore, shortly after his mother’s death, with his friend
Gellert Grindelwald.
Harry gaped at the last word for several long moments. Grindelwald. His
friend Grindelwald. He looked sideways at Hermione, who was still
contemplating the name as though she could not believe her eyes. Slowly she
looked up at Harry.
“Grindelwald?”
Ignoring the remainder of the photographs, Harry searched the pages
around them for a recurrence of that fatal name. He soon discovered it and
read greedily, but became lost: It was necessary to go further back to make
sense of it all, and eventually he found himself at the start of a chapter entitled“The Greater Good.” Together, he and Hermione started to read:
Now approaching his eighteenth birthday, Dumbledore left Hogwarts in
a blaze of glory — Head Boy, Prefect, Winner of the Barnabus Finkley
Prize for Exceptional Spell-Casting, British Youth Representative to the
Wizengamot, Gold Medal-Winner   about that
now?”
“No — no — Harry, I didn’t mean that!” she said hastily, looking around to
check that they were not being overheard. “It’s just that I was right about
Eileen Prince once owning the book. You see . . . she was Snape’s mother!”
“I thought she wasn’t much of a looker,” said Ron. Hermione ignored him.
“I was going through the rest of the old 
Prophets
 and there was a tiny
announcement about Eileen Prince marrying a man called Tobias Snape, and
then later an announcement saying that she’d given birth to a —”
“— murderer,” spat Harry.
“Well . . . yes,” said Hermione. “So . . . I was sort of right. Snape must have
been proud of being ‘half a Prince,’ you see? Tobias Snape was a Muggle
from what it said in the 
Prophet.
”
“Yeah, that fits,” said Harry. “He’d play up the pure-blood side so he could
get in with Lucius Malfoy and the rest of them. . . . He’s just like Voldemort.
Pure-blood mother, Muggle father . . . ashamed of his parentage, trying to
make himself feared using the Dark Arts, gave him  by a curly-haired
Hufflepuff boy Harry knew by sight but had never spoken to.
“Justin Finch-Fletchley,” he said brightly, shaking Harry by the hand.
“Know who you are, of course, the famous Harry Potter. . . . And you’re
Hermione Granger — always top in everything” (Hermione beamed as she
had her hand shaken too) “— and Ron Weasley. Wasn’t that your flying car?”
Ron didn’t smile. The Howler was obviously still on his mind.
“That Lockhart’s something, isn’t he?” said Justin happily as they began
filling their plant pots with dragon dung compost. “Awfully brave chap. Have
you read his books? I’d have died of fear if I’d been cornered in a telephone
booth by a werewolf, but he stayed cool and — zap — just 
fantastic.
“My name was down for Eton, you know. I can’t tell you how glad I am Icame here instead. Of course, Mother was slightly disappointed, but since I
made her read Lockhart’s books I think she’s begun to see how useful it’ll be
to have a fully trained wizard in the family. . . .”
After that they didn’t"
What is the name of the wand shop in Diagon Alley?,Ollivanders,The name of the wand shop in Diagon Alley is Ollivanders.,"most fascinating
Wizarding shops in the world, Harry felt no desire to break his word to Fudge
and stray back into the Muggle world.
Harry ate breakfast each morning in the Leaky Cauldron, where he liked
watching the other guests: funny little witches from the country, up for a day’s
shopping; venerable-looking wizards arguing over the latest article in
Transfiguration Today
; wild-looking warlocks; raucous dwarfs; and once,
what looked suspiciously like a hag, who ordered a plate of raw liver from
behind a thick woollen balaclava.
After breakfast Harry would go out into the backyard, take out his wand,
tap the third brick from the left above the trash bin, and stand back as the
archway into Diagon Alley opened in the wall.
Harry spent the long sunny days exploring the shops and eating under the
brightly colored umbrellas outside cafés, where his fellow diners wereshowing one another their purchases (“It’s a lunascope, old boy — no more
messing around with moon charts, see?”) or else discussing the case of Si anced at
Hermione and drew back into the shadows.
“Madam Lestrange,” murmured Tom, and as Hermione passed he inclined
his head subserviently.
“Good morning,” said Hermione, and as Harry crept past, still carrying
Griphook piggyback under the Cloak, he saw Tom look surprised.
“Too polite,” Harry whispered in Hermione’s ear as they passed out of the
inn into the tiny backyard. “You need to treat people like they’re scum!”“Okay, okay!”
Hermione drew out Bellatrix’s wand and tapped a brick in the nondescript
wall in front of them. At once the bricks began to whirl and spin: A hole
appeared in the middle of them, which grew wider and wider, finally forming
an archway onto the narrow cobbled street that was Diagon Alley.
It was quiet, barely time for the shops to open, and there were hardly any
shoppers abroad. The crooked, cobbled street was much altered now from the
bustling place Harry had visited before his first term at Hogwarts so many
years before. More shops than ever were boarded up, though several new
est e entrance
and paused, looking around.
Diagon Alley had changed. The colorful, glittering window displays of
spellbooks, potion ingredients, and cauldrons were lost to view, hidden behind
the large Ministry of Magic posters that had been pasted over them. Most of
these somber purple posters carried blown-up versions of the security advice
on the Ministry pamphlets that had been sent out over the summer, but others
bore moving black-and-white photographs of Death Eaters known to be on
the loose. Bellatrix Lestrange was sneering from the front of the nearest
apothecary. A few windows were boarded up, including those of Florean
Fortescue’s Ice Cream Parlor. On the other hand, a number of shabby-looking
stalls had sprung up along the street. The nearest one, which had been erected
outside Flourish and Blotts, under a striped, stained awning, had a cardboard
sign pinned to its front:AMULETS
Effective Against Werewolves, Dementors, and Inferi
A seedy-looking little wizard was rattling armfuls of silver symbols on
c pect you’ve had a lotta
presents from them Dursleys. Just Ollivanders left now — only place fer
wands, Ollivanders, and yeh gotta have the best wand.”
A magic wand . . . this was what Harry had been really looking forward to.
The last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold letters over the door
read Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 
B.C.
 A single wand lay on a
faded purple cushion in the dusty window.
A tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped
inside. It was a tiny place, empty except for a single, spindly chair that Hagrid
sat on to wait. Harry felt strangely as though he had entered a very strict
library; he swallowed a lot of new questions that had just occurred to him and
looked instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to theceiling. For some reason, the back of his neck prickled. The very dust and
silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret magic.
“Good afternoon,” said a soft voice. Harry jumped. Hagrid must have
jumped, too, becaus ted. They peered into windows as they passed, but none of
the shops seemed to have any customers at all. Harry supposed it was a bit ofa giveaway in these dangerous and suspicious times to buy Dark artifacts —
or at least, to be seen buying them.
Hermione gave his arm a hard pinch.
“Ouch!”
“Shh! Look! He’s in there!” she breathed in Harry’s ear.
They had drawn level with the only shop in Knockturn Alley that Harry
had ever visited, Borgin and Burkes, which sold a wide variety of sinister
objects. There in the midst of the cases full of skulls and old bottles stood
Draco Malfoy with his back to them, just visible beyond the very same large
black cabinet in which Harry had once hidden to avoid Malfoy and his father.
Judging by the movements of Malfoy’s hands, he was talking animatedly. The
proprietor of the shop, Mr. Borgin, an oily-haired, stooping man, stood facing
Malfoy. He was wearing a curious expression of mingled resentment and fear.
“If only we could hear what they’re saying!” said Hermione.
“We can!”   Keep to Diagon Alley. And
you’re to be back here before dark each night. Sure you’ll understand. Tom
will be keeping an eye on you for me.”
“Okay,” said Harry slowly, “but why — ?”
“Don’t want to lose you again, do we?” said Fudge with a hearty laugh.
“No, no . . . best we know where you are. . . . I mean . . .”
Fudge cleared his throat loudly and picked up his pinstriped cloak.
“Well, I’ll be off, plenty to do, you know. . . .”
“Have you had any luck with Black yet?” Harry asked.Fudge’s finger slipped on the silver fastenings of his cloak.
“What’s that? Oh, you’ve heard — well, no, not yet, but it’s only a matter
of time. The Azkaban guards have never yet failed . . . and they are angrier
than I’ve ever seen them.”
Fudge shuddered slightly.
“So, I’ll say good-bye.”
He held out his hand and Harry, shaking it, had a sudden idea.
“Er — Minister? Can I ask you something?”
“Certainly,” said Fudge with a smile.
“Well, third years at Hogwarts are allowed to visit Hogsmeade, but my aunt
and uncle didn’t sign the pe Bagman. Rita Skeeter settled herself down in
a corner; Harry saw her slip the parchment out of her bag again, spread it on
her knee, suck the end of the Quick-Quotes Quill, and place it once more on
the parchment.
“May I introduce Mr. Ollivander?” said Dumbledore, taking his place at the
judges’ table and talking to the champions. “He will be checking your wands
to ensure that they are in good condition before the tournament.”
Harry looked around, and with a jolt of surprise saw an old wizard with
large, pale eyes standing quietly by the window. Harry had met Mr.
Ollivander before — he was the wandmaker from whom Harry had bought
his own wand over three years ago in Diagon Alley.
“Mademoiselle Delacour, could we have you first, please?” said Mr.Ollivander, stepping into the empty space in the middle of the room.
Fleur Delacour swept over to Mr. Ollivander and handed him her wand.
“Hmmm . . .” he said.
He twirled the wand between his long fingers like a baton and it emitted a
number of pink and gold sparks. Th erfectly
capable of doing my shopping 
alone.
”
There was a clucking noise and a voice Harry recognized as that of Madam
Malkin, the owner, said, “Now, dear, your mother’s quite right, none of us is
supposed to go wandering around on our own anymore, it’s nothing to do
with being a child —”
“Watch where you’re sticking that pin, will you!”
A teenage boy with a pale, pointed face and white-blond hair appeared
from behind the rack, wearing a handsome set of dark green robes that
glittered with pins around the hem and the edges of the sleeves. He strode to
the mirror and examined himself; it was a few moments before he noticed
Harry, Ron, and Hermione reflected over his shoulder. His light gray eyes
narrowed.
“If you’re wondering what the smell is, Mother, a Mudblood just walked
in,” said Draco Malfoy.
“I don’t think there’s any need for language like that!” said Madam Malkin,
scurrying out from behind the clothes rack holding a tape measure and a
wand. “And I don’t want wands drawn in my shop either!” she added"
Who is the head of Slytherin House?,Severus Snape,"The head of Slytherin House is Salazar Slytherin, a Parselmouth and one of the four founders of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.","use
Lord Voldemort — 
who 
is
 the last remaining descendant of Salazar Slytherin
— 
can speak Parseltongue. Unless I’m much mistaken, he transferred some of
his own powers to you the night he gave you that scar. Not something he
intended to do, I’m sure. . . .”
“Voldemort put a bit of himself in 
me
?” Harry said, thunderstruck.
“It certainly seems so.”
“So I 
should 
be in Slytherin,” Harry said, looking desperately into
Dumbledore’s face. “The Sorting Hat could see Slytherin’s power in me, and
it —”
“Put you in Gryffindor,” said Dumbledore calmly. “Listen to me, Harry.
You happen to have many qualities Salazar Slytherin prized in his hand-
picked students. His own very rare gift, Parseltongue — 
resourcefulness —
determination — 
a certain disregard for rules,” he added, his mustache
quivering again. “Yet the Sorting Hat placed you in Gryffindor. You know
why that was. Think.”
“It only put me in Gryffindor,” said Harry in a defeated voice, “because I
asked not to go in Slytherin. . . .”
“Exactly,”
 said Du  a Slytherin. Perhaps it was Harry’s
imagination, after all he’d heard about Slytherin, but he thought they looked
like an unpleasant lot.
He was starting to feel definitely sick now. He remembered being picked
for teams during gym at his old school. He had always been last to be chosen,
not because he was no good, but because no one wanted Dudley to think they
liked him.
“Finch-Fletchley, Justin!”
“HUFFLEPUFF!”
Sometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the House at once, but at
others it took a little while to decide. “Finnigan, Seamus,” the sandy-haired
boy next to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a whole minute
before the hat declared him a Gryffindor.
“Granger, Hermione!”
Hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head.
“GRYFFINDOR!” shouted the hat. Ron groaned.
A horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts always do when
you’re very nervous. What if he wasn’t chosen at all? What if he just sat there
with the hat over his eyes for ages, until Professor Mc rom a doorway to the right — the
rest of the school must already be here — but Professor McGonagall showed
the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in,
standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering
about nervously.
“Welcome to Hogwarts,” said Professor McGonagall. “The start-of-term
banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall,
you will be sorted into your Houses. The Sorting is a very importantceremony because, while you are here, your House will be something like
your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your
House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free time in your House
common room.
“The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and
Slytherin. Each House has its own noble history and each has produced
outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs
will earn your House points, while any rule-breaking will lose House points.
At the end of the us,
you know. Charming girl. I used to tell her she ought to have been in my
House. Very cheeky answers I used to get back too.”
“Which was your House?”
“I was Head of Slytherin,” said Slughorn. “Oh, now,” he went on quickly,
seeing the expression on Harry’s face and wagging a stubby finger at him,
“don’t go holding that against me! You’ll be Gryffindor like her, I suppose?
Yes, it usually goes in families. Not always, though. Ever heard of Sirius
Black? You must have done — been in the papers for the last couple of years
— died a few weeks ago —”
It was as though an invisible hand had twisted Harry’s intestines and held
them tight.
“Well, anyway, he was a big pal of your father’s at school. The whole
Black family had been in my House, but Sirius ended up in Gryffindor!
Shame — he was a talented boy. I got his brother, Regulus, when he came
along, but I’d have liked the set.”
He sounded like an enthusiastic collector who had been outbid at auction.
Apparently lost in memories, he gazed at the opposite wall, t  the Slytherins. Then
the Hufflepuffs stood, and almost at the same moment, the Ravenclaws, all of
them with their backs to Harry, all of them looking toward Pansy instead, and
Harry, awestruck and overwhelmed, saw wands emerging everywhere, pulled
from beneath cloaks and from under sleeves.
“Thank you, Miss Parkinson,” said Professor McGonagall in a clipped
voice. “You will leave the Hall first with Mr. Filch. If the rest of your House
could follow.”
Harry heard the grinding of benches and then the sound of the Slytherins
trooping out on the other side of the Hall.
“Ravenclaws, follow on!” cried Professor McGonagall.
Slowly the four tables emptied. The Slytherin table was completely
deserted, but a number of older Ravenclaws remained seated while their
fellows filed out; even more Hufflepuffs stayed behind, and half of Gryffindor
remained in their seats, necessitating Professor McGonagall’s descent from
the teachers’ platform to chivvy the underage on their way.
“Absolutely not, Creevey, go! 
And
 you, Peake ould help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about
that. . . .
But Harry, who had already heard of Slytherin House’s reputation forturning out Dark wizards, had thought desperately, 
Not Slytherin!
 and the hat
had said, 
Oh, well, if you’re sure . . . better be Gryffindor. . . .
As they were shunted along in the throng, Colin Creevey went past.
“Hiya, Harry!”
“Hullo, Colin,” said Harry automatically.
“Harry — Harry — a boy in my class has been saying you’re —”
But Colin was so small he couldn’t fight against the tide of people bearing
him toward the Great Hall; they heard him squeak, “See you, Harry!” and he
was gone.
“What’s a boy in his class saying about you?” Hermione wondered.
“That I’m Slytherin’s heir, I expect,” said Harry, his stomach dropping
another inch or so as he suddenly remembered the way Justin Finch-Fletchley
had run away from him at lunchtime.
“People here’ll believe anything,” said Ron in disgust.
The crowd thinned and they were able to climb the next staircase without
difficulty.
“D’y  long line
of scared-looking first years filing into the Hall. Ginny was among them,
easily visible because of her vivid Weasley hair. Meanwhile, Professor
McGonagall, a bespectacled witch with her hair in a tight bun, was placing
the famous Hogwarts Sorting Hat on a stool before the newcomers.
Every year, this aged old hat, patched, frayed, and dirty, sorted new
students into the four Hogwarts Houses (Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw,
and Slytherin). Harry well remembered putting it on, exactly one year ago,and waiting, petrified, for its decision as it muttered aloud in his ear. For a
few horrible seconds he had feared that the hat was going to put him in
Slytherin, the House that had turned out more Dark witches and wizards than
any other — but he had ended up in Gryffindor, along with Ron, Hermione,
and the rest of the Weasleys. Last term, Harry and Ron had helped Gryffindor
win the House Championship, beating Slytherin for the first time in seven
years.
A very small, mousy-haired boy had been called for uced myself?
Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington at your service. Resident ghost of
Gryffindor Tower.”
“I know who you are!” said Ron suddenly. “My brothers told me about you
— you’re Nearly Headless Nick!”
“I would 
prefer
 you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy —” the ghost began
stiffly, but sandy-haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted.
“
Nearly
 Headless? How can you be 
nearly
 headless?”
Sir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little chat wasn’t going at
all the way he wanted.
“Like 
this,
” he said irritably. He seized his left ear and pulled. His whole
head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge.
Someone had obviously tried to behead him, but not done it properly.
Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces, Nearly Headless Nick
flipped his head back onto his neck, coughed, and said, “So — new
Gryffindors! I hope you’re going to help us win the House Championship this
year? Gryffindors have never gone so long without winning. Slytherins havegot the Cup six years"
What potion grants good luck?,Felix Felicis,"Felix Felicis, also known as Liquid Luck, is the potion that grants good luck. According to Slughorn, it makes the drinker's endeavors tend to succeed, at least until the effects wear off. However, it can be dangerous to take in excess, causing giddiness, recklessness, and overconfidence.","“that you know what Felix Felicis does, Miss
Granger?”
“It’s liquid luck,” said Hermione excitedly. “It makes you lucky!”
The whole class seemed to sit up a little straighter. Now all Harry could see
of Malfoy was the back of his sleek blond head, because he was at last giving
Slughorn his full and undivided attention.
“Quite right, take another ten points for Gryffindor. Yes, it’s a funny little
potion, Felix Felicis,” said Slughorn. “Desperately tricky to make, and
disastrous to get wrong. However, if brewed correctly, as this has been, you
will find that all your endeavors tend to succeed . . . at least until the effects
wear off.”“Why don’t people drink it all the time, sir?” said Terry Boot eagerly.
“Because if taken in excess, it causes giddiness, recklessness, and
dangerous overconfidence,” said Slughorn. “Too much of a good thing, you
know . . . highly toxic in large quantities. But taken sparingly, and very
occasionally . . .”
“Have you ever taken it, sir?” asked Michael Corner with great interest.
“ morning. It was full of golden potion and the cork was still tightly
sealed with wax. “I wanted Ron to think I’d done it, so I faked it when I knew
you were looking.” He looked at Ron. “You saved everything because you felt
lucky. You did it all yourself.”
He pocketed the potion again.
“There really wasn’t anything in my pumpkin juice?” Ron said, astounded.
“But the weather’s good . . . and Vaisey couldn’t play. . . . I honestly haven’t
been given lucky potion?”
Harry shook his head. Ron gaped at him for a moment, then rounded on
Hermione, imitating her voice. “
You added Felix Felicis to Ron’s juice this
morning, that’s why he saved everything!
 See! I can save goals without help,
Hermione!”
“I never said you couldn’t — Ron, 
you
 thought you’d been given it too!”
But Ron had already strode past her out of the door with his broomstick
over his shoulder.
“Er,” said Harry into the sudden silence; he had not expected his plan to
backfire like this, “shall . . . shall we go up to the party, then?”
“You go!” said ed.
Harry shrugged and continued what he was doing. Seven stirs
counterclockwise, one clockwise, pause . . . seven stirs counterclockwise, one
stir clockwise . . .
Across the table, Ron was cursing fluently under his breath; his potion
looked like liquid licorice. Harry glanced around. As far as he could see, noone else’s potion had turned as pale as his. He felt elated, something that had
certainly never happened before in this dungeon.
“And time’s . . . up!” called Slughorn. “Stop stirring, please!”
Slughorn moved slowly among the tables, peering into cauldrons. He made
no comment, but occasionally gave the potions a stir or a sniff. At last he
reached the table where Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ernie were sitting. He
smiled ruefully at the tarlike substance in Ron’s cauldron. He passed over
Ernie’s navy concoction. Hermione’s potion he gave an approving nod. Then
he saw Harry’s, and a look of incredulous delight spread over his face.
“The clear winner!” he cried to the dungeon. “Excellent, excellent, Harry!
 d just taken out of her bag.
“Luck can only get you so far, Harry. The situation with Slughorn was
different; you always had the ability to persuade him, you just needed to
tweak the circumstances a bit. Luck isn’t enough to get you through a
powerful enchantment, though. Don’t go wasting the rest of that potion!
You’ll need all the luck you can get if Dumbledore takes you along with him
. . .” She dropped her voice to a whisper.
“Couldn’t we make some more?” Ron asked Harry, ignoring Hermione.
“It’d be great to have a stock of it. . . . Have a look in the book . . .”
Harry pulled his copy of 
Advanced Potion-Making
 out of his bag and
looked up Felix Felicis.
“Blimey, it’s seriously complicated,” he said, running an eye down the list
of ingredients. “And it takes six months . . . You’ve got to let it stew. . . .”
“Typical,” said Ron.
Harry was about to put his book away again when he noticed the corner of
a page folded down; turning to it, he saw the 
Sectumsempra
 spell, captioned
“For Enemies,” that he had doubtedly are, I expect you to
scrape an ‘Acceptable’ in your O.W.L., or suffer my . . . displeasure.”
His gaze lingered this time upon Neville, who gulped.
“After this year, of course, many of you will cease studying with me,”
Snape went on. “I take only the very best into my N.E.W.T. Potions class,
which means that some of us will certainly be saying good-bye.”
His eyes rested on Harry and his lip curled. Harry glared back, feeling a
grim pleasure at the idea that he would be able to give up Potions after fifth
year.
“But we have another year to go before that happy moment of farewell,”
said Snape softly, “so whether you are intending to attempt N.E.W.T. or not, I
advise all of you to concentrate your efforts upon maintaining the high-pass
level I have come to expect from my O.W.L. students.
“Today we will be mixing a potion that often comes up at Ordinary
Wizarding Level: the Draught of Peace, a potion to calm anxiety and soothe
agitation. Be warned: If you are too heavy-handed with the ingredients you
wil  stuff. . . . Well, good luck!”
She hurried off down the spiral staircase toward Lavender.
“Ronald Weasley,” said the familiar, misty voice from over their heads.
Ron grimaced at Harry and climbed the silver ladder out of sight. Harry was
now the only person left to be tested. He settled himself on the floor with his
back against the wall, listening to a fly buzzing in the sunny window, his
mind across the grounds with Hagrid.
Finally, after about twenty minutes, Ron’s large feet reappeared on the
ladder.
“How’d it go?” Harry asked him, standing up.
“Rubbish,” said Ron. “Couldn’t see a thing, so I made some stuff up. Don’t
think she was convinced, though. . . .”
“Meet you in the common room,” Harry muttered as Professor Trelawney’s
voice called, “Harry Potter!”
The tower room was hotter than ever before; the curtains were closed, the
fire was alight, and the usual sickly scent made Harry cough as he stumbledthrough the clutter of chairs and tables to where Professor Trelawney sat
waiting for him before a larg denly brisk, “how are you to win my fabulous
prize? Well, by turning to page ten of 
Advanced Potion-Making.
 We have a
little over an hour left to us, which should be time for you to make a decent
attempt at the Draught of Living Death. I know it is more complex than
anything you have attempted before, and I do not expect a perfect potion from
anybody. The person who does best, however, will win little Felix here. Off
you go!”
There was a scraping as everyone drew their cauldrons toward them andsome loud clunks as people began adding weights to their scales, but nobody
spoke. The concentration within the room was almost tangible. Harry saw
Malfoy riffling feverishly through his copy of 
Advanced Potion-Making.
 It
could not have been clearer that Malfoy really wanted that lucky day. Harry
bent swiftly over the tattered book Slughorn had lent him.
To his annoyance he saw that the previous owner had scribbled all over the
pages, so that the margins were as black as the printed portions. Bending low
to decipher hen
the Slytherins and Gryffindors were halfway through double Potions.
He swaggered into the dungeon, his right arm covered in bandages and bound
up in a sling, acting, in Harry’s opinion, as though he were the heroic survivor
of some dreadful battle.
“How is it, Draco?” simpered Pansy Parkinson. “Does it hurt much?”
“Yeah,” said Malfoy, putting on a brave sort of grimace. But Harry saw him
wink at Crabbe and Goyle when Pansy had looked away.
“Settle down, settle down,” said Professor Snape idly.
Harry and Ron scowled at each other; Snape wouldn’t have said “settle
down” if 
they’d
 walked in late, he’d have given them detention. But Malfoy
had always been able to get away with anything in Snape’s classes; Snape was
head of Slytherin House, and generally favored his own students above all
others.
They were making a new potion today, a Shrinking Solution. Malfoy set up
his cauldron right next to Harry and Ron, so that they were preparing their
ingredients on the same table.“Sir,” Malfoy called, “sir, I’ll nee"

bed and out-of-bounds by Filch the caretaker in the middle of the night once
before, and had no desire to repeat the experience. The Invisibility Cloak
would, of course, be essential, and as an added precaution, Harry thought he
would take the Marauder’s Map, which, next to the Cloak, was the most
useful aid to rule-breaking Harry owned. The map showed the whole of
Hogwarts, including its many shortcuts and secret passageways and, most
important of all, it revealed the people inside the castle as minuscule, labeled
dots, moving around the corridors, so that Harry would be forewarned if
somebody was approaching the bathroom.
On Thursday night, Harry sneaked up to bed, put on the Cloak, crept backdownstairs, and, just as he had done on the night when Hagrid had shown him
the dragons, waited for the portrait hole to open. This time it was Ron who
waited outside to give the Fat Lady the password (“banana fritters”). “Good
luck,” Ron muttered, climbing into t M

It was a map showing every detail of the Hogwarts castle and grounds. But
the truly remarkable thing were the tiny ink dots moving around it, each
labeled with a name in minuscule writing. Astounded, Harry bent over it. A
labeled dot in the top left corner showed that Professor Dumbledore was
pacing his study; the caretaker’s cat, Mrs. Norris, was prowling the second
floor; and Peeves the Poltergeist was currently bouncing around the trophy
room. And as Harry’s eyes traveled up and down the familiar corridors, he
noticed something else.
This map showed a set of passages he had never entered. And many of
them seemed to lead —
“Right into Hogsmeade,” said Fred, tracing one of them with his finger.
“There are seven in all. Now, Filch knows about these four” — he pointed
them out — “but we’re sure we’re the only ones who know about 
these.
 Don’t
bother with the one behind the mirror on the fourth floor. We used it until last
winter, but it’s caved in — completely blocked. And we don’t reckon
an sion on Ron’s
face. Harry strode off through the heather, walking in a large circle with the
distraught Hermione at its center, casting the spells she usually performed to
ensure their protection.
They did not discuss Ron at all over the next few days. Harry was
determined never to mention his name again, and Hermione seemed to know
that it was no use forcing the issue, although sometimes at night when she
thought he was sleeping, he would hear her crying. Meanwhile Harry had
started bringing out the Marauder’s Map and examining it by wandlight. He
was waiting for the moment when Ron’s labeled dot would reappear in the
corridors of Hogwarts, proving that he had returned to the comfortable castle,
protected by his status of pureblood. However, Ron did not appear on the
map, and after a while Harry found himself taking it out simply to stare at
Ginny’s name in the girls’ dormitory, wondering whether the intensity with
which he gazed at it might break into her sleep, that she would somehow
know he was thinking a been disappearing off the map
— come to think of it, I’ve never seen the Room of Requirement on there!”
“Maybe the Marauders never knew the room was there,” said Ron.
“I think it’ll be part of the magic of the room,” said Hermione. “If you need
it to be Unplottable, it will be.”
“Dobby, have you managed to get in to have a look at what Malfoy’s
doing?” said Harry eagerly.
“No, Harry Potter, that is impossible,” said Dobby.
“No, it’s not,” said Harry at once. “Malfoy got into our headquarters there
last year, so I’ll be able to get in and spy on him, no problem.”
“But I don’t think you will, Harry,” said Hermione slowly. “Malfoy already
knew exactly how we were using the room, didn’t he, because that stupid
Marietta had blabbed. He needed the room to become the headquarters of the
D.A., so it did. But you don’t know what the room becomes when Malfoy
goes in there, so you don’t know what to ask it to transform into.”
“There’ll be a way around that,” said Harry dismissively. “You’ve done
brilliantly, Dobby.”
“Kr ” said Harry. He dropped his voice so that none of the
sixth years could hear him and told them all about the Marauder’s Map.
“How come Fred and George never gave it to 
me
!”
 
said Ron, outraged.
“I’m their brother!”
“But Harry isn’t going to keep it!” said Hermione, as though the idea were
ludicrous. “He’s going to hand it in to Professor McGonagall, aren’t you,
Harry?”
“No, I’m not!” said Harry.
“Are you mad?” said Ron, goggling at Hermione. “Hand in something that
good?”
“If I hand it in, I’ll have to say where I got it! Filch would know Fred and
George had nicked it!”
“But what about Sirius Black?” Hermione hissed. “He could be using one
of the passages on that map to get into the castle! The teachers have got to
know!”
“He can’t be getting in through a passage,” said Harry quickly. “There are
seven secret tunnels on the map, right? Fred and George reckon Filch already
knows about four of them. And of the other three — one of them’s caved in,
so no one can get through it. One of them’s got the Whomping  Invisibility Cloak and
throwing it over both of them. He gave the wall a little push.
It melted away at his touch and they slipped outside: Harry glanced back
and saw that it had resealed itself at once. They were standing in a dark
corridor: Harry pulled Luna back into the shadows, fumbled in the pouch
around his neck, and took out the Marauder’s Map. Holding it close to his
nose he searched, and located his and Luna’s dots at last.
“We’re up on the fifth floor,” he whispered, watching Filch moving away
from them, a corridor ahead. “Come on, this way.”
They crept off.
Harry had prowled the castle at night many times before, but never had his
heart hammered this fast, never had so much depended on his safe passage
through the place. Through squares of moonlight upon the floor, past suits of
armor whose helmets creaked at the sound of their soft footsteps, around
corners beyond which who knew what lurked, Harry and Luna walked,
checking the Marauder’s Map whenever light permitted, twice pausing toallow a ghost might try and sneak out of the castle
to visit Hagrid before his hippogriff was executed. And I was right, wasn’t I?”
He had started to pace up and down, looking at them. Little patches of dust
rose at his feet.
“You might have been wearing your father’s old Cloak, Harry —”“How d’you know about the Cloak?”
“The number of times I saw James disappearing under it . . . ,” said Lupin,
waving an impatient hand again. “The point is, even if you’re wearing an
Invisibility Cloak, you still show up on the Marauder’s Map. I watched you
cross the grounds and enter Hagrid’s hut. Twenty minutes later, you left
Hagrid, and set off back toward the castle. But you were now accompanied by
somebody else.”
“What?” said Harry. “No, we weren’t!”
“I couldn’t believe my eyes,” said Lupin, still pacing, and ignoring Harry’s
interruption. “I thought the map must be malfunctioning. How could he be
with you?”
“No one was with us!” said Harry.
“And then I saw another dot, moving fast toward you, labeled 
Sirius
Black
. . . . I saw him c ed, and Harry caught him and pushed him back down
to the bed. Then, ignoring Black, Harry turned to Lupin.
“There were witnesses who saw Pettigrew die,” he said. “A whole street
full of them . . .”
“They didn’t see what they thought they saw!” said Black savagely, still
watching Scabbers struggling in Ron’s hands.
“Everyone thought Sirius killed Peter,” said Lupin, nodding. “I believed it
myself — until I saw the map tonight. Because the Marauder’s Map never
lies . . . Peter’s alive. Ron’s holding him, Harry.”
Harry looked down at Ron, and as their eyes met, they agreed, silently:
Black and Lupin were both out of their minds. Their story made no sense
whatsoever. How could Scabbers be Peter Pettigrew? Azkaban must have
unhinged Black after all — but why was Lupin playing along with him?
Then Hermione spoke, in a trembling, would-be calm sort of voice, as
though trying to will Professor Lupin to talk sensibly.
“But Professor Lupin . . . Scabbers can’t be Pettigrew . . . it just can’t be
true, you know it can’t"
Who is the Triwizard champion from Beauxbatons?,Fleur Delacour,The Triwizard champion from Beauxbatons is Miss Fleur Delacour.,"oke. Nearly everyone laughed, and Dumbledore chuckled appreciatively.
“I am 
not
 joking, Mr. Weasley,” he said, “though now that you mention it, I
did hear an excellent one over the summer about a troll, a hag, and a
leprechaun who all go into a bar . . .”
Professor McGonagall cleared her throat loudly.
“Er — but maybe this is not the time . . . no . . .” said Dumbledore, “where
was I? Ah yes, the Triwizard Tournament . . . well, some of you will not know
what this tournament involves, so I hope those who 
do
 know will forgive me
for giving a short explanation, and allow their attention to wander freely.
“The Triwizard Tournament was first established some seven hundred years
ago as a friendly competition between the three largest European schools of
wizardry: Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, and Durmstrang. A champion was selected
to represent each school, and the three champions competed in three magical
tasks. The schools took it in turns to host the tournament once every five
years, and it was generally agreed to directions, to station themselves around the maze. Bagman now
pointed his wand at his throat, muttered, 
“Sonorus,”
 and his magically
magnified voice echoed into the stands.
“Ladies and gentlemen, the third and final task of the Triwizard
Tournament is about to begin! Let me remind you how the points currently
stand! Tied in first place, with eighty-five points each — Mr. Cedric Diggory
and Mr. Harry Potter, both of Hogwarts School!” The cheers and applause
sent birds from the Forbidden Forest fluttering into the darkening sky. “In
second place, with eighty points — Mr. Viktor Krum, of Durmstrang
Institute!” More applause. “And in third place — Miss Fleur Delacour, of
Beauxbatons Academy!”
Harry could just make out Mrs. Weasley, Bill, Ron, and Hermione
applauding Fleur politely, halfway up the stands. He waved up at them, and
they waved back, beaming at him.
“So . . . on my whistle, Harry and Cedric!” said Bagman. “Three — two —
one —”
He gave a short blast on his whistle, and Harry and Cedric hurried forwar g
champion.
Predictably, Malfoy arrived at Hagrid’s cabin with his familiar sneer firmly
in place.
“Ah, look, boys, it’s the champion,” he said to Crabbe and Goyle themoment he got within earshot of Harry. “Got your autograph books? Better
get a signature now, because I doubt he’s going to be around much longer. . . .
Half the Triwizard champions have died . . . how long d’you reckon you’re
going to last, Potter? Ten minutes into the first task’s my bet.”
Crabbe and Goyle guffawed sycophantically, but Malfoy had to stop there,
because Hagrid emerged from the back of his cabin balancing a teetering
tower of crates, each containing a very large Blast-Ended Skrewt. To the
class’s horror, Hagrid proceeded to explain that the reason the skrewts had
been killing one another was an excess of pent-up energy, and that the
solution would be for each student to fix a leash on a skrewt and take it for a
short walk. The only good thing about this plan was that it distracted Malfoy
completely.
“Take this thing for a walk?”  guide Harry Potter through the Triwizard Tournament without
appearing to do so. A servant who would watch over Harry Potter. Ensure he
reached the Triwizard Cup. Turn the Cup into a Portkey, which would take the
first person to touch it to my master. But first —”
“You needed Alastor Moody,” said Dumbledore. His blue eyes were
blazing, though his voice remained calm.
“Wormtail and I did it. We had prepared the Polyjuice Potion beforehand.
We journeyed to his house. Moody put up a struggle. There was a commotion.
We managed to subdue him just in time. Forced him into a compartment of
his own magical trunk. Took some of his hair and added it to the potion. I
drank it; I became Moody’s double. I took his leg and his eye. I was ready to
face Arthur Weasley when he arrived to sort out the Muggles who had heard a
disturbance. I made the dustbins move around the yard. I told Arthur Weasley
I had heard intruders in my yard, who had set off the dustbins. Then I packed
up Moody’s clothes and Dark Detectors, put them in ontenders in October, and the selection of the three champions
will take place at Halloween. An impartial judge will decide which students
are most worthy to compete for the Triwizard Cup, the glory of their school,
and a thousand Galleons personal prize money.”
“I’m going for it!” Fred Weasley hissed down the table, his face lit with
enthusiasm at the prospect of such glory and riches. He was not the only
person who seemed to be visualizing himself as the Hogwarts champion. At
every House table, Harry could see people either gazing raptly at
Dumbledore, or else whispering fervently to their neighbors. But then
Dumbledore spoke again, and the Hall quieted once more.
“Eager though I know all of you will be to bring the Triwizard Cup to
Hogwarts,” he said, “the Heads of the participating schools, along with the
Ministry of Magic, have agreed to impose an age restriction on contenders
this year. Only students who are of age — that is to say, seventeen years or
older — will be allowed to put forward their names f of them were.
There was a sound of scurrying feet behind him, and Ludo Bagman entered
the room. He took Harry by the arm and led him forward.“Extraordinary!” he muttered, squeezing Harry’s arm. “Absolutely
extraordinary! Gentlemen . . . lady,” he added, approaching the fireside and
addressing the other three. “May I introduce — incredible though it may seem
— the 
fourth
 Triwizard champion?”
Viktor Krum straightened up. His surly face darkened as he surveyed
Harry. Cedric looked nonplussed. He looked from Bagman to Harry and back
again as though sure he must have misheard what Bagman had said. Fleur
Delacour, however, tossed her hair, smiling, and said, “Oh, vairy funny joke,
Meester Bagman.”
“Joke?” Bagman repeated, bewildered. “No, no, not at all! Harry’s name
just came out of the Goblet of Fire!”
Krum’s thick eyebrows contracted slightly. Cedric was still looking politely
bewildered. Fleur frowned.
“But evidently zair ’as been a mistake,” she said contemptuously to
Bagman. “’E cannot compete. ’E is too yo ance of the sign in the entrance hall had a marked effect upon
the inhabitants of the castle. During the following week, there seemed to be
only one topic of conversation, no matter where Harry went: the Triwizard
Tournament. Rumors were flying from student to student like highly
contagious germs: who was going to try for Hogwarts champion, what the
tournament would involve, how the students from Beauxbatons and
Durmstrang differed from themselves.
Harry noticed too that the castle seemed to be undergoing an extra-
thorough cleaning. Several grimy portraits had been scrubbed, much to the
displeasure of their subjects, who sat huddled in their frames muttering darkly
and wincing as they felt their raw pink faces. The suits of armor were
suddenly gleaming and moving without squeaking, and Argus Filch, thecaretaker, was behaving so ferociously to any students who forgot to wipe
their shoes that he terrified a pair of first-year girls into hysterics.
Other members of the staff seemed oddly tense too.
“Longbottom, .
Dear Sirius,
You told me to keep you posted on what’s happening at Hogwarts,
so here goes — 
I don’t know if you’ve heard, but the Triwizard
Tournament’s happening this year and on Saturday night I got
picked as a fourth champion. I don’t know who put my name in the
Goblet of Fire, because I didn’t. The other Hogwarts champion is
Cedric Diggory, from Hufflepuff.
He paused at this point, thinking. He had an urge to say something about
the large weight of anxiety that seemed to have settled inside his chest since
last night, but he couldn’t think how to translate this into words, so he simply
dipped his quill back into the ink bottle and wrote,
 
Hope you’re okay, and Buckbeak — 
“Finished,” he told Hermione, getting to his feet and brushing straw off his
robes. At this, Hedwig came fluttering down onto his shoulder and held out
her leg.
“I can’t use you,” Harry told her, looking around for the school owls. “I’ve
got to use one of these. . . .”
Hedwig gave a very loud hoot and took off so suddenly that her ta"

“You see?” he whispered. “It was a name I was already using at Hogwarts,
to my most intimate friends only, of course. You think I was going to use my
filthy Muggle father’s name forever? I, in whose veins runs the blood of
Salazar Slytherin himself, through my mother’s side? I, keep the name of a
foul, common Muggle, who abandoned me even before I was born, just
because he found out his wife was a witch? No, Harry — I fashioned myself a
new name, a name I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak,when I had become the greatest sorcerer in the world!”
Harry’s brain seemed to have jammed. He stared numbly at Riddle, at the
orphaned boy who had grown up to murder Harry’s own parents, and so many
others. . . . At last he forced himself to speak.
“You’re not,” he said, his quiet voice full of hatred.
“Not what?” snapped Riddle.
“Not the greatest sorcerer in the world,” said Harry, breathing fast. “Sorry
to disappoint you and all that, but the grea self an impressive new
name — 
Lord
 Voldemort — the Half-Blood 
Prince —

have missed — ?”
He broke off, looking out the window. He could not stop himself dwelling
upon Dumbledore’s inexcusable trust in Snape . . . but as Hermione had just
inadvertently reminded him, he, Harry, had been taken in just the same. . . . Inspite of the increasing nastiness of those scribbled spells, he had refused to
believe ill of the boy who had been so clever, who had helped him so
much. . . .
Helped him
 . . . it was an almost unendurable thought now.
“I still don’t get why he didn’t turn you in for using that book,” said Ron.
“He must’ve known where you were getting it all from.”
“He knew,” said Harry bitterly. “He knew when I used Sectumsempra. He
didn’t really need Legilimency. . . . He might even have known before then,
with Slughorn talking about how brilliant I was at Potions. . . . Shouldn’t have
left his old book in the bottom of that cupboard, should he?”
“But why didn’t he turn you in?”
“I don’t pose he really

 gone, Dumbledore?”
“It certainly seems so,” said Dumbledore. “We have much to be thankful
for. Would you care for a lemon drop?”
“A 
what
?”
“A lemon drop. They’re a kind of Muggle sweet I’m rather fond of.”
“No, thank you,” said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though she didn’t
think this was the moment for lemon drops. “As I say, even if You-Know-
Who 
has
 gone —”“My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by
his name? All this ‘You-Know-Who’ nonsense — for eleven years I have
been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name: 
Voldemort.
”
Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two
lemon drops, seemed not to notice. “It all gets so confusing if we keep saying
‘You-Know-Who.’ I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying
Voldemort’s name.”
“I know you haven’t,” said Professor McGonagall, sounding half
exasperated, half admiring. “But you’re different. Everyone knows you’re the
only one You-Know- oh, all right,  
their charges’ youthful beginnings.”
He raised his glass as though toasting Voldemort, whose face remained
expressionless. Nevertheless, Harry felt the atmosphere in the room change
subtly: Dumbledore’s refusal to use Voldemort’s chosen name was a refusal to
allow Voldemort to dictate the terms of the meeting, and Harry could tell that
Voldemort took it as such.
“I am surprised you have remained here so long,” said Voldemort after a
short pause. “I always wondered why a wizard such as yourself never wished
to leave school.”
“Well,” said Dumbledore, still smiling, “to a wizard such as myself, there
can be nothing more important than passing on ancient skills, helping hone
young minds. If I remember correctly, you once saw the attraction of teaching
too.”
“I see it still,” said Voldemort. “I merely wondered why you — who are so
often asked for advice by the Ministry, and who have twice, I think, been
offered the post of Minister —”
“Three times at the last count, actually,” said Dumbledore. “But the
Ministry n of my late father,” he hissed
softly. “A Muggle and a fool . . . very like your dear mother. But they both
had their uses, did they not? Your mother died to defend you as a child . . .
and I killed my father, and see how useful he has proved himself, in
death. . . .”
Voldemort laughed again. Up and down he paced, looking all around him
as he walked, and the snake continued to circle in the grass.“You see that house upon the hillside, Potter? My father lived there. My
mother, a witch who lived here in this village, fell in love with him. But he
abandoned her when she told him what she was. . . . He didn’t like magic, my
father . . .
“He left her and returned to his Muggle parents before I was even born,
Potter, and she died giving birth to me, leaving me to be raised in a Muggle
orphanage . . . but I vowed to find him . . . I revenged myself upon him, that
fool who gave me his name . . .

Still he paced, his red eyes darting from grave to grave.

said Sirius.
“But as he was the one who saw Voldemort come back” (again, there was a
collective shudder around the table at the name), “he has more right than most
to —”
“He’s not a member of the Order of the Phoenix!” said Mrs. Weasley. “He’s
only fifteen and —”
“— and he’s dealt with as much as most in the Order,” said Sirius, “and
more than some —”
“No one’s denying what he’s done!” said Mrs. Weasley, her voice rising,
her fists trembling on the arms of her chair. “But he’s still —”
“He’s not a child!” said Sirius impatiently.
“He’s not an adult either!” said Mrs. Weasley, the color rising in her
cheeks. “He’s not 
James, 
Sirius!”
“I’m perfectly clear who he is, thanks, Molly,” said Sirius coldly.
“I’m not sure you are!” said Mrs. Weasley. “Sometimes, the way you talk
about him, it’s as though you think you’ve got your best friend back!”
“What’s wrong with that?” said Harry.
“What’s wrong, Harry, is that you are 
not
 your father, however much you
might look like him!” s d have found
those names in old reports of the trials! For heaven’s sake, Dumbledore — the
boy was full of some crackpot story at the end of last year too — his tales are
getting taller, and you’re still swallowing them — the boy can talk to snakes,
Dumbledore, and you still think he’s trustworthy?”
“You fool!” Professor McGonagall cried. “Cedric Diggory! Mr. Crouch!
These deaths were not the random work of a lunatic!”
“I see no evidence to the contrary!” shouted Fudge, now matching her
anger, his face purpling. “It seems to me that you are all determined to start a
panic that will destabilize everything we have worked for these last thirteen
years!”
Harry couldn’t believe what he was hearing. He had always thought of
Fudge as a kindly figure, a little blustering, a little pompous, but essentially
good-natured. But now a short, angry wizard stood before him, refusing,
point-blank, to accept the prospect of disruption in his comfortable and
ordered world — to believe that Voldemort could have risen.
“Voldemort It’s him . . . it’s the real one. . . . 
They
had said it right after he had tried to Disarm Stan. . . .“We’re nearly there, Harry, we’ve nearly made it!” shouted Hagrid.
Harry felt the bike drop a little, though the lights down on the ground still
seemed remote as stars.
Then the scar on his forehead burned like fire; as a Death Eater appeared
on either side of the bike, two Killing Curses missed Harry by millimeters,
cast from behind —
And then Harry saw him. Voldemort was flying like smoke on the wind,
without broomstick or thestral to hold him, his snakelike face gleaming out of
the blackness, his white fingers raising his wand again —
Hagrid let out a bellow of fear and steered the motorbike into a vertical
dive. Clinging on for dear life, Harry sent Stunning Spells flying at random
into the whirling night. He saw a body fly past him and knew he had hit one
of them, but then he heard a bang and saw sparks from the engine; the
motorbike spiraled through the air, completely out of control —
Green jets of l"
What spell is used to produce light from a wand?,Lumos,The spell used to produce light from a wand is Lumos.," lighting his own wand hastily as he went.
An eerie sight met their eyes: They were standing on the edge of a great
black lake, so vast that Harry could not make out the distant banks, in a
cavern so high that the ceiling too was out of sight. A misty greenish light
shone far away in what looked like the middle of the lake; it was reflected in
the completely still water below. The greenish glow and the light from the
two wands were the only things that broke the otherwise velvety blackness,
though their rays did not penetrate as far as Harry would have expected. The
darkness was somehow denser than normal darkness.
“Let us walk,” said Dumbledore quietly. “Be very careful not to step into
the water. Stay close to me.”
He set off around the edge of the lake, and Harry followed close behind
him. Their footsteps made echoing, slapping sounds on the narrow rim of
rock that surrounded the water. On and on they walked, but the view did notvary: on one side of them, the rough cavern wall, on the other, the boundless
 ing Voldemort.
Voldemort was ready. As Harry shouted, 
“Expelliarmus!”
 Voldemort cried,
“Avada Kedavra!”
A jet of green light issued from Voldemort’s wand just as a jet of red light
blasted from Harry’s — they met in midair — and suddenly Harry’s wand
was vibrating as though an electric charge were surging through it; his hand
seized up around it; he couldn’t have released it if he’d wanted to — and a
narrow beam of light connected the two wands, neither red nor green, but
bright, deep gold. Harry, following the beam with his astonished gaze, saw
that Voldemort’s long white fingers too were gripping a wand that was
shaking and vibrating.
And then — nothing could have prepared Harry for this — he felt his feet
lift from the ground. He and Voldemort were both being raised into the air,
their wands still connected by that thread of shimmering golden light. They
glided away from the tombstone of Voldemort’s father and then came to rest
on a patch of ground that was clear and free of graves. . . . The Death Eater 
hands in the pockets of his robes.
“Hmm,” said Mr. Ollivander, “this is a Gregorovitch creation, unless I’m
much mistaken? A fine wandmaker, though the styling is never quite what
I . . . however . . .”
He lifted the wand and examined it minutely, turning it over and over
before his eyes.
“Yes . . . hornbeam and dragon heartstring?” he shot at Krum, who nodded.
“Rather thicker than one usually sees . . . quite rigid . . . ten and a quarter
inches . . . 
Avis!
”
The hornbeam wand let off a blast like a gun, and a number of small,
twittering birds flew out of the end and through the open window into the
watery sunlight.
“Good,” said Mr. Ollivander, handing Krum back his wand. “Which
leaves . . . Mr. Potter.”
Harry got to his feet and walked past Krum to Mr. Ollivander. He handed
over his wand.
“Aaaah, yes,” said Mr. Ollivander, his pale eyes suddenly gleaming. “Yes,
yes, yes. How well I remember.”
Harry could remember too. He could remember it as though it had
happened yesterday. . . .
Four summers ago, on his nted mirror, and R.A.B.’s locket. He pulled the strings
tight and slipped the purse around his neck, then sat holding the old Snitch
and watching its wings flutter feebly. At last, Hermione tapped on the door
and tiptoed inside.
“Muffliato,”
 she whispered, waving her wand in the direction of the stairs.
“Thought you didn’t approve of that spell?” said Ron.
“Times change,” said Hermione. “Now, show us that Deluminator.”
Ron obliged at once. Holding it up in front of him, he clicked it. The
solitary lamp they had lit went out at once.
“The thing is,” whispered Hermione through the dark, “we could have
achieved that with Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder.”
There was a small 
click,
 and the ball of light from the lamp flew back to the
ceiling and illuminated them all once more.
“Still, it’s cool,” said Ron, a little defensively. “And from what they said,
Dumbledore invented it himself!”
“I know, but surely he wouldn’t have singled you out in his will just to help
us turn out the lights!”“D’you think he knew the  lt a creeping chill behind him that could mean only
one thing. There was more than one.
“DUDLEY, KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT! WHATEVER YOU DO,
KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT! Wand!” Harry muttered frantically, his hands
flying over the ground like spiders. “Where’s — wand — come on —
Lumos!
”
He said the spell automatically, desperate for light to help him in his search
— and to his disbelieving relief, light flared inches from his right hand — the
wand-tip had ignited. Harry snatched it up, scrambled to his feet, and turned
around.
His stomach turned over.
A towering, hooded figure was gliding smoothly toward him, hovering over
the ground, no feet or face visible beneath its robes, sucking on the night as it
came.Stumbling backward, Harry raised his wand.
“Expecto Patronum!”
A silvery wisp of vapor shot from the tip of the wand and the dementor
slowed, but the spell hadn’t worked properly; tripping over his feet, Harry
retreated farther as the dementor bore down upon him, panic fogging his brain

A pair of g bead of light right back into Voldemort’s wand . . . and slowly . . .
very slowly . . . it moved along the golden thread . . . it trembled for a
moment . . . and then it connected. . . .
At once, Voldemort’s wand began to emit echoing screams of pain . . . then
— Voldemort’s red eyes widened with shock — a dense, smoky hand flew out
of the tip of it and vanished . . . the ghost of the hand he had made
Wormtail . . . more shouts of pain . . . and then something much larger began
to blossom from Voldemort’s wand-tip, a great, grayish something, that
looked as though it were made of the solidest, densest smoke. . . . It was a
head . . . now a chest and arms . . . the torso of Cedric Diggory.
If ever Harry might have released his wand from shock, it would have been
then, but instinct kept him clutching his wand tightly, so that the thread of
golden light remained unbroken, even though the thick gray ghost of Cedric
Diggory (
was
 it a ghost? it looked so solid) emerged in its entirety from the
end of Voldemort’s  e lightning scar on Harry’s forehead with a long,
white finger.
“I’m sorry to say I sold the wand that did it,” he said softly. “Thirteen-and-
a-half inches. Yew. Powerful wand, very powerful, and in the wrong
hands . . . well, if I’d known what that wand was going out into the world to
do. . . .”
He shook his head and then, to Harry’s relief, spotted Hagrid.
“Rubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you again. . . . Oak, sixteen
inches, rather bendy, wasn’t it?”
“It was, sir, yes,” said Hagrid.“Good wand, that one. But I suppose they snapped it in half when you got
expelled?” said Mr. Ollivander, suddenly stern.
“Er — yes, they did, yes,” said Hagrid, shuffling his feet. “I’ve still got the
pieces, though,” he added brightly.
“But you don’t use them?” said Mr. Ollivander sharply.
“Oh, no, sir,” said Hagrid quickly. Harry noticed he gripped his pink
umbrella very tightly as he spoke.
“Hmmm,” said Mr. Ollivander, giving Hagrid a piercing look. “Well, now
— Mr. Potter. Let me see.” He pulled a long tape measure w rd him once
more, and he broke into a run, a question burning in him, but as he opened his
lips to ask it, she vanished.
Though the darkness had swallowed her whole, her burnished image was
still imprinted on his retinas; it obscured his vision, brightening when he
lowered his eyelids, disorienting him. Now fear came: Her presence had
meant safety.
“Lumos!”
 he whispered, and the wand-tip ignited.
The imprint of the doe faded away with every blink of his eyes as he stood
there, listening to the sounds of the forest, to distant crackles of twigs, soft
swishes of snow. Was he about to be attacked? Had she enticed him into an
ambush? Was he imagining that somebody stood beyond the reach of the
wandlight, watching him?
He held the wand higher. Nobody ran out at him, no flash of green light
burst from behind a tree. Why, then, had she led him to this spot?
Something gleamed in the light of the wand, and Harry spun about, but all
that was there was a small, frozen pool, its cracked black surface glittering as

“What 
was
 that?”
“It was either a very big cat or quite a small tiger,” said Harry.
“Where’s Hermione?”
“Probably getting her owl —”
They made their way back up the crowded street to the Magical Menagerie.
As they reached it, Hermione came out, but she wasn’t carrying an owl. Her
arms were clamped tightly around the enormous ginger cat.
“You 
bought
 that monster?” said Ron, his mouth hanging open.
“He’s 
gorgeous,
 isn’t he?” said Hermione, glowing.
That was a matter of opinion, thought Harry. The cat’s ginger fur was thick
and fluffy, but it was definitely a bit bowlegged and its face looked grumpy
and oddly squashed, as though it had run headlong into a brick wall. Now that
Scabbers was out of sight, however, the cat was purring contentedly in
Hermione’s arms.
“Hermione, that thing nearly scalped me!” said Ron.
“He didn’t mean to, did you, Crookshanks?” said Hermione.
“And what about Scabbers?” said Ron, pointing at the lump in his chest
pocket. “He needs rest and relaxation! How’s he g y had only gone a few paces when Hermione’s bandy-legged ginger
cat, Crookshanks, came pelting out of the garden, bottlebrush tail held high in
the air, chasing what looked like a muddy potato on legs. Harry recognized it
instantly as a gnome. Barely ten inches high, its horny little feet pattered very
fast as it sprinted across the yard and dived headlong into one of the
Wellington boots that lay scattered around the door. Harry could hear the
gnome giggling madly as Crookshanks inserted a paw into the boot, trying to
reach it. Meanwhile, a very loud crashing noise was coming from the other
side of the house. The source of the commotion was revealed as they entered
the garden, and saw that Bill and Charlie both had their wands out, and were
making two battered old tables fly high above the lawn, smashing into each
other, each attempting to knock the other’s out of the air. Fred and George
were cheering, Ginny was laughing, and Hermione was hovering near the
hedge, apparently torn between amusement and anxiet  you still got Millicent’s nose or
something?”
Hermione let her robes fall and Ron backed into the sink.
Her face was covered in black fur. Her eyes had turned yellow and there
were long, pointed ears poking through her hair.
“It was a c-cat hair!” she howled. “M-Millicent Bulstrode m-must have a
cat! And the p-potion isn’t supposed to be used for animal transformations!”
“Uh-oh,” said Ron.
“You’ll be teased something 
dreadful
,” said Myrtle happily.
“It’s okay, Hermione,” said Harry quickly. “We’ll take you up to the
hospital wing. Madam Pomfrey never asks too many questions. . . .”
It took a long time to persuade Hermione to leave the bathroom. Moaning
Myrtle sped them on their way with a hearty guffaw. “Wait till everyone finds
out you’ve got a

THE VERY SECRET DIARY

flurry of rumor about her disappearance when the rest of the school
arrived back from their Christmas holidays, because of course everyone
thoug front
spotted the hanging cat. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood alone, in the middle
of the corridor, as silence fell among the mass of students pressing forward to
see the grisly sight.
Then someone shouted through the quiet.
“Enemies of the Heir, beware! You’ll be next, Mudbloods!”
It was Draco Malfoy. He had pushed to the front of the crowd, his cold eyes
alive, his usually bloodless face flushed, as he grinned at the sight of the
hanging, immobile cat.W
 
CHAPTER  NINE
THE WRITING ON THE WALL
hat’s going on here? What’s going on?”
Attracted no doubt by Malfoy’s shout, Argus Filch came
shouldering his way through the crowd. Then he saw Mrs. Norris and fell
back, clutching his face in horror.
“My cat! My cat! What’s happened to Mrs. Norris?” he shrieked.
And his popping eyes fell on Harry.
“You!”
 he screeched. “
You!
 You’ve murdered my cat! You’ve killed her!
I’ll kill you! I’ll —”
“Argus!”
Dumbledore had arrived on the scene, followed by a number of other
teachers. In seconds, he had swept past Harry, Ron, anks doesn’t understand it’s wrong!” said Hermione, her voice
shaking. “All cats chase rats, Ron!”
“There’s something funny about that animal!” said Ron, who was trying to
persuade a frantically wiggling Scabbers back into his pocket. “It heard me
say that Scabbers was in my bag!”
“Oh, what rubbish,” said Hermione impatiently. “Crookshanks could 
smell
him, Ron, how else d’you think —”
“That cat’s got it in for Scabbers!” said Ron, ignoring the people around
him, who were starting to giggle. “And Scabbers was here first, 
and
 he’s ill!”
Ron marched through the common room and out of sight up the stairs to
the boys’ dormitories.
Ron was still in a bad mood with Hermione next day. He barely talked to her
all through Herbology, even though he, Harry, and Hermione were working
together on the same puffapod.
“How’s Scabbers?” Hermione asked timidly as they stripped fat pink pods
from the plants and emptied the shining beans into a wooden pail.
“He’s hiding at the bottom of my bed, shaking,” said Ron angrily, miss for the use of magic in life-threatening situations —”
“Let him breathe, Hermione,” said Ron, grinning, closing the door behind
Harry. He seemed to have grown several more inches during their month
apart, making him taller and more gangly looking than ever, though the long
nose, bright red hair, and freckles were the same.
Hermione, still beaming, let go of Harry, but before she could say another
word there was a soft whooshing sound and something white soared from the
top of a dark wardrobe and landed gently on Harry’s shoulder.
“Hedwig!”
The snowy owl clicked her beak and nibbled his ear affectionately as Harry
stroked her feathers.
“She’s been in a right state,” said Ron. “Pecked us half to death when shebrought your last letters, look at this —”
He showed Harry the index finger of his right hand, which sported a half-
healed but clearly deep cut.
“Oh yeah,” Harry said. “Sorry about that, but I wanted answers, you
know . . .”
“We wanted to give them to you, mate,” said Ron. “Hermione was going

“What?” said Harry.
“Hermione,” said Hagrid.
“What about her?” said Ron.
“She’s in a righ’ state, that’s what. She’s bin comin’ down ter visit me a lotsince Chris’mas. Bin feelin’ lonely. Firs’ yeh weren’ talking to her because o’
the Firebolt, now yer not talkin’ to her because her cat —”
“— ate Scabbers!” Ron interjected angrily.
“Because her cat acted like all cats do,” Hagrid continued doggedly. “She’s
cried a fair few times, yeh know. Goin’ through a rough time at the moment.
Bitten off more’n she can chew, if yeh ask me, all the work she’s tryin’ ter do.
Still found time ter help me with Buckbeak’s case, mind. . . . She’s found
some really good stuff fer me . . . reckon he’ll stand a good chance now. . . .”
“Hagrid, we should’ve helped as well — sorry —” Harry began
awkwardly.
“I’m not blamin’ yeh!” said Hagrid, waving Harry’s apology aside. “Gawd

Quidditch ev’ry hour  what Harry recognized to be Skele-Gro. Hermione was
wrapped in a borrowed dressing gown, pale and unsteady on her feet; Ron put
an arm around her when she reached him. Luna, who was huddled in one of
Fleur’s coats, crouched down and placed her fingers tenderly upon each of the
elf’s eyelids, sliding them over his glassy stare.
“There,” she said softly. “Now he could be sleeping.”
Harry placed the elf into the grave, arranged his tiny limbs so that he might
have been resting, then climbed out and gazed for the last time upon the little
body. He forced himself not to break down as he remembered Dumbledore’s
funeral, and the rows and rows of golden chairs, and the Minister of Magic in
the front row, the recitation of Dumbledore’s achievements, the stateliness of
the white marble tomb. He felt that Dobby deserved just as grand a funeral,
and yet here the elf lay between bushes in a roughly dug hole.
“I think we ought to say something,” piped up Luna. “I’ll go first, shall I?”And as everybody looked at her, she ad"

“You needed Alastor Moody,” said Dumbledore. His blue eyes were
blazing, though his voice remained calm.
“Wormtail and I did it. We had prepared the Polyjuice Potion beforehand.
We journeyed to his house. Moody put up a struggle. There was a commotion.
We managed to subdue him just in time. Forced him into a compartment of
his own magical trunk. Took some of his hair and added it to the potion. I
drank it; I became Moody’s double. I took his leg and his eye. I was ready to
face Arthur Weasley when he arrived to sort out the Muggles who had heard a
disturbance. I made the dustbins move around the yard. I told Arthur Weasley
I had heard intruders in my yard, who had set off the dustbins. Then I packed
up Moody’s clothes and Dark Detectors, put them in as though he were trapped
in a nightmare. He was fully aware that even if, by some miracle, he managed
to find a suitable spell, he’d have a real job mastering it overnight. How could
he have let this happen? Why hadn’t he got to work on the egg’s clue sooner?
Why had he ever let his mind wander in class — what if a teacher had once
mentioned how to breathe underwater?
He sat with Hermione and Ron in the library as the sun set outside, tearing
feverishly through page after page of spells, hidden from one another by the
massive piles of books on the desk in front of each of them. Harry’s heart
gave a huge leap every time he saw the word “water” on a page, but more
often than not it was merely “Take two pints of water, half a pound of
shredded mandrake leaves, and a newt . . .”
“I don’t reckon it can be done,” said Ron’s voice flatly from the other side
of the table. “There’s nothing. 
Nothing.
 Closest was that thing to dry up
puddles and ponds, that Drought Charm, but that was nowhere near powerful
enough to   magical power. The part of him that
was still dry was covered in goose pimples; half immersed in the icy water, a
cruel breeze lifting his hair, Harry started to shiver violently. He avoided
looking at the stands; the laughter was becoming louder, and there were
catcalls and jeering from the Slytherins. . . .
Then, quite suddenly, Harry felt as though an invisible pillow had been
pressed over his mouth and nose. He tried to draw breath, but it made his head
spin; his lungs were empty, and he suddenly felt a piercing pain on either side
of his neck —
Harry clapped his hands around his throat and felt two large slits just below
his ears, flapping in the cold air. . . . 
He had gills.
 Without pausing to think, he
did the only thing that made sense — he flung himself forward into the water.The first gulp of icy lake water felt like the breath of life. His head had
stopped spinning; he took another great gulp of water and felt it pass
smoothly through his gills, sending oxygen back to his brain. He stretched out ore, as he reached the boulder closest to the cliff
face. A thousand flecks of golden light sparkled upon the dark surface of the
water a few feet below where he crouched; the black wall of rock beside him
was illuminated too.
“You see?” said Dumbledore quietly, holding his wand a little higher. Harry
saw a fissure in the cliff into which dark water was swirling.
“You will not object to getting a little wet?”
“No,” said Harry.
“Then take off your Invisibility Cloak — there is no need for it now — and
let us take the plunge.”
And with the sudden agility of a much younger man, Dumbledore slid from
the boulder, landed in the sea, and began to swim, with a perfect breaststroke,
toward the dark slit in the rock face, his lit wand held in his teeth. Harry
pulled off his Cloak, stuffed it into his pocket, and followed.
The water was icy; Harry’s waterlogged clothes billowed around him and
weighed him down. Taking deep breaths that filled his nostrils with the tang
of salt and seaweed, he struck out for the shimmerin 
 he shouted, jabbing the goblet with his wand.
The goblet filled with clear water; Harry dropped to his knees beside
Dumbledore, raised his head, and brought the glass to his lips — but it was
empty. Dumbledore groaned and began to pant.
“But I had some — wait — 
Aguamenti!
” said Harry again, pointing his
wand at the goblet. Once more, for a second, clear water gleamed within it,
but as he approached Dumbledore’s mouth, the water vanished again.“Sir, I’m trying, I’m trying!” said Harry desperately, but he did not think
that Dumbledore could hear him; he had rolled onto his side and was drawing
great, rattling breaths that sounded agonizing. 
“Aguamenti — Aguamenti —
AGUAMENTI!”
The goblet filled and emptied once more. And now Dumbledore’s
breathing was fading. His brain whirling in panic, Harry knew, instinctively,
the only way left to get water, because Voldemort had planned it so . . .
He flung himself over to the edge of the rock and plunged the goblet into
the lake, bringing it up full to the brim of ic d him.
“I’ve got to go and look for people who can’t use their voices above the
ground. . . .” he said slowly. “Er . . . who could that be?”
“Slow, aren’t you?”
He had never seen Moaning Myrtle so cheerful, apart from the day when a
dose of Polyjuice Potion had given Hermione the hairy face and tail of a cat.
Harry stared around the bathroom, thinking . . . if the voices could only be
heard underwater, then it made sense for them to belong to underwater
creatures. He ran this theory past Myrtle, who smirked at him.
“Well, that’s what Diggory thought,” she said. “He lay there talking to
himself for ages about it. Ages and ages . . . nearly all the bubbles had
gone. . . .”“Underwater . . .” Harry said slowly. “Myrtle . . . what lives in the lake,
apart from the giant squid?”
“Oh all sorts,” she said. “I sometimes go down there . . . sometimes don’t
have any choice, if someone flushes my toilet when I’m not expecting it. . . .”
Trying not to think about Moaning Myrtle zooming down a pipe to the lake
with the con problem facing him:
how to survive underwater for an hour on the twenty-fourth of February.
Ron quite liked the idea of using the Summoning Charm again — Harry
had explained about Aqua-Lungs, and Ron couldn’t see why Harry shouldn’t
Summon one from the nearest Muggle town. Hermione squashed this plan by
pointing out that, in the unlikely event that Harry managed to learn how to
operate an Aqua-Lung within the set limit of an hour, he was sure to be
disqualified for breaking the International Code of Wizarding Secrecy — it
was too much to hope that no Muggles would spot an Aqua-Lung zooming
across the countryside to Hogwarts.
“Of course, the ideal solution would be for you to Transfigure yourself into
a submarine or something,” Hermione said. “If only we’d done human
Transfiguration already! But I don’t think we start that until sixth year, and it
can go badly wrong if you don’t know what you’re doing. . . .”
“Yeah, I don’t fancy walking around with a periscope sticking out of my
head,” said Harry. “I s’pose I the hand holding the Triwizard Cup; it was

FLESH, BLOOD, AND BONE
arry felt his feet slam into the ground; his injured leg gave way, and he
fell forward; his hand let go of the Triwizard Cup at last. He raised his
head.
“Where are we?” he said.
Cedric shook his head. He got up, pulled Harry to his feet, and they looked
around.
They had left the Hogwarts grounds completely; they had obviously
traveled miles — perhaps hundreds of miles — for even the mountains
surrounding the castle were gone. They were standing instead in a dark and
overgrown graveyard; the black outline of a small church was visible beyond
a large yew tree to their right. A hill rose above them to their left. Harry could
just make out the outline of a fine old house on the hillside.
Cedric looked down at the Triwizard Cup and then up at Harry.
“Did anyone tell 
you
 the Cup was a Portkey?” he asked.
“Nope,” said Harry. He was looking around the"
Who killed Dumbledore?,Severus Snape,I do not know. The passage does not mention who killed Dumbledore.,"waited, but Dumbledore did not speak.
“I still don’t understand.”
“Voldemort tried to kill you when you were a child because of a prophecy
made shortly before your birth. He knew the prophecy had been made, though
he did not know its full contents. He set out to kill you when you were still a
baby, believing he was fulfilling the terms of the prophecy. He discovered, to
his cost, that he was mistaken, when the curse intended to kill you backfired.
And so, since his return to his body, and particularly since your extraordinary
escape from him last year, he has been determined to hear that prophecy in its
entirety. This is the weapon he has been seeking so assiduously since his
return: the knowledge of how to destroy you.”
The sun had risen fully now. Dumbledore’s office was bathed in it. The
glass case in which the sword of Godric Gryffindor resided gleamed white
and opaque, the fragments of the instruments Harry had thrown to the floor
glistened like raindrops, and behind him, the baby Fawkes made soft
chirru s were directed only at Voldemort, who
had tampered so ill-advisedly with the deepest laws of magic. Only toward
him was that wand abnormally powerful. Otherwise it was a wand like any
other . . . though a good one, I am sure,” Dumbledore finished kindly.Harry sat in thought for a long time, or perhaps seconds. It was very hard to
be sure of things like time, here.
“He killed me with your wand.”
“He 
failed 
to kill you with my wand,” Dumbledore corrected Harry. “I
think we can agree that you are not dead — though, of course,” he added, as if
fearing he had been discourteous, “I do not minimize your sufferings, which I
am sure were severe.”
“I feel great at the moment, though,” said Harry, looking down at his clean,
unblemished hands. “Where are we, exactly?”
“Well, I was going to ask you that,” said Dumbledore, looking around.
“Where would you say that we are?”
Until Dumbledore had asked, Harry had not known. Now, however, he
found that he had an answer ready to give.
“It looks,” he said slowly, “like King’s  was Dumbledore’s spy
from the moment you threatened her, and he’s been working against you ever
since! Dumbledore was already dying when Snape finished him!”
“It matters not!” shrieked Voldemort, who had followed every word with
rapt attention, but now let out a cackle of mad laughter. “It matters not
whether Snape was mine or Dumbledore’s, or what petty obstacles they tried
to put in my path! I crushed them as I crushed your mother, Snape’s supposed
great 
love
! Oh, but it all makes sense, Potter, and in ways that you do not
understand!
“Dumbledore was trying to keep the Elder Wand from me! He intended that
Snape should be the true master of the wand! But I got there ahead of you,
little boy — I reached the wand before you could get your hands on it, I
understood the truth before you caught up. I killed Severus Snape three hours
ago, and the Elder Wand, the Deathstick, the Wand of Destiny is truly mine!
Dumbledore’s last plan went wrong, Harry Potter!”
“Yeah, it did,” said Harry. “You’re right. But before  d over his shoulder to where the small, maimed creature
trembled under the chair.
“What is that, Professor?”
“Something that is beyond either of our help,” said Dumbledore.
“But if Voldemort used the Killing Curse,” Harry started again, “and
nobody died for me this time — how can I be alive?”
“I think you know,” said Dumbledore. “Think back. Remember what he
did, in his ignorance, in his greed and his cruelty.”
Harry thought. He let his gaze drift over his surroundings. If it was indeed a
palace in which they sat, it was an odd one, with chairs set in little rows and
bits of railing here and there, and still, he and Dumbledore and the stunted
creature under the chair were the only beings there. Then the answer rose to
his lips easily, without effort.
“He took my blood,” said Harry.
“Precisely!” said Dumbledore. “He took your blood and rebuilt his living
body with it! Your blood in his veins, Harry, Lily’s protection inside both of
you! He tethered you to life while he lives!”
“I live . . . while he lives? But ed his throat; it was dry from panic and the smoke.
“Hagrid, he killed . . .”
“Killed?” said Hagrid loudly, staring down at Harry. “Snape killed?
What’re yeh on abou’, Harry?”
“Dumbledore,” said Harry. “Snape killed . . . Dumbledore.”
Hagrid simply looked at him, the little of his face that could be seen
completely blank, uncomprehending.
“Dumbledore wha’, Harry?”
“He’s dead. Snape killed him. . . .”
“Don’ say that,” said Hagrid roughly. “Snape kill Dumbledore — don’ be
stupid, Harry. Wha’s made yeh say tha’?”
“I saw it happen.”
“Yeh couldn’ have.”
“I saw it, Hagrid.”
Hagrid shook his head; his expression was disbelieving but sympathetic,
and Harry knew that Hagrid thought he had sustained a blow to the head, that
he was confused, perhaps by the aftereffects of a jinx. . . .
“What musta happened was, Dumbledore musta told Snape ter go with
them Death Eaters,” Hagrid said confidently. “I suppose he’s gotta keep his
cover. Look, let’s get yeh back up ter the school. Come on, Harry. . . .”
Harry did not attempt  ing her to the floor. Meanwhile, the goblin
and the house-elf scuttled toward the fireplaces set along the wall, and the
one-armed centaur galloped at Voldemort, who vanished and reappeared
beside the pool. The headless statue thrust Harry backward, away from the
fight, as Dumbledore advanced on Voldemort and the golden centaur cantered
around them both.
“It was foolish to come here tonight, Tom,” said Dumbledore calmly. “The
Aurors are on their way —”
“By which time I shall be gone, and you dead!” spat Voldemort. He sent
another Killing Curse at Dumbledore but missed, instead hitting the security
guard’s desk, which burst into flame.
Dumbledore flicked his own wand. The force of the spell that emanated
from it was such that Harry, though shielded by his stone guard, felt his hair
stand on end as it passed, and this time Voldemort was forced to conjure a
shining silver shield out of thin air to deflect it. The spell, whatever it was,
caused no visible damage to the shield, though a deep, gonglike note
reverbe hter, he hoped to discredit Arthur and get rid of a highly incriminating
magical object in one stroke. Ah, poor Lucius . . . what with Voldemort’s fury
about the fact that he threw away the Horcrux for his own gain, and the fiasco
at the Ministry last year, I would not be surprised if he is not secretly glad to
be safe in Azkaban at the moment.”Harry sat in thought for a moment, then asked, “So if all of his Horcruxes
are destroyed, Voldemort 
could
 be killed?”
“Yes, I think so,” said Dumbledore. “Without his Horcruxes, Voldemort
will be a mortal man with a maimed and diminished soul. Never forget,
though, that while his soul may be damaged beyond repair, his brain and his
magical powers remain intact. It will take uncommon skill and power to kill a
wizard like Voldemort even without his Horcruxes.”
“But I haven’t got uncommon skill and power,” said Harry, before he could
stop himself.
“Yes, you have,” said Dumbledore firmly. “You have a power that
Voldemort has never had. You can —”
“I know!” said Harry imp erever they had murdered. . . .
“When did it appear?” asked Dumbledore, and his hand clenched painfully
upon Harry’s shoulder as he struggled to his feet.
“Must have been minutes ago, it wasn’t there when I put the cat out, but
when I got upstairs —”
“We need to return to the castle at once,” said Dumbledore. “Rosmerta” —
and though he staggered a little, he seemed wholly in command of the
situation — “we need transport — brooms —”
“I’ve got a couple behind the bar,” she said, looking very frightened. “Shall
I run and fetch — ?”
“No, Harry can do it.”
Harry raised his wand at once.
“Accio Rosmerta’s Brooms!”
A second later they heard a loud bang as the front door of the pub burst
open; two brooms had shot out into the street and were racing each other to
Harry’s side, where they stopped dead, quivering slightly at waist height.
“Rosmerta, please send a message to the Ministry,” said Dumbledore, as he
mounted the broom nearest him. “It might be that nobody within Hogwarts
has yet realized anything is wrong. . "
What shape is Harry's scar?,A lightning bolt,The shape of Harry's scar is lightning-shaped.,"arding world.
Harry looked nothing like the rest of the family. Uncle Vernon was large
and neckless, with an enormous black mustache; Aunt Petunia was horse-
faced and bony; Dudley was blond, pink, and porky. Harry, on the other hand,
was small and skinny, with brilliant green eyes and jet-black hair that was
always untidy. He wore round glasses, and on his forehead was a thin,
lightning-shaped scar.
It was this scar that made Harry so particularly unusual, even for a wizard.
This scar was the only hint of Harry’s very mysterious past, of the reason he
had been left on the Dursleys’ doorstep eleven years before.
At the age of one year old, Harry had somehow survived a curse from the
greatest Dark sorcerer of all time, Lord Voldemort, whose name most witches
and wizards still feared to speak. Harry’s parents had died in Voldemort’sattack, but Harry had escaped with his lightning scar, and somehow —
nobody understood why — Voldemort’s powers had been destroyed the
instant he had failed to kill Harry.
So Harry h e lightning scar on Harry’s forehead with a long,
white finger.
“I’m sorry to say I sold the wand that did it,” he said softly. “Thirteen-and-
a-half inches. Yew. Powerful wand, very powerful, and in the wrong
hands . . . well, if I’d known what that wand was going out into the world to
do. . . .”
He shook his head and then, to Harry’s relief, spotted Hagrid.
“Rubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you again. . . . Oak, sixteen
inches, rather bendy, wasn’t it?”
“It was, sir, yes,” said Hagrid.“Good wand, that one. But I suppose they snapped it in half when you got
expelled?” said Mr. Ollivander, suddenly stern.
“Er — yes, they did, yes,” said Hagrid, shuffling his feet. “I’ve still got the
pieces, though,” he added brightly.
“But you don’t use them?” said Mr. Ollivander sharply.
“Oh, no, sir,” said Hagrid quickly. Harry noticed he gripped his pink
umbrella very tightly as he spoke.
“Hmmm,” said Mr. Ollivander, giving Hagrid a piercing look. “Well, now
— Mr. Potter. Let me see.” He pulled a long tape measure w e only living creature in this house
who didn’t flinch at the sight of him.
Harry, though still rather small and skinny for his age, had grown a few
inches over the last year. His jet-black hair, however, was just as it always had
been — stubbornly untidy, whatever he did to it. The eyes behind his glasses
were bright green, and on his forehead, clearly visible through his hair, was a
thin scar, shaped like a bolt of lightning.
Of all the unusual things about Harry, this scar was the most extraordinary
of all. It was not, as the Dursleys had pretended for ten years, a souvenir of
the car crash that had killed Harry’s parents, because Lily and James Potter
had not died in a car crash. They had been murdered, murdered by the most
feared Dark wizard for a hundred years, Lord Voldemort. Harry had escaped
from the same attack with nothing more than a scar on his forehead, where
Voldemort’s curse, instead of killing him, had rebounded upon its originator.
Barely alive, Voldemort had fled. . . .
But Harry had come f ded
figure raised its head and looked right at Harry — unicorn blood was
dribbling down its front. It got to its feet and came swiftly toward Harry — he
couldn’t move for fear.
Then a pain like he’d never felt before pierced his head; it was as though
his scar were on fire. Half blinded, he staggered backward. He heard hooves
behind him, galloping, and something jumped clean over Harry, charging at
the figure.
The pain in Harry’s head was so bad he fell to his knees. It took a minute or
two to pass. When he looked up, the figure had gone. A centaur was standing
over him, not Ronan or Bane; this one looked younger; he had white-blond
hair and a palomino body.
“Are you all right?” said the centaur, pulling Harry to his feet.
“Yes — thank you — what 
was
 that?”
The centaur didn’t answer. He had astonishingly blue eyes, like pale
sapphires. He looked carefully at Harry, his eyes lingering on the scar that
stood out, livid, on Harry’s forehead.
“You are the Potter boy,” he said. “You had better get back to Hagrid  it. “If you’re telling the
truth, ugly, you’ve got nothing to fear from a trip to the Ministry. I expect
your father’ll reward us just for picking you up.”
“But,” said Harry, his mouth bone dry, “if you just let us —”
“Hey!” came a shout from inside the tent. “Look at this, Greyback!”
A dark figure came bustling toward them, and Harry saw a glint of silver in
the light of their wands. They had found Gryffindor’s sword.
“Ve-e-ry nice,” said Greyback appreciatively, taking it from his companion.
“Oh, very nice indeed. Looks goblin-made, that. Where did you get
something like this?”
“It’s my father’s,” Harry lied, hoping against hope that it was too dark for
Greyback to see the name etched just below the hilt. “We borrowed it to cut
firewood —”“’ang on a minute, Greyback! Look at this, in the 
Prophet
!”
As Scabior said it, Harry’s scar, which was stretched tight across his
distended forehead, burned savagely. More clearly than he could make out
anything around him, he saw a towering building, a grim fortress,   could see her hair from all directions. “It means I
can change my appearance at will,” she added, spotting Harry’s puzzled
expression in the mirror behind her. “I was born one. I got top marks in
Concealment and Disguise during Auror training without any study at all, it
was great.”
“You’re an Auror?” said Harry, impressed. Being a Dark wizard catcher
was the only career he’d ever considered after Hogwarts.
“Yeah,” said Tonks, looking proud. “Kingsley is as well; he’s a bit higher
up than I am, though. I only qualified a year ago. Nearly failed on Stealth and
Tracking, I’m dead clumsy, did you hear me break that plate when we arrived
downstairs?”
“Can you learn how to be a Metamorphmagus?” Harry asked her,
straightening up, completely forgetting about packing.
Tonks chuckled.
“Bet you wouldn’t mind hiding that scar sometimes, eh?”
Her eyes found the lightning-shaped scar on Harry’s forehead.
“No, I wouldn’t mind,” Harry mumbled, turning away. He did not like
people staring at his scar.
“Well, you’ll have to   its
ugly triangular head and hissed slightly as the legs of the chair snagged on its
rug.
And then the chair was facing Frank, and he saw what was sitting in it. His
walking stick fell to the floor with a clatter. He opened his mouth and let out a
scream. He was screaming so loudly that he never heard the words the thing
in the chair spoke as it raised a wand. There was a flash of green light, a
rushing sound, and Frank Bryce crumpled. He was dead before he hit the
floor.
Two hundred miles away, the boy called Harry Potter woke with a start.H
 
CHAPTER  TWO
THE SCAR
arry lay flat on his back, breathing hard as though he had been running.
He had awoken from a vivid dream with his hands pressed over his
face. The old scar on his forehead, which was shaped like a bolt of lightning,
was burning beneath his fingers as though someone had just pressed a white-
hot wire to his skin.
He sat up, one hand still on his scar, the other reaching out in the darkness
for his glasses, which were on the bedside table. He put  nt. He placed
Flying with the Cannons
 on his bedside table, crossed to the window, and
drew back the curtains to survey the street below.Privet Drive looked exactly as a respectable suburban street would be
expected to look in the early hours of Saturday morning. All the curtains were
closed. As far as Harry could see through the darkness, there wasn’t a living
creature in sight, not even a cat.
And yet . . . and yet . . . Harry went restlessly back to the bed and sat down
on it, running a finger over his scar again. It wasn’t the pain that bothered
him; Harry was no stranger to pain and injury. He had lost all the bones from
his right arm once and had them painfully regrown in a night. The same arm
had been pierced by a venomous foot-long fang not long afterward. Only last
year Harry had fallen fifty feet from an airborne broomstick. He was used to
bizarre accidents and injuries; they were unavoidable if you attended
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and had a knack for attracting a
lot of trouble."
Who are Harry's parents?,James and Lily Potter,"According to the texts, Harry's parents are James Potter and Lily Evans Potter, who were a witch and wizard.","and ends up
setting fire to his bed.”
“I think he’s brilliant,” said Harry coldly.
“
Do
 you?” said the boy, with a slight sneer. “Why is he with you? Where
are your parents?”
“They’re dead,” said Harry shortly. He didn’t feel much like going into the
matter with this boy.
“Oh, sorry,” said the other, not sounding sorry at all. “But they were 
ourkind, weren’t they?”
“They were a witch and wizard, if that’s what you mean.”
“I really don’t think they should let the other sort in, do you? They’re just
not the same, they’ve never been brought up to know our ways. Some of them
have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine. I think
they should keep it in the old wizarding families. What’s your surname,
anyway?”
But before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, “That’s you done, my
dear,” and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped
down from the footstool.
“Well, I’ll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,” said the drawling boy.
Harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cre n his investigations
into his previously despised mother’s family — the woman whom, you will
remember, he had thought could not be a witch if she had succumbed to the
shameful human weakness of death.
“All he had to go upon was the single name ‘Marvolo,’ which he knew
from those who ran the orphanage had been his mother’s father’s name.
Finally, after painstaking research through old books of Wizarding families,
he discovered the existence of Slytherin’s surviving line. In the summer of his
sixteenth year, he left the orphanage to which he returned annually and set off
to find his Gaunt relatives. And now, Harry, if you will stand . . .”
Dumbledore rose, and Harry saw that he was again holding a small crystal
bottle filled with swirling, pearly memory.
“I was very lucky to collect this,” he said, as he poured the gleaming mass
into the Pensieve. “As you will understand when we have experienced it.
Shall we?”
Harry stepped up to the stone basin and bowed obediently until his face
sank through the surface of th ?” asked Harry, who found Ron just as
interesting as Ron found him.
“Er — yes, I think so,” said Ron. “I think Mum’s got a second cousin
who’s an accountant, but we never talk about him.”
“So you must know loads of magic already.”The Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale boy
in Diagon Alley had talked about.
“I heard you went to live with Muggles,” said Ron. “What are they like?”
“Horrible — well, not all of them. My aunt and uncle and cousin are,
though. Wish I’d had three wizard brothers.”
“Five,” said Ron. For some reason, he was looking gloomy. “I’m the sixth
in our family to go to Hogwarts. You could say I’ve got a lot to live up to. Bill
and Charlie have already left — Bill was head boy and Charlie was captain of
Quidditch. Now Percy’s a prefect. Fred and George mess around a lot, but
they still get really good marks and everyone thinks they’re really funny.
Everyone expects me to do as well as the others, but if I do, it’s no big deal,
because they did it first. You never g  about that
now?”
“No — no — Harry, I didn’t mean that!” she said hastily, looking around to
check that they were not being overheard. “It’s just that I was right about
Eileen Prince once owning the book. You see . . . she was Snape’s mother!”
“I thought she wasn’t much of a looker,” said Ron. Hermione ignored him.
“I was going through the rest of the old 
Prophets
 and there was a tiny
announcement about Eileen Prince marrying a man called Tobias Snape, and
then later an announcement saying that she’d given birth to a —”
“— murderer,” spat Harry.
“Well . . . yes,” said Hermione. “So . . . I was sort of right. Snape must have
been proud of being ‘half a Prince,’ you see? Tobias Snape was a Muggle
from what it said in the 
Prophet.
”
“Yeah, that fits,” said Harry. “He’d play up the pure-blood side so he could
get in with Lucius Malfoy and the rest of them. . . . He’s just like Voldemort.
Pure-blood mother, Muggle father . . . ashamed of his parentage, trying to
make himself feared using the Dark Arts, gave him  STATUS:

Hogwarts. NB: Youngest son currently at home,seriously ill, Ministry inspectors have confirmed.
SECURITY STATUS:

Strong likelihood Undesirable No. 1 will contact (has
stayed with Weasley family previously)
“Undesirable Number One,” Harry muttered under his breath as he
replaced Mr. Weasley’s folder and shut the drawer. He had an idea he knew
who that was, and sure enough, as he straightened up and glanced around the
office for fresh hiding places, he saw a poster of himself on the wall, with the
words 
UNDESIRABLE NO. 1
 emblazoned across his chest. A little pink note was
stuck to it with a picture of a kitten in the corner. Harry moved across to read
it and saw that Umbridge had written, 
“To be punished.”
Angrier than ever, he proceeded to grope in the bottoms of the vases and
baskets of dried flowers, b ere his mother had rubbed it.
“Hey, Mum, guess what? Guess who we just met on the train?”
Harry leaned back quickly so they couldn’t see him looking.
“You know that black-haired boy who was near us in the station? Know
who he is?”
“Who?”
“Harry Potter!”
Harry heard the little girl’s voice.
“Oh, Mum, can I go on the train and see him, Mum, oh please. . . .”
“You’ve already seen him, Ginny, and the poor boy isn’t something you
goggle at in a zoo. Is he really, Fred? How do you know?”
“Asked him. Saw his scar. It’s really there — like lightning.”
“Poor 
dear
 — no wonder he was alone, I wondered. He was ever so politewhen he asked how to get onto the platform.”
“Never mind that, do you think he remembers what You-Know-Who looks
like?”
Their mother suddenly became very stern.
“I forbid you to ask him, Fred. No, don’t you dare. As though he needs
reminding of that on his first day at school.”
“All right, keep your hair on.”
A whistle sounded.
“Hurry up!” their mother said, and the three boys clambered onto the tra  by a curly-haired
Hufflepuff boy Harry knew by sight but had never spoken to.
“Justin Finch-Fletchley,” he said brightly, shaking Harry by the hand.
“Know who you are, of course, the famous Harry Potter. . . . And you’re
Hermione Granger — always top in everything” (Hermione beamed as she
had her hand shaken too) “— and Ron Weasley. Wasn’t that your flying car?”
Ron didn’t smile. The Howler was obviously still on his mind.
“That Lockhart’s something, isn’t he?” said Justin happily as they began
filling their plant pots with dragon dung compost. “Awfully brave chap. Have
you read his books? I’d have died of fear if I’d been cornered in a telephone
booth by a werewolf, but he stayed cool and — zap — just 
fantastic.
“My name was down for Eton, you know. I can’t tell you how glad I am Icame here instead. Of course, Mother was slightly disappointed, but since I
made her read Lockhart’s books I think she’s begun to see how useful it’ll be
to have a fully trained wizard in the family. . . .”
After that they didn’t sn’t,” said Hermione sharply, looking up. “Look what
happened to Hagrid when Rita found out about his mother. Look at Fudge,
jumping to conclusions about her, just because she’s part giant. Who needs
that sort of prejudice? I’d probably say I had big bones if I knew that’s what
I’d get for telling the truth.”
Hermione looked at her watch. “We haven’t done any practicing!” she said,
looking shocked. “We were going to do the Impediment Curse! We’ll have to
really get down to it tomorrow! Come on, Harry, you need to get some sleep.”
Harry and Ron went slowly upstairs to their dormitory. As Harry pulled on
his pajamas, he looked over at Neville’s bed. True to his word to Dumbledore,
he had not told Ron and Hermione about Neville’s parents. As Harry took offhis glasses and climbed into his four-poster, he imagined how it must feel to
have parents still living but unable to recognize you. He often got sympathy
from strangers for being an orphan, but as he listened to Neville’s snores, he
thought that Neville deserv"
What spell is used to unlock doors?,Alohomora,"The spell used to unlock doors is ""Alohomora"".","CHARMS CORRIDOR!”Ducking under Peeves, they ran for their lives, right to the end of the
corridor where they slammed into a door — and it was locked.
“This is it!” Ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at the door, “We’re
done for! This is the end!”
They could hear footsteps, Filch running as fast as he could toward
Peeves’s shouts.
“Oh, move over,” Hermione snarled. She grabbed Harry’s wand, tapped the
lock, and whispered, 
“Alohomora!”
The lock clicked and the door swung open — they piled through it, shut it
quickly, and pressed their ears against it, listening.
“Which way did they go, Peeves?” Filch was saying. “Quick, tell me.”
“Say ‘please.’”
“Don’t mess with me, Peeves, now 
where did they go
?”
“Shan’t say nothing if you don’t say please,” said Peeves in his annoying
singsong voice.
“All right — 
please.
”
“NOTHING! Ha haaa! Told you I wouldn’t say nothing if you didn’t say
please! Ha ha! Haaaaaa!” And they heard the sound of Peeves whooshing
away and Filch cursing in rage.
“He thinks this door is lock  to pass without drawing attention to themselves. He expected to
encounter an obstacle at any moment; his worst fear was Peeves, and he
strained his ears with every step to hear the first, telltale signs of the
poltergeist’s approach.
“This way, Harry,” breathed Luna, plucking his sleeve and pulling him
toward a spiral staircase.
They climbed in tight, dizzying circles; Harry had never been up here
before. At last they reached a door. There was no handle and no keyhole:
nothing but a plain expanse of aged wood, and a bronze knocker in the shape
of an eagle.
Luna reached out a pale hand, which looked eerie floating in midair,
unconnected to arm or body. She knocked once, and in the silence it sounded
to Harry like a cannon blast. At once the beak of the eagle opened, but instead
of a bird’s call, a soft, musical voice said, “Which came first, the phoenix or
the flame?”
“Hmm . . . What do you think, Harry?” said Luna, looking thoughtful.
“What? Isn’t there just a password?”
“Oh no, you’ve got to answer a questi emained unlocked.”
“I’d rather not be interrupted,” said Scrimgeour shortly, “or watched,” he
added, pointing his wand at the windows, so that the curtains swept across
them. “Right, well, I’m a busy man, so let’s get down to business. First of all,
we need to discuss your security.”
The Prime Minister drew himself up to his fullest height and replied, “I am
perfectly happy with the security I’ve already got, thank you very —”
“Well, we’re not,” Scrimgeour cut in. “It’ll be a poor lookout for the
Muggles if their Prime Minister gets put under the Imperius Curse. The new
secretary in your outer office —”
“I’m not getting rid of Kingsley Shacklebolt, if that’s what you’re
suggesting!” said the Prime Minister hotly. “He’s highly efficient, gets
through twice the work the rest of them —”
“That’s because he’s a wizard,” said Scrimgeour, without a flicker of a
smile. “A highly trained Auror, who has been assigned to you for your
protection.”
“Now, wait a moment!” declared the Prime Minister. “You can’t just put
you PPARATE INSIDE THIS CASTLE!
THIS — HAS — SOMETHING — TO — DO — WITH — POTTER!”
“Severus — be reasonable — Harry has been locked up —”
BAM.
The door of the hospital wing burst open.
Fudge, Snape, and Dumbledore came striding into the ward. Dumbledore
alone looked calm. Indeed, he looked as though he was quite enjoyinghimself. Fudge appeared angry. But Snape was beside himself.
“OUT WITH IT, POTTER!” he bellowed. “WHAT DID YOU DO?”
“Professor Snape!” shrieked Madam Pomfrey. “Control yourself!”
“See here, Snape, be reasonable,” said Fudge. “This door’s been locked, we
just saw —”
“THEY HELPED HIM ESCAPE, I KNOW IT!” Snape howled, pointing at
Harry and Hermione. His face was twisted; spit was flying from his mouth.
“Calm down, man!” Fudge barked. “You’re talking nonsense!”
“YOU DON’T KNOW POTTER!” shrieked Snape. “HE DID IT, I KNOW
HE DID IT —”
“That will do, Severus,” said Dumbledore quietly. “Think about what you
are saying. This door has been locked since I left the ward ten minutes ago.
Madam Pomfrey, have th o you!”
There was no sound from within.
“If you don’t open the door, we’ll blast it open!” Harry said, pulling out his
wand.
“Harry!” said Hermione, sounding shocked. “You can’t possibly —”
“Yeah, I can!” said Harry. “Stand back —”
But before he could say anything else, the door flew open again as Harry
had known it would, and there stood Hagrid, glowering down at him and
looking, despite the flowery apron, positively alarming.
“I’m a teacher!” he roared at Harry. “A teacher, Potter! How dare yeh
threaten ter break down my door!”
“I’m sorry, 
sir,
” said Harry, emphasizing the last word as he stowed his
wand inside his robes.
Hagrid looked stunned. “Since when have yeh called me ‘sir’?”
“Since when have you called me ‘Potter’?”
“Oh, very clever,” growled Hagrid. “Very amusin’. That’s me outsmarted,
innit? All righ’, come in then, yeh ungrateful little . . .”
Mumbling darkly, he stood back to let them pass. Hermione scurried inafter Harry, looking rather frightened.
“Well?” said Hagrid grumpily, as Harry, Ron, be a
very good way to attack you and make it look like an accident.”
“Looks like a really good plan from where I’m standing,” said Harry,
grinning bleakly. “They’ll just have to stand back and let the dragons do their
stuff.”
“Right — these dragons,” said Sirius, speaking very quickly now. “There’s
a way, Harry. Don’t be tempted to try a Stunning Spell — dragons are strong
and too powerfully magical to be knocked out by a single Stunner, you need
about half a dozen wizards at a time to overcome a dragon —”
“Yeah, I know, I just saw,” said Harry.
“But you can do it alone,” said Sirius. “There is a way, and a simple spell’s
all you need. Just —”
But Harry held up a hand to silence him, his heart suddenly pounding as
though it would burst. He could hear footsteps coming down the spiral
staircase behind him.
“Go!” he hissed at Sirius. “
Go!
 There’s someone coming!”Harry scrambled to his feet, hiding the fire — if someone saw Sirius’s face
within the walls of Hogwarts, they would raise an almighty uproar — the
Mi ntinued to hoot feebly as it smoked. Harry hurried off up
the corridor as the young witch said, “I bet it sneaked up here from
Experimental Charms, they’re so careless, remember that poisonous duck?”
Speeding back toward the lifts, Harry reviewed his options. It had never
been likely that the locket was here at the Ministry, and there was no hope of
bewitching its whereabouts out of Umbridge while she was sitting in a
crowded court. Their priority now had to be to leave the Ministry before they
were exposed, and try again another day. The first thing to do was to find
Ron, and then they could work out a way of extracting Hermione from the
courtroom.
The lift was empty when it arrived. Harry jumped in and pulled off the
Invisibility Cloak as it started its descent. To his enormous relief, when it
rattled to a halt at level two, a soaking-wet and wild-eyed Ron got in.
“M-morning,” he stammered to Harry as the lift set off again.
“Ron, it’s me, Harry!”
“Harry! Blimey, I forgot what you looked like — why isn’t He t and a sallow-skinned wizard with a very mournful face
got in.
“Morning, Arthur,” he said in a sepulchral voice as the lift began to
descend. “Don’t often see you down here . . .”
“Urgent business, Bode,” said Mr. Weasley, who was bouncing on the balls
of his feet and throwing anxious looks over at Harry.
“Ah, yes,” said Bode, surveying Harry unblinkingly. “Of course.”
Harry barely had emotion to spare for Bode, but his unfaltering gaze did
not make him feel any more comfortable.
“Department of Mysteries,” said the cool female voice, and left it at that.
“Quick, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley as the lift doors rattled open, and they
sped up a corridor that was quite different from those above. The walls were
bare; there were no windows and no doors apart from a plain black one set at
the very end of the corridor. Harry expected them to go through it, but instead
Mr. Weasley seized him by the arm and dragged him to the left, where there
was an opening leading to a flight of steps.
“Down here, down here,” panted Mr."
What does the Imperius Curse do?,Controls the victim,"According to the text, the Imperius Curse is a spell that can control the actions of the victim, making them do things against their will.","ne of your throats . . .”
Ron gave an involuntary shudder.
“Years back, there were a lot of witches and wizards being controlled by
the Imperius Curse,” said Moody, and Harry knew he was talking about the
days in which Voldemort had been all-powerful. “Some job for the Ministry,
trying to sort out who was being forced to act, and who was acting of their
own free will.
“The Imperius Curse can be fought, and I’ll be teaching you how, but it
takes real strength of character, and not everyone’s got it. Better avoid beinghit with it if you can. CONSTANT VIGILANCE!” he barked, and everyone
jumped.
Moody picked up the somersaulting spider and threw it back into the jar.
“Anyone else know one? Another illegal curse?”
Hermione’s hand flew into the air again and so, to Harry’s slight surprise,
did Neville’s. The only class in which Neville usually volunteered
information was Herbology, which was easily his best subject. Neville looked
surprised at his own daring.
“Yes?” said Moody, his magical eye rolling right over to out to
fall asleep. “. . . of course . . . Rosmerta. How long has she been under the
Imperius Curse?”
“Got there at last, have you?” Malfoy taunted.
There was another yell from below, rather louder than the last. Malfoy
looked nervously over his shoulder again, then back at Dumbledore, who
went on: “So poor Rosmerta was forced to lurk in her own bathroom and pass
that necklace to any Hogwarts student who entered the room unaccompanied?
And the poisoned mead . . . well, naturally, Rosmerta was able to poison it for
you before she sent the bottle to Slughorn, believing that it was to be my
Christmas present. . . . Yes, very neat . . . very neat . . . Poor Mr. Filch would
not, of course, think to check a bottle of Rosmerta’s. Tell me, how have you
been communicating with Rosmerta? I thought we had all methods of
communication in and out of the school monitored.”
“Enchanted coins,” said Malfoy, as though he was compelled to keep
talking, though his wand hand was shaking badly. “I had one and she had the
other and curse on you isn’t going to tell you what he’s about to do. He’s not
going to do it nice and polite to your face. You need to be prepared. You need
to be alert and watchful. You need to put that away, Miss Brown, when I’m
talking.”
Lavender jumped and blushed. She had been showing Parvati her
completed horoscope under the desk. Apparently Moody’s magical eye could
see through solid wood, as well as out of the back of his head.
“So . . . do any of you know which curses are most heavily punished by
Wizarding law?”
Several hands rose tentatively into the air, including Ron’s and Hermione’s.
Moody pointed at Ron, though his magical eye was still fixed on Lavender.
“Er,” said Ron tentatively, “my dad told me about one. . . . Is it called theImperius Curse, or something?”
“Ah, yes,” said Moody appreciatively. “Your father 
would
 know that one.
Gave the Ministry a lot of trouble at one time, the Imperius Curse.”
Moody got heavily to his mismatched feet, opened his desk drawer, and
took out a glass jar. Three large   much as a nosebleed. But that doesn’t matter.
I’m not here to teach you how to do it.
“Now, if there’s no countercurse, why am I showing you? 
Because you’ve
got to know.
 You’ve got to appreciate what the worst is. You don’t want to
find yourself in a situation where you’re facing it. CONSTANT
VIGILANCE!” he roared, and the whole class jumped again.
“Now . . . those three curses — 
Avada Kedavra,
 Imperius, and Cruciatus —
are known as the Unforgivable Curses. The use of any one of them on a
fellow human being is enough to earn a life sentence in Azkaban. That’s what
you’re up against. That’s what I’ve got to teach you to fight. You need
preparing. You need arming. But most of all, you need to practice 
constant,
never-ceasing vigilance.
 Get out your quills . . . copy this down. . . .”
They spent the rest of the lesson taking notes on each of the Unforgivable
Curses. No one spoke until the bell rang — but when Moody had dismissed
them and they had left the classroom, a torrent of talk burst forth. Most peo r . . . of
returning to his service.”
“How did your father subdue you?” said Dumbledore.
“The Imperius Curse,” Crouch said. “I was under my father’s control. I was
forced to wear an Invisibility Cloak day and night. I was always with the
house-elf. She was my keeper and caretaker. She pitied me. She persuaded my
father to give me occasional treats. Rewards for my good behavior.”
“Master Barty, Master Barty,” sobbed Winky through her hands. “You isn’t
ought to tell them, we is getting in trouble. . . .”
“Did anybody ever discover that you were still alive?” said Dumbledore
softly. “Did anyone know except your father and the house-elf?”
“Yes,” said Crouch, his eyelids flickering again. “A witch in my father’s
office. Bertha Jorkins. She came to the house with papers for my father’s
signature. He was not at home. Winky showed her inside and returned to the
kitchen, to me. But Bertha Jorkins heard Winky talking to me. She came to
investigate. She heard enough to guess who was hiding under the Invisibility
Cloak.   fix on Neville.
“There’s one — the Cruciatus Curse,” said Neville in a small but distinct
voice.
Moody was looking very intently at Neville, this time with both eyes.
“Your name’s Longbottom?” he said, his magical eye swooping down to
check the register again.
Neville nodded nervously, but Moody made no further inquiries. Turning
back to the class at large, he reached into the jar for the next spider and placed
it upon the desktop, where it remained motionless, apparently too scared to
move.
“The Cruciatus Curse,” said Moody. “Needs to be a bit bigger for you to
get the idea,” he said, pointing his wand at the spider. 
“Engorgio!”
The spider swelled. It was now larger than a tarantula. Abandoning all
pretense, Ron pushed his chair backward, as far away from Moody’s desk as
possible.
Moody raised his wand again, pointed it at the spider, and muttered,
“Crucio!”

Potion. The other ingredients were easy. I stole boomslang skin from the
dungeons. When the Potions master found me in his office, I said I was under
orders to search it.”“And what became of Wormtail after you attacked Moody?” said
Dumbledore.
“Wormtail returned to care for my master, in my father’s house, and to keep
watch over my father.”
“But your father escaped,” said Dumbledore.
“Yes. After a while he began to fight the Imperius Curse just as I had done.
There were periods when he knew what was happening. My master decided it
was no longer safe for my father to leave the house. He forced him to send
letters to the Ministry instead. He made him write and say he was ill. But
Wormtail neglected his duty. He was not watchful enough. My father escaped.

 and a red bolt of light shot from his
own wand, cleaving a gap between the four pursuing Death Eaters as they
scattered to avoid it.
“Hold on, Harry, this’ll do for ’em!” roared Hagrid, and Harry looked up
just in time to see Hagrid slamming a thick finger into a green button near the
fuel gauge.
A wall, a solid brick wall, erupted out of the exhaust pipe. Craning his
neck, Harry saw it expand into being in midair. Three of the Death Eatersswerved and avoided it, but the fourth was not so lucky: He vanished from
view and then dropped like a boulder from behind it, his broomstick broken
into pieces. One of his fellows slowed up to save him, but they and the
airborne wall were swallowed by darkness as Hagrid leaned low over the
handlebars and sped up.
More Killing Curses flew past Harry’s head from the two remaining Death
Eaters’ wands; they were aiming for Hagrid. Harry responded wit"

found out what they were used for.Easily the most boring class was History of Magic, which was the only one
taught by a ghost. Professor Binns had been very old indeed when he had
fallen asleep in front of the staffroom fire and got up next morning to teach,
leaving his body behind him. Binns droned on and on while they scribbled
down names and dates, and got Emeric the Evil and Uric the Oddball mixed
up.
Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny little wizard who had to
stand on a pile of books to see over his desk. At the start of their first class he
took the roll call, and when he reached Harry’s name he gave an excited
squeak and toppled out of sight.
Professor McGonagall was again different. Harry had been quite right to
think she wasn’t a teacher to cross. Strict and clever, she gave them a talking-

“Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you

Harry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at the High
Table again. Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet. Professor
McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore. Professor Quirrell, in his
absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose,
and sallow skin.
It happened very suddenly. The hook-nosed teacher looked past Quirrell’s
turban straight into Harry’s eyes — and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar
on Harry’s forehead.
“Ouch!” Harry clapped a hand to his head.
“What is it?” asked Percy.
“N-nothing.”
The pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder to shake off was the
feeling Harry had gotten from the teacher’s look — a feeling that he didn’t
like Harry at all.
“Who’s that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?” he asked Percy.

Flitwick and Professor McGonagall both spent the first fifteen minutes of
their lessons lecturing the class on the importance of O.W.L.s.
“What you must remember,” said little Professor Flitwick squeakily,
perched as ever on a pile of books so that he could see over the top of his
desk, “is that these examinations may influence your futures for many years

the time to do so. And in the meantime, I’m afraid, we shall be working
harder than ever to ensure that you all do yourselves justice!”
They then spent more than an hour reviewing Summoning Charms, which
according to Professor Flitwick were bound to come up in their O.W.L., and
he rounded off the lesson by setting them their largest amount of Charmshomework ever.

DUMBLEDORE’S GIANT MISTAKE
Albus Dumbledore, eccentric headmaster of Hogwarts School of
Witchcraft and Wizardry, has never been afraid to make
controversial staff appointments, 
writes Rita Skeeter, Special
Correspondent.
 In September of this year, he hired Alastor “Mad-
Eye” Moody, the notoriously jinx-happy ex-Auror, to teach Defense
Against the Dark Arts, a decision that caused many raised eyebrows
at the Ministry of Magic, given Moody’s well-known habit of
attacking anybody who makes a sudden movement in his presence.
Mad-Eye Moody, however, looks responsible and kindly when set
beside the part-human Dumbledore employs to teach Care ofMagical Creatures.
Rubeus Hagrid, who admits to being expelled from Hogwarts in
his third year, has enjoyed the position of gamekeeper at the school
ever since, a job secured for him by Dumbledore. Last year,
ho no reason why everybody in this
class should not achieve an O.W.L. in Transfiguration as long as they put in
the work.” Neville made a sad little disbelieving noise. “Yes, you too,
Longbottom,” said Professor McGonagall. “There’s nothing wrong with your
work except lack of confidence. So . . . today we are starting Vanishing
Spells. These are easier than Conjuring Spells, which you would not usually
attempt until N.E.W.T. level, but they are still among the most difficult magic
you will be tested on in your O.W.L.”
She was quite right; Harry found the Vanishing Spells horribly difficult. By
the end of a double period, neither he nor Ron had managed to vanish the
snails on which they were practicing, though Ron said hopefully that he
thought his looked a bit paler. Hermione, on the other hand, successfully
vanished her snail on the third attempt, earning her a ten-point bonus for
Gryffindor from Professor McGonagall. She was the only person not given
homework; everybody else was told to practice the spell over o effect
improvements at the Wizarding school. As recently as August 30th
Educational Decree Twenty-two was passed, to ensure that, in the event of the
current headmaster being unable to provide a candidate for a teaching post,
the Ministry should select an appropriate person.
“‘That’s how Dolores Umbridge came to be appointed to the teaching staff
at Hogwarts,’ said Weasley last night. ‘Dumbledore couldn’t find anyone, so
the Minister put in Umbridge and of course, she’s been an immediate success
—’”
“She’s been a WHAT?” said Harry loudly.
“Wait, there’s more,” said Hermione grimly.
“‘— an immediate success, totally revolutionizing the teaching of Defense
Against the Dark Arts and providing the Minister with on-the-ground
feedback about what’s really happening at Hogwarts.’
“It is this last function that the Ministry has now formalized with the
passing of Educational Decree Twenty-three, which creates the new position
of ‘Hogwarts High Inquisitor.’
“‘This is an exciting new phase in the Minister’s plan to ge werewolf Remus Lupin, half-giant Rubeus Hagrid, and delusional
ex-Auror ‘Mad-Eye’ Moody.
“Rumors abound, of course, that Albus Dumbledore, once Supreme
Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards and Chief Warlock
of the Wizengamot, is no longer up to the task of managing the prestigious
school of Hogwarts.
“‘I think the appointment of the Inquisitor is a first step toward ensuring
that Hogwarts has a headmaster in whom we can all repose confidence,’ said
a Ministry insider last night.
“Wizengamot elders Griselda Marchbanks and Tiberius Ogden have
resigned in protest at the introduction of the post of Inquisitor to Hogwarts.
“‘Hogwarts is a school, not an outpost of Cornelius Fudge’s office,’ said
Madam Marchbanks. ‘This is a further disgusting attempt to discredit Albus
Dumbledore.’ (For a full account of Madam Marchbanks’ alleged links to
subversive goblin groups, turn to page 17.)”
Hermione finished reading and looked across the table at the other two.
“So now we know how we ended up with Umbridg pectations’
grade, I see. Then you would be required to undergo a stringent series of
character and aptitude tests at the Auror office. It’s a difficult career path,
Potter; they only take the best. In fact, I don’t think anybody has been taken
on in the last three years.”
At this moment Professor Umbridge gave a very tiny cough, as though she
was trying to see how quietly she could do it. Professor McGonagall ignored
her.
“You’ll want to know which subjects you ought to take, I suppose?” she
went on, talking a little more loudly than before.
“Yes,” said Harry. “Defense Against the Dark Arts, I suppose?”
“Naturally,” said Professor McGonagall crisply. “I would also advise —”
Professor Umbridge gave another cough, a little more audible this time.
Professor McGonagall closed her eyes for a moment, opened them again, and
continued as though nothing had happened.
“I would also advise Transfiguration, because Aurors frequently need to
Transfigure or Untransfigure in their work. And I ought to tell you now,
Potter,"
What does the Polyjuice Potion do?,Transforms the drinker into someone else,"The Polyjuice Potion is a complex potion that allows a witch or wizard to transform into someone else. It requires a bit of the person's hair or body to be added to the potion, and it seems to have a painful transformation process, as depicted in the illustrations."," a witch
sprouting several extra pairs of arms out of her head.
“Here it is,” said Hermione excitedly as she found the page headed 
The
Polyjuice Potion.
 It was decorated with drawings of people halfway through
transforming into other people. Harry sincerely hoped the artist had imagined
the looks of intense pain on their faces.
“This is the most complicated potion I’ve ever seen,” said Hermione as
they scanned the recipe. “Lacewing flies, leeches, fluxweed, and knotgrass,”
she murmured, running her finger down the list of ingredients. “Well, they’re
easy enough, they’re in the student store-cupboard, we can help ourselves. . . .
Oooh, look, powdered horn of a bicorn — don’t know where we’re going to
get that — shredded skin of a boomslang — that’ll be tricky, too — and of
course a bit of whoever we want to change into.”
“Excuse me?” said Ron sharply. “What d’you mean, a bit of whoever we’re
changing into? I’m drinking 
nothing
 with Crabbe’s toenails in it —”
Hermione continued as though she hadn’t heard hi see him, but
he seems in no immediate danger.”
Harry did as he was told; Dumbledore covered Moody in the cloak, tucked
it around him, and clambered out of the trunk again. Then he picked up the
hip flask that stood upon the desk, unscrewed it, and turned it over. A thick
glutinous liquid splattered onto the office floor.
“Polyjuice Potion, Harry,” said Dumbledore. “You see the simplicity of it,and the brilliance. For Moody never 
does
 drink except from his hip flask, he’s
well known for it. The imposter needed, of course, to keep the real Moody
close by, so that he could continue making the potion. You see his hair . . .”
Dumbledore looked down on the Moody in the trunk. “The imposter has been
cutting it off all year, see where it is uneven? But I think, in the excitement of
tonight, our fake Moody might have forgotten to take it as frequently as he
should have done . . . on the hour . . . every hour. . . . We shall see.”
Dumbledore pulled out the chair at the desk and sat down upon it, his eyes
fixed upon t  a month or so, you feel like explaining, you will let us know, won’t
you?” said Ron irritably.
“All right,” said Hermione coldly. “What we’d need to do is to get inside
the Slytherin common room and ask Malfoy a few questions without him
realizing it’s us.”
“But that’s impossible,” Harry said as Ron laughed.
“No, it’s not,” said Hermione. “All we’d need would be some Polyjuice
Potion.”
“What’s that?” said Ron and Harry together.
“Snape mentioned it in class a few weeks ago —”
“D’you think we’ve got nothing better to do in Potions than listen to
Snape?” muttered Ron.
“It transforms you into somebody else. Think about it! We could change
into three of the Slytherins. No one would know it was us. Malfoy would
probably tell us anything. He’s probably boasting about it in the Slytherin
common room right now, if only we could hear him.”
“This Polyjuice stuff sounds a bit dodgy to me,” said Ron, frowning. “What
if we were stuck looking like three of the Slytherins forever?”
“It wears off after a while,” said Hermio  this one is?”
He indicated the cauldron nearest the Slytherin table. Harry raised himself
slightly in his seat and saw what looked like plain water boiling away inside
it.
Hermione’s well-practiced hand hit the air before anybody else’s; Slughorn
pointed at her.
“It’s Veritaserum, a colorless, odorless potion that forces the drinker to tell
the truth,” said Hermione.
“Very good, very good!” said Slughorn happily. “Now,” he continued,
pointing at the cauldron nearest the Ravenclaw table, “this one here is pretty
well known. . . . Featured in a few Ministry leaflets lately too . . . Who can —
?”
Hermione’s hand was fastest once more.
“It’s Polyjuice Potion, sir,” she said.
Harry too had recognized the slow-bubbling, mudlike substance in the
second cauldron, but did not resent Hermione getting the credit for answering
the question; she, after all, was the one who had succeeded in making it, back
in their second year.
“Excellent, excellent! Now, this one here . . . yes, my dear?” said Slughorn,
now looking sligh  immediately exuded so much juice he was amazed the
shriveled bean could have held it all. Hastily scooping it all into the cauldron
he saw, to his surprise, that the potion immediately turned exactly the shade of
lilac described by the textbook.
His annoyance with the previous owner vanishing on the spot, Harry now
squinted at the next line of instructions. According to the book, he had to stir
counterclockwise until the potion turned clear as water. According to the
addition the previous owner had made, however, he ought to add a clockwise
stir after every seventh counterclockwise stir. Could the old owner be right
twice?
Harry stirred counterclockwise, held his breath, and stirred once clockwise.
The effect was immediate. The potion turned palest pink.
“How are you doing that?” demanded Hermione, who was red-faced and
whose hair was growing bushier and bushier in the fumes from her cauldron;
her potion was still resolutely purple.
“Add a clockwise stir —”
“No, no, the book says counterclockwise!” she snapp letely clear potion. Harry stared at it.
“Do you know what this is, Potter?” Snape said, his eyes glittering
dangerously again.
“No,” said Harry, with complete honesty this time.
“It is Veritaserum — a Truth Potion so powerful that three drops would
have you spilling your innermost secrets for this entire class to hear,” said
Snape viciously. “Now, the use of this potion is controlled by very strict
Ministry guidelines. But unless you watch your step, you might just find that
my hand 
slips
” — he shook the crystal bottle slightly — “right over your
evening pumpkin juice. And then, Potter . . . then we’ll find out whether
you’ve been in my office or not.”
Harry said nothing. He turned back to his ginger roots once more, picked
up his knife, and started slicing them again. He didn’t like the sound of thatTruth Potion at all, nor would he put it past Snape to slip him some. He
repressed a shudder at the thought of what might come spilling out of his
mouth if Snape did it . . . quite apart from landing a whole l ook Millicent Bulstrode’s hair out of its bottle into
the first glass.
The potion hissed loudly like a boiling kettle and frothed madly. A second
later, it had turned a sick sort of yellow.“Urgh — essence of Millicent Bulstrode,” said Ron, eyeing it with
loathing. “Bet it tastes disgusting.”
“Add yours, then,” said Hermione.
Harry dropped Goyle’s hair into the middle glass and Ron put Crabbe’s into
the last one. Both glasses hissed and frothed: Goyle’s turned the khaki color
of a booger, Crabbe’s a dark, murky brown.
“Hang on,” said Harry as Ron and Hermione reached for their glasses.
“We’d better not all drink them in here. . . . Once we turn into Crabbe and
Goyle we won’t fit. And Millicent Bulstrode’s no pixie.”
“Good thinking,” said Ron, unlocking the door. “We’ll take separate stalls.”
Careful not to spill a drop of his Polyjuice Potion, Harry slipped into the
middle stall.
“Ready?” he called.
“Ready,” came Ron’s and Hermione’s voices.
“One — two — three —”
Pinching his nose, Harry drank the potion down   way, please, Harry,” said Dumbledore. He raised his wand and
made complicated movements over the surface of the potion, murmuring
soundlessly. Nothing happened, except perhaps that the potion glowed a little
brighter. Harry remained silent while Dumbledore worked, but after a while
Dumbledore withdrew his wand, and Harry felt it was safe to talk again.
“You think the Horcrux is in there, sir?”
“Oh yes.” Dumbledore peered more closely into the basin. Harry saw his
face reflected, upside down, in the smooth surface of the green potion. “But
how to reach it? This potion cannot be penetrated by hand, Vanished, parted,
scooped up, or siphoned away, nor can it be Transfigured, Charmed, or
otherwise made to change its nature.”
Almost absentmindedly, Dumbledore raised his wand again, twirled it once
in midair, and then caught the crystal goblet that he had conjured out of
nowhere.
“I can only conclude that this potion is supposed to be drunk.”
“What?” said Harry. “No!”
“Yes, I think so: Only by drinking it can I emp"
What is the name of Voldemort's snake?,Nagini,The name of Voldemort's snake is Nagini.," snake emerged to climb slowly up Voldemort’s chair. It rose,
seemingly endlessly, and came to rest across Voldemort’s shoulders: its neck
the thickness of a man’s thigh; its eyes, with their vertical slits for pupils,
unblinking. Voldemort stroked the creature absently with long thin fingers,
still looking at Lucius Malfoy.
“Why do the Malfoys look so unhappy with their lot? Is my return, my riseto power, not the very thing they professed to desire for so many years?”
“Of course, my Lord,” said Lucius Malfoy. His hand shook as he wiped
sweat from his upper lip. “We did desire it — we do.”
To Malfoy’s left, his wife made an odd, stiff nod, her eyes averted from
Voldemort and the snake. To his right, his son, Draco, who had been gazing
up at the inert body overhead, glanced quickly at Voldemort and away again,
terrified to make eye contact.
“My Lord,” said a dark woman halfway down the table, her voice
constricted with emotion, “it is an honor to have you here, in our family’s
house. There can be no higher ple kill the snake, and the snake was where Voldemort was,
and Voldemort was at the end of this tunnel. . . .
“Harry, we’re coming, just get in there!” said Ron, pushing him forward.
Harry wriggled into the earthy passage hidden in the tree’s roots. It was a
much tighter squeeze than it had been the last time they had entered it. The
tunnel was low-ceilinged: They had had to double up to move through it
nearly four years previously; now there was nothing for it but to crawl. Harry
went first, his wand illuminated, expecting at any moment to meet barriers,
but none came. They moved in silence, Harry’s gaze fixed upon the swinging
beam of the wand held in his fist.
At last the tunnel began to slope upward and Harry saw a sliver of light
ahead. Hermione tugged at his ankle.
“The Cloak!” she whispered. “Put the Cloak on!”
He groped behind him and she forced the bundle of slippery cloth into his
free hand. With difficulty he dragged it over himself, murmured, 
“Nox,”
extinguishing his wandlight, and continued on his h our greatest weakness —”
Another jet of green light flew from behind the silver shield. This time it
was the one-armed centaur, galloping in front of Dumbledore, that took the
blast and shattered into a hundred pieces, but before the fragments had even
hit the floor, Dumbledore had drawn back his wand and waved it as though
brandishing a whip. A long thin flame flew from the tip; it wrapped itself
around Voldemort, shield and all. For a moment, it seemed Dumbledore had
won, but then the fiery rope became a serpent, which relinquished its hold
upon Voldemort at once and turned, hissing furiously, to face Dumbledore.
Voldemort vanished. The snake reared from the floor, ready to strike —
There was a burst of flame in midair above Dumbledore just as Voldemort
reappeared, standing on the plinth in the middle of the pool where so recently
the five statues had stood.
“Look out!” 
Harry yelled.
But even as he shouted, one more jet of green light had flown at
Dumbledore from Voldemort’s wand and the snake had struck — ued to stand there, twirling the wand between his fingers,
staring at it.
“It is the only way, Nagini,” he whispered, and he looked around, and there
was the great thick snake, now suspended in midair, twisting gracefully
within the enchanted, protected space he had made for her, a starry,
transparent sphere somewhere between glittering cage and tank.
With a gasp, Harry pulled back and opened his eyes; at the same momenthis ears were assaulted with the screeches and cries, the smashes and bangs of
battle.
“He’s in the Shrieking Shack. The snake’s with him, it’s got some sort of
magical protection around it. He’s just sent Lucius Malfoy to find Snape.”
“Voldemort’s sitting in the Shrieking Shack?” said Hermione, outraged.
“He’s not — he’s not even 
fighting
?”
“He doesn’t think he needs to fight,” said Harry. “He thinks I’m going to go
to him.”
“But why?”
“He knows I’m after Horcruxes — he’s keeping Nagini close beside him —
obviously I’m going to have to go to him to get near the thing —”
“Right,” said Ron, s vant I needed, and, poor wizard though he is,
Wormtail was able to follow the instructions I gave him, which would return
me to a rudimentary, weak body of my own, a body I would be able to inhabit
while awaiting the essential ingredients for true rebirth . . . a spell or two of
my own invention . . . a little help from my dear Nagini,” Voldemort’s red
eyes fell upon the continually circling snake, “a potion concocted from
unicorn blood, and the snake venom Nagini provided . . . I was soon returnedto an almost human form, and strong enough to travel.
“There was no hope of stealing the Sorcerer’s Stone anymore, for I knew
that Dumbledore would have seen to it that it was destroyed. But I was
willing to embrace mortal life again, before chasing immortality. I set my
sights lower . . . I would settle for my old body back again, and my old
strength.
“I knew that to achieve this — it is an old piece of Dark Magic, the potion
that revived me tonight — I would need three powerful ingredients. Well, one
of them was a 
come a time when Lord Voldemort will seem to fear for the life of his snake.”
“For Nagini?” Snape looked astonished.
“Precisely. If there comes a time when Lord Voldemort stops sending that
snake forth to do his bidding, but keeps it safe beside him under magicalprotection, then, I think, it will be safe to tell Harry.”
“Tell him what?”
Dumbledore took a deep breath and closed his eyes.
“Tell him that on the night Lord Voldemort tried to kill him, when Lily cast
her own life between them as a shield, the Killing Curse rebounded upon
Lord Voldemort, and a fragment of Voldemort’s soul was blasted apart from
the whole, and latched itself onto the only living soul left in that collapsing
building. Part of Lord Voldemort lives inside Harry, and it is that which gives
him the power of speech with snakes, and a connection with Lord
Voldemort’s mind that he has never understood. And while that fragment of
soul, unmissed by Voldemort, remains attached to and protected by Harry,
Lord Voldemort cannot die.”
Harry seeme and drew out a wand. He caressed it gently
too; and then he raised it, and pointed it at Wormtail, who was lifted off the
ground and thrown against the headstone where Harry was tied; he fell to the
foot of it and lay there, crumpled up and crying. Voldemort turned his scarlet
eyes upon Harry, laughing a high, cold, mirthless laugh.
Wormtail’s robes were shining with blood now; he had wrapped the stump
of his arm in them.
“My Lord . . .” he choked, “my Lord . . . you promised . . . you did
promise . . .”
“Hold out your arm,” said Voldemort lazily.
“Oh Master . . . thank you, Master . . .”He extended the bleeding stump, but Voldemort laughed again.
“The other arm, Wormtail.”
“Master, please . . . 
please
 . . .”
Voldemort bent down and pulled out Wormtail’s left arm; he forced the
sleeve of Wormtail’s robes up past his elbow, and Harry saw something upon
the skin there, something like a vivid red tattoo — 
a skull with a snake
protruding from its mouth — the image that had appeared in the sky at the
Quidditch  e getting
to the bottom of this business. He had moved forward in his chair so that,
without realizing it, he was perched on the very edge, tense as though poised
for flight.
“How come I saw through the snake’s eyes if it’s Voldemort’s thoughts I’m
sharing?”
“Do not say the Dark Lord’s name!” 
spat Snape.
There was a nasty silence. They glared at each other across the Pensieve.
“Professor Dumbledore says his name,” said Harry quietly.
“Dumbledore is an extremely powerful wizard,” Snape muttered. “While
he 
may feel secure enough to use the name . . . the rest of us . . .” He rubbed
his left forearm, apparently unconsciously, on the spot where Harry knew the
Dark Mark was burned into his skin.
“I just wanted to know,” Harry began again, forcing his voice back to
politeness, “why —”
“You seem to have visited the snake’s mind because that was where the
Dark Lord was at that particular moment,” snarled Snape. “He was possessingthe snake at the time and so you dreamed you were inside it too . . .”
“And Vol — he — "

A second newspaper lay beside the first. This one bore the headline:
SCRIMGEOUR SUCCEEDS FUDGE
Most of this front page was taken up with a large black-and-white picture
of a man with a lionlike mane of thick hair and a rather ravaged face. The
picture was moving — the man was waving at the ceiling.
Rufus Scrimgeour, previously Head of the Auror office in the
Department of Magical Law Enforcement, has succeeded Cornelius
Fudge as Minister of Magic. The appointment has largely been greeted
with enthusiasm by the Wizarding community, though rumors of a rift
between the new Minister and Albus Dumbledore, newly reinstated
Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, surfaced within hours of Scrimgeour
taking office.
Scrimgeour’s representatives admitted  nspiring and the best loved of all Hogwarts headmasters cannot be in
question. He died as he lived: working always for the greater good and,
to his last hour, as willing to stretch out a hand to a small boy with
dragon pox as he was on the day that I met him.
Harry finished reading but continued to gaze at the picture accompanying
the obituary. Dumbledore was wearing his familiar, kindly smile, but as he
peered over the top of his half-moon spectacles, he gave the impression, even
in newsprint, of X-raying Harry, whose sadness mingled with a sense of
humiliation.
He had thought he knew Dumbledore quite well, but ever since reading this
obituary he had been forced to recognize that he had barely known him at all.
Never once had he imagined Dumbledore’s childhood or youth; it was as
though he had sprung into being as Harry had known him, venerable and
silver-haired and old. The idea of a teenage Dumbledore was simply odd, like
trying to imagine a stupid Hermione or a friendly Blast-Ended Skrewt.
He had never th tyle . . .”

BY ORDER OF

The Ministry of Magic
 
Dolores Jane Umbridge (High Inquisitor) has replaced Albus
Dumbledore as Head of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
 
The above is in accordance with Educational Decree Number Twenty-
eight.
The notices had gone up all over the school overnight, but they did not
explain how every single person within the castle seemed to know that
Dumbledore had overcome two Aurors, the High Inquisitor, the Minister of
Magic, and his Junior Assistant to escape. No matter where Harry went withinthe castle next day, the sole topic of conversation was Dumbledore’s flight,
and though some of the details might have gone awry in the retelling (Harry
overheard one second-year girl assuring another that Fudge was now lying in
St. Mungo’s with a pumpkin for a head), it was surprising how accurate the
rest of their information was. Everybody seemed aware, for instance, that
Harry and Marietta were the only students to have w that he had met with
Dumbledore at once upon taking possession of the top job, but refused to
comment on the topics under discussion. Albus Dumbledore is known to

To the left of this paper sat another, which had been folded so that a storybearing the title 
MINISTRY GUARANTEES STUDENTS’ SAFETY
 was visible.
Newly appointed Minister of Magic, Rufus Scrimgeour, spoke today of
the tough new measures taken by his Ministry to ensure the safety of
students returning to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this
autumn.
“For obvious reasons, the Ministry will not be going into detail about
its stringent new security plans,” said the Minister, although an insider
confirmed that measures include defensive spells and charms, a complex
array of countercurses, and a small task force of Aurors dedicated solely
to the protection of Hogwarts School.
Most seem reassured by the new Minister’s tough stand on student
safety. Said Mrs. Augusta Longbottom, “My grandson, Neville — a
good friend of Ha t to grips with
what some are calling the “falling standards” at Hogwarts,’ said Weasley.
‘The Inquisitor will have powers to inspect her fellow educators and make
sure that they are coming up to scratch. Professor Umbridge has been offered
this position in addition to her own teaching post, and we are delighted to say
that she has accepted.’
“The Ministry’s new moves have received enthusiastic support from parents
of students at Hogwarts.
“‘I feel much easier in my mind now that I know that Dumbledore is being
subjected to fair and objective evaluation,’ said Mr. Lucius Malfoy, 41,
speaking from his Wiltshire mansion last night. ‘Many of us with our
children’s best interests at heart have been concerned about some of
Dumbledore’s eccentric decisions in the last few years and will be glad to
know that the Ministry is keeping an eye on the situation.’“Among those ‘eccentric decisions’ are undoubtedly the controversial staff
appointments previously described in this newspaper, which have included the
hiring of  bed.
“Just trying to decide which ones to take with us,” said Hermione. “When
we’re looking for the Horcruxes.”
“Oh, of course,” said Ron, clapping a hand to his forehead. “I forgot we’ll
be hunting down Voldemort in a mobile library.”
“Ha ha,” said Hermione, looking down at 
Spellman’s Syllabary. 
“I
wonder . . . will we need to translate runes? It’s possible. . . . I think we’d
better take it, to be safe.”
She dropped the syllabary onto the larger of the two piles and picked up
Hogwarts: A History.
“Listen,” said Harry.
He had sat up straight. Ron and Hermione looked at him with similar
mixtures of resignation and defiance.
“I know you said after Dumbledore’s funeral that you wanted to come with
me,” Harry began.
“Here he goes,” Ron said to Hermione, rolling his eyes.
“As we knew he would,” she sighed, turning back to the books. “You
know, I think I 
will 
take 
Hogwarts: A History.
 Even if we’re not going backthere, I don’t think I’d feel right if I didn’t have it with —”
“Listen!” said Harry again.
“No, "
What does the Mirror of Erised show?,The deepest desire of one's heart,"According to the text, the Mirror of Erised shows each person what they most desire or deeply long for. It can show them their deepest, most desperate desire of their hearts, which may or may not be real or possible.","ized by now what it does?”
“It — well — it shows me my family —”
“And it showed your friend Ron himself as Head Boy.”
“How did you know — ?”
“I don’t need a cloak to become invisible,” said Dumbledore gently. “Now,
can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?”
Harry shook his head.
“Let me explain. The happiest man on earth would be able to use the
Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it and see
himself exactly as he is. Does that help?”
Harry thought. Then he said slowly, “It shows us what we want . . .
whatever we want . . .”
“Yes and no,” said Dumbledore quietly. “It shows us nothing more or less
than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts. You, who have never
known your family, see them standing around you. Ronald Weasley, who has
always been overshadowed by his brothers, sees himself standing alone, the
best of all of them. However, this mirror will give us neither knowledge or
truth. Men have wasted away before it, entranced by what they have seen, or
bee n driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible.
“The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow, Harry, and I ask you
not to go looking for it again. If you ever 
do
 run across it, you will now be
prepared. It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, remember that.
Now, why don’t you put that admirable Cloak back on and get off to bed?”Harry stood up.
“Sir — Professor Dumbledore? Can I ask you something?”
“Obviously, you’ve just done so,” Dumbledore smiled. “You may ask me
one more thing, however.”
“What do you see when you look in the mirror?”
“I? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.”
Harry stared.
“One can never have enough socks,” said Dumbledore. “Another Christmas
has come and gone and I didn’t get a single pair. People will insist on giving
me books.”
It was only when he was back in bed that it struck Harry that Dumbledore
might not have been quite truthful. But then, he thought, as he shoved
Scabbers off his pillow, it had been quite a personal question.D , pulled it out from underneath his trainers, and examined it.
He realized what it was within seconds. Sirius had given it to him just
inside the front door of twelve Grimmauld Place. 
Use it if you need me, all
right?
Harry sank down onto his bed and unwrapped the package. Out fell a small,square mirror. It looked old; it was certainly dirty. Harry held it up to his face
and saw his own reflection looking back at him.
He turned the mirror over. There on the reverse side was a scribbled note
from Sirius.
This is a two-way mirror. I’ve got the other. If you need to speak to me,
just say my name into it; you’ll appear in my mirror and I’ll be able to
talk in yours. James and I used to use them when we were in separate
detentions.
And Harry’s heart began to race. He remembered seeing his dead parents in
the Mirror of Erised four years ago. He was going to be able to talk to Sirius
again, right now, he knew it —
He looked around to make sure there was nobody else there; the dormitory
was quite empty. He looked ba  knew you’d seen me coming to look at what was guarding
the Stone.”
“
You
 let the troll in?”
“Certainly. I have a special gift with trolls — you must have seen what I
did to the one in the chamber back there? Unfortunately, while everyone else
was running around looking for it, Snape, who already suspected me, went
straight to the third floor to head me off — and not only did my troll fail to
beat you to death, that three-headed dog didn’t even manage to bite Snape’s
leg off properly.
“Now, wait quietly, Potter. I need to examine this interesting mirror.”
It was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell. It
was the Mirror of Erised.
“This mirror is the key to finding the Stone,” Quirrell murmured, tapping
his way around the frame. “Trust Dumbledore to come up with something like
this . . . but he’s in London . . . I’ll be far away by the time he gets back. . . .”
All Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and stop him
from concentrating on the mirror.
“I saw you and Sna ole it, really?
“Are you all right?” said Ron. “You look odd.”
What Harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror room
again. With Ron covered in the Cloak, too, they had to walk much more
slowly the next night. They tried retracing Harry’s route from the library,
wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour.
“I’m freezing,” said Ron. “Let’s forget it and go back.”
“No!”
 Harry hissed. “I know it’s here somewhere.”
They passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite direction, but
saw no one else. Just as Ron started moaning that his feet were dead with
cold, Harry spotted the suit of armor.
“It’s here — just here — yes!”
They pushed the door open. Harry dropped the Cloak from around his
shoulders and ran to the mirror.
There they were. His mother and father beamed at the sight of him.
“See?” Harry whispered.
“I can’t see anything.”
“Look! Look at them all . . . there are loads of them. . . .”
“I can only see you.”“Look in it properly, go on, stand where I am.”
Harry ruly renders the wearer completely invisible,
and endures eternally, giving constant and impenetrable concealment, no
matter what spells are cast at it. How many cloaks have you ever seen like
that,
 Miss Granger?”
Hermione opened her mouth to answer, then closed it again, looking more
confused than ever. She, Harry, and Ron glanced at one another, and Harry
knew that they were all thinking the same thing. It so happened that a cloak
exactly like the one Xenophilius had just described was in the room with them
at that very moment.
“Exactly,” said Xenophilius, as if he had defeated them all in reasoned
argument. “None of you have ever seen such a thing. The possessor would be
immeasurably rich, would he not?”
He glanced out of the window again. The sky was now tinged with the
faintest trace of pink.
“All right,” said Hermione, disconcerted. “Say the Cloak existed . . . what
about the stone, Mr. Lovegood? The thing you call the Resurrection Stone?”
“What of it?”
“Well, how can that be real?”
“Prove that it is n ed against the wall,
breathing deeply, listening to their footsteps dying away. That had been close,
very close. It was a few seconds before he noticed anything about the room he
had hidden in.
It looked like an unused classroom. The dark shapes of desks and chairs
were piled against the walls, and there was an upturned wastepaper basket —
but propped against the wall facing him was something that didn’t look as if it
belonged there, something that looked as if someone had just put it there to
keep it out of the way.
It was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold
frame, standing on two clawed feet. There was an inscription carved around
the top: 
Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi.
His panic fading now that there was no sound of Filch and Snape, Harry
moved nearer to the mirror, wanting to look at himself but see no reflection
again. He stepped in front of it.
He had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming. He
whirled around. His heart was pounding far  side
 the mirror? Should I break it?”
Harry’s mind was racing.What I want more than anything else in the world at the moment,
 he
thought
, is to find the Stone before Quirrell does. So if I look in the mirror, I
should see myself finding it — which means I’ll see where it’s hidden! But
how can I look without Quirrell realizing what I’m up to?
He tried to edge to the left, to get in front of the glass without Quirrell
noticing, but the ropes around his ankles were too tight: he tripped and fell
over. Quirrell ignored him. He was still talking to himself.
“What does this mirror do? How does it work? Help me, Master!”
And to Harry’s horror, a voice answered, and the voice seemed to come
from Quirrell himself.
“Use the boy . . . Use the boy . . .”
Quirrell rounded on Harry.
“Yes — Potter — come here.”
He clapped his hands once, and the ropes binding Harry fell off. Harry got
slowly to his feet.
“Come here,” Quirrell repeated. “Look in the mirror and tell me what you
see.”
Harry walked toward him.
I must lie,
 he"
What plant screams when uprooted?,Mandrake,The plant that screams when uprooted is Devil's Snare.," stopped. There was a loud bark from the dog, but
Hermione had already jumped. She landed on Harry’s other side.
“We must be miles under the school,” she said.
“Lucky this plant thing’s here, really,” said Ron.
“Lucky!”
 shrieked Hermione. “Look at you both!”
She leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. She had to struggle
because the moment she had landed, the plant had started to twist snakelike
tendrils around her ankles. As for Harry and Ron, their legs had already been
bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing.
Hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on
her. Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off
them, but the more they strained against it, the tighter and faster the plant
wound around them.
“Stop moving!” Hermione ordered them. “I know what this is — it’s
Devil’s Snare!”
“Oh, I’m so glad we know what it’s called, that’s a great help,” snarled
Ron, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck.
“Shut up, I’m and lift him off the ground, so that he was hanging facedown.
Struggling, terrified, he heard more clicking, and saw Ron’s legs leave the
ground, too, heard Fang whimpering and howling — next moment, he was
being swept away into the dark trees.
Head hanging, Harry saw that what had hold of him was marching on six
immensely long, hairy legs, the front two clutching him tightly below a pair
of shining black pincers. Behind him, he could hear another of the creatures,
no doubt carrying Ron. They were moving into the very heart of the forest.
Harry could hear Fang fighting to free himself from a third monster, whining
loudly, but Harry couldn’t have yelled even if he had wanted to; he seemed to
have left his voice back with the car in the clearing.He never knew how long he was in the creature’s clutches; he only knew
that the darkness suddenly lifted enough for him to see that the leaf-strewn
ground was now swarming with spiders. Craning his neck sideways, he
realized that they had reached the ridge of a vast hol . Harry could feel Fang’s hot breath
on his hand. More than once, they had to stop, so that Harry could crouch
down and find the spiders in the wandlight.
They walked for what seemed like at least half an hour, their robes
snagging on low-slung branches and brambles. After a while, they noticedthat the ground seemed to be sloping downward, though the trees were as
thick as ever.
Then Fang suddenly let loose a great, echoing bark, making both Harry and
Ron jump out of their skins.
“What?” said Ron loudly, looking around into the pitch-dark, and gripping
Harry’s elbow very hard.
“There’s something moving over there,” Harry breathed. “Listen . . .
sounds like something big. . . .”
They listened. Some distance to their right, the something big was snapping
branches as it carved a path through the trees.
“Oh, no,” said Ron. “Oh, no, oh, no, oh —”
“Shut up,” said Harry frantically. “It’ll hear you.”
“Hear 
me
?” said Ron in an unnaturally high voice. “It’s already heard
Fang!”
The darkness seemed to be pressing on  here?”
“
Your
 forest?” said Umbridge, shaking now not only with fright but also, it
seemed, with indignation. “I would remind you that you live here only
because the Ministry of Magic permits you certain areas of land —”
An arrow flew so close to her head that it caught at her mousy hair in
passing. She let out an earsplitting scream and threw her hands over her head
while some of the centaurs bellowed their approval and others laughed
raucously. The sound of their wild, neighing laughter echoing around the
dimly lit clearing and the sight of their pawing hooves was extremely
unnerving.“Whose forest is it now, human?” bellowed Bane.
“Filthy half-breeds!” she screamed, her hands still tight over her head.
“Beasts! Uncontrolled animals!”
“Be quiet!” shouted Hermione, but it was too late — Umbridge pointed her
wand at Magorian and screamed, 
“Incarcerous!”
Ropes flew out of midair like thick snakes, wrapping themselves tightly
around the centaur’s torso and trapping his arms. He gave a cry of rage and
reared on to his hind legs, attempting to free himself, while the other centaurs
charged.
Harry grabbed Hermione and pulled her to the ground. Facedown on the
forest floor he knew a moment of terror as hooves thundered around him, but
the centaurs leapt over and around them, bellowing and screaming with rage.
“Nooooo!” he heard Umbridge shriek. “Noooooo . . . I am Senior
Undersecretary . . . you cannot . . . unhand me, you animals . . . nooooo!”
He saw a flash of red light and knew that she had attempted to Stun one of
them — then she screamed very loudly. Lifting his head a few inches, Harry
saw that Umbridge had been seized from behind by Bane and lifted high into
the air, wriggling and yelling with fright. Her wand fell from her hand to the
ground and Harry’s heart leapt, if he could just reach it —
But as he stretched out a hand toward it, a centaur’s hoof descended upon
the wand and it broke cleanly in half.
“Now!” roared a voice in Harry’s ear and a thick hairy arm descended from
thin air and dragged him upright; led and
tangled.
“Are we going to bury him here, Hagrid, in your garden?”
“Jus’ beyond the pumpkin patch, I thought,” said Hagrid in a choked voice.
“I’ve already dug the — yeh know — grave. Jus’ thought we’d say a few nice
things over him — happy memories, yeh know —”
His voice quivered and broke. There was a knock on the door, and he
turned to answer it, blowing his nose on his great spotted handkerchief as he
did so. Slughorn hurried over the threshold, several bottles in his arms, and
wearing a somber black cravat.
“Hagrid,” he said, in a deep, grave voice. “So very sorry to hear of your
loss.”
“Tha’s very nice of yeh,” said Hagrid. “Thanks a lot. An’ thanks fer not
givin’ Harry detention neither. . . .”
“Wouldn’t have dreamed of it,” said Slughorn. “Sad night, sad night . . .
Where is the poor creature?”“Out here,” said Hagrid in a shaking voice. “Shall we — shall we do it,
then?”
The three of them stepped out into the back garden. The moon was
glistening palely through the trees now, and its rays mingle et Neville up the steps!
What do you think Voldemort’ll say about that, then?”
His scar seared and burned. . . . The pain of it was making his eyes
stream. . . .
“LIAR!” she shrieked, but he could hear the terror behind the anger now.
“YOU’VE GOT IT, POTTER, AND YOU WILL GIVE IT TO ME — 
Accio
Prophecy! ACCIO PROPHECY!
”
Harry laughed again because he knew it would incense her, the pain
building in his head so badly he thought his skull might burst. He waved hisempty hand from behind the one-eared goblin and withdrew it quickly as she
sent another jet of green light flying at him.
“Nothing there!” he shouted. “Nothing to summon! It smashed and nobody
heard what it said, tell your boss that —”
“No!” she screamed. “It isn’t true, you’re lying — MASTER, I TRIED, I
TRIED — DO NOT PUNISH ME —”
“Don’t waste your breath!” yelled Harry, his eyes screwed up against the
pain in his scar, now more terrible than ever. “He can’t hear you from here!”
“Can’t I, Potter?” said a high, cold voice.
Harry opened his eyes.
Tall,  some bizarre, many-lipped oyster.
“Stop it!” shrieked Petunia.
“It’s not hurting you,” said Lily, but she closed her hand on the blossom
and threw it back to the ground.
“It’s not right,” said Petunia, but her eyes had followed the flower’s flight
to the ground and lingered upon it. “How do you do it?” she added, and there
was definite longing in her voice.
“It’s obvious, isn’t it?” Snape could no longer contain himself, but had
jumped out from behind the bushes. Petunia shrieked and ran backward
toward the swings, but Lily, though clearly startled, remained where she was.
Snape seemed to regret his appearance. A dull flush of color mounted the
sallow cheeks as he looked at Lily.
“What’s obvious?” asked Lily.
Snape had an air of nervous excitement. With a glance at the distant
Petunia, now hovering beside the swings, he lowered his voice and said, “I
know what you are.”
“What do you mean?”
“You’re . . . you’re a witch,” whispered Snape.
She looked affronted.
“
That’s
 not a very nice thing to say to somebody!"
Who is the half-giant who befriends Harry?,Rubeus Hagrid,The half-giant who befriends Harry is Hagrid.,"caped to one of
the giant communities still existing in foreign mountain ranges. If
his antics during Care of Magical Creatures lessons are any guide,
however, Fridwulfa’s son appears to have inherited her brutal
nature.
In a bizarre twist, Hagrid is reputed to have developed a close
friendship with the boy who brought around You-Know-Who’s fall
from power — thereby driving Hagrid’s own mother, like the rest of
You-Know-Who’s supporters, into hiding. Perhaps Harry Potter is
unaware of the unpleasant truth about his large friend — but Albus
Dumbledore surely has a duty to ensure that Harry Potter, along
with his fellow students, is warned about the dangers of associating
with part-giants.
Harry finished reading and looked up at Ron, whose mouth was hanging
open.
“How did she find out?” he whispered.
But that wasn’t what was bothering Harry.
“What d’you mean, ‘we all hate Hagrid’?” Harry spat at Malfoy. “What’s
this rubbish about 
him
”
 — 
he pointed at Crabbe — “getting a bad bite off a
flobberworm? They have ,” she added, as Harry and Ron rolled their eyes, “because I’m
starting to think this Prince character was a bit dodgy.”
Both Harry and Ron shouted her down at once.
“It was a laugh!” said Ron, upending a ketchup bottle over his sausages.
“Just a laugh, Hermione, that’s all!”
“Dangling people upside down by the ankle?” said Hermione. “Who puts
their time and energy into making up spells like that?”
“Fred and George,” said Ron, shrugging, “it’s their kind of thing. And, er
—”
“My dad,” said Harry. He had only just remembered.
“What?” said Ron and Hermione together.
“My dad used this spell,” said Harry. “I — Lupin told me.”
This last part was not true; in fact, Harry had seen his father use the spell
on Snape, but he had never told Ron and Hermione about that particular
excursion into the Pensieve. Now, however, a wonderful possibility occurred
to him. Could the Half-Blood Prince possibly be — ?
“Maybe your dad did use it, Harry,” said Hermione, “but he’s not the only
one. We’ve seen a whole bunch of people use ave half a mind to leave now!”
“Empty threat, Karkaroff,” growled a voice from near the door. “You can’t
leave your champion now. He’s got to compete. They’ve all got to compete.
Binding magical contract, like Dumbledore said. Convenient, eh?”
Moody had just entered the room. He limped toward the fire, and with
every right step he took, there was a loud 
clunk.
“Convenient?” said Karkaroff. “I’m afraid I don’t understand you, Moody.”
Harry could tell he was trying to sound disdainful, as though what Moody
was saying was barely worth his notice, but his hands gave him away; they
had balled themselves into fists.
“Don’t you?” said Moody quietly. “It’s very simple, Karkaroff. Someone
put Potter’s name in that goblet knowing he’d have to compete if it came
out.”
“Evidently, someone ’oo wished to give ’Ogwarts two bites at ze apple!”
said Madame Maxime.
“I quite agree, Madame Maxime,” said Karkaroff, bowing to her. “I shall be
lodging complaints with the Ministry of Magic 
and
 the International
Confederation of W . He’s massive, one o’
the biggest ones there. Black hair an’ matchin’ teeth an’ a necklace o’ bones.
Human-lookin’ bones, some of ’em. Well, I gave it a go — held out a great
roll o’ dragon skin — an’ said ‘A gift fer the Gurg of the giants —’ Nex’ thing
I knew, I was hangin’ upside down in the air by me feet, two of his mates had
grabbed me.”
Hermione clapped her hands to her mouth.
“How did you get out of 
that
?” asked Harry.
“Wouldn’ta done if Olympe hadn’ bin there,” said Hagrid. “She pulled out
her wand an’ did some o’ the fastes’ spellwork I’ve ever seen. Ruddy
marvelous. Hit the two holdin’ me right in the eyes with Conjunctivitus
Curses an’ they dropped me straightaway — bu’ we were in trouble then,
’cause we’d used magic against ’em, an’ that’s what giants hate abou’
wizards. We had ter leg it an’ we knew there was no way we was going ter be
able ter march inter camp again.”
“Blimey, Hagrid,” said Ron quietly.“So how come it’s taken you so long to get home if you were only there for
three days?” as  doorway.
“Oh my — !” shrieked Hermione, as she and Ron caught up with Harry and
gazed upward at the giant now trying to seize people through the window
above.
“DON’T!” Ron yelled, grabbing Hermione’s hand as she raised her wand.
“Stun him and he’ll crush half the castle —”
“HAGGER?”
Grawp came lurching around the corner of the castle; only now did Harry
realize that Grawp was, indeed, an undersized giant. The gargantuan monster
trying to crush people on the upper floors looked around and let out a roar.
The stone steps trembled as he stomped toward his smaller kin, and Grawp’s
lopsided mouth fell open, showing yellow, half-brick-sized teeth; and then
they launched themselves at each other with the savagery of lions.
“RUN!” Harry roared; the night was full of hideous yells and blows as the
giants wrestled, and he seized Hermione’s hand and tore down the steps into
the grounds, Ron bringing up the rear. Harry had not lost hope of finding and
saving Hagrid; he ran so fast that they were halfway toward the fores ings at friends from other Houses, eyeing one another’s new haircuts and
robes. Again Harry noticed people putting their heads together to whisper as
he passed; he gritted his teeth and tried to act as though he neither noticed nor
cared.
Luna drifted away from them at the Ravenclaw table. The moment they
reached Gryffindor’s, Ginny was hailed by some fellow fourth years and left
to sit with them; Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Neville found seats together
about halfway down the table between Nearly Headless Nick, the Gryffindor
House ghost, and Parvati Patil and Lavender Brown, the last two of whom
gave Harry airy, overly friendly greetings that made him quite sure they had
stopped talking about him a split second before. He had more important
things to worry about, however: He was looking over the students’ heads to
the staff table that ran along the top wall of the Hall.
“He’s not there.”
Ron and Hermione scanned the staff table too, though there was no real
need; Hagrid’s size made him instantly obvious in any d the twin at whom Moody was pointing. “Can’t you
even tell us apart when we’re Harry?”
“Sorry, George —”
“I’m only yanking your wand, I’m Fred really —”
“Enough messing around!” snarled Moody. “The other one — George or
Fred or whoever you are — you’re with Remus. Miss Delacour —”
“I’m taking Fleur on a thestral,” said Bill. “She’s not that fond of brooms.”
Fleur walked over to stand beside him, giving him a soppy, slavish look
that Harry hoped with all his heart would never appear on his face again.
“Miss Granger with Kingsley, again by thestral —”
Hermione looked reassured as she answered Kingsley’s smile; Harry knew
that Hermione too lacked confidence on a broomstick.
“Which leaves you and me, Ron!” said Tonks brightly, knocking over a
mug tree as she waved at him.
Ron did not look quite as pleased as Hermione.
“An’ you’re with me, Harry. That all righ’?” said Hagrid, looking a littleanxious. “We’ll be on the bike, brooms an’ thestrals can’t take me weight, see.
Not a lot o’ room on the seat with me on it n
impregnable fortress. “When we get back to the common room tonight, we’ll
both have partners — agreed?”
“Er . . . okay,” said Harry.
But every time he glimpsed Cho that day — during break, and then
lunchtime, and once on the way to History of Magic — she was surrounded
by friends. Didn’t she 
ever
 go anywhere alone? Could he perhaps ambush her
as she was going into a bathroom? But no — she even seemed to go there
with an escort of four or five girls. Yet if he didn’t do it soon, she was bound
to have been asked by somebody else.
He found it hard to concentrate on Snape’s Potions test, and consequently
forgot to add the key ingredient — a bezoar — meaning that he received
bottom marks. He didn’t care, though; he was too busy screwing up his
courage for what he was about to do. When the bell rang, he grabbed his bag,
and hurried to the dungeon door.
“I’ll meet you at dinner,” he said to Ron and Hermione, and he dashed off
upstairs.
He’d just have to ask Cho for a private word, that was all. . . . He hurried
"
What does a Patronus do?,Repels Dementors,"According to the context, a Patronus is a kind of anti-dementor that acts as a shield between the wizard who conjures it and the dementors. It is a positive force that is a projection of the wizard's happy memories and cannot feel despair, making it immune to the dementors' effects.","ctly, it conjures up a Patronus,” said Lupin,
“which is a kind of anti-dementor — a guardian that acts as a shield between
you and the dementor.”
Harry had a sudden vision of himself crouching behind a Hagrid-sized
figure holding a large club. Professor Lupin continued, “The Patronus is a
kind of positive force, a projection of the very things that the dementor feeds
upon — hope, happiness, the desire to survive — but it cannot feel despair, as
real humans can, so the dementors can’t hurt it. But I must warn you, Harry,
that the charm might be too advanced for you. Many qualified wizards have
difficulty with it.”
“What does a Patronus look like?” said Harry curiously.
“Each one is unique to the wizard who conjures it.”
“And how do you conjure it?”“With an incantation, which will work only if you are concentrating, with
all your might, on a single, very happy memory.”
Harry cast his mind about for a happy memory. Certainly, nothing that had
happened to him at the Dursleys’ was going to do. Finally, he settled  lf, guilty about his secret desire to
hear his parents’ voices again.
“You’re expecting too much of yourself,” said Professor Lupin sternly in
their fourth week of practice. “For a thirteen-year-old wizard, even an
indistinct Patronus is a huge achievement. You aren’t passing out anymore,
are you?”
“I thought a Patronus would — charge the dementors down or something,”
said Harry dispiritedly. “Make them disappear —”“The true Patronus does do that,” said Lupin. “But you’ve achieved a great
deal in a very short space of time. If the dementors put in an appearance at
your next Quidditch match, you will be able to keep them at bay long enough
to get back to the ground.”
“You said it’s harder if there are loads of them,” said Harry.
“I have complete confidence in you,” said Lupin, smiling. “Here — you’ve
earned a drink — something from the Three Broomsticks. You won’t have
tried it before —”
He pulled two bottles out of his briefcase.
“Butterbeer!” said Harry, without thinking. “Yeah, I like that stuff!”
Lupin rai ad, come on —”
But no one came. Harry raised his head to look at the circle of dementors
across the lake. One of them was lowering its hood. It was time for the
rescuer to appear — but no one was coming to help this time —
And then it hit him — he understood. He hadn’t seen his father — he had
seen 
himself —
Harry flung himself out from behind the bush and pulled out his wand.
“EXPECTO PATRONUM!”
 he yelled.
And out of the end of his wand burst, not a shapeless cloud of mist, but a
blinding, dazzling, silver animal. He screwed up his eyes, trying to see what it
was. It looked like a horse. It was galloping silently away from him, across
the black surface of the lake. He saw it lower its head and charge at the
swarming dementors. . . . Now it was galloping around and around the black
shapes on the ground, and the dementors were falling back, scattering,
retreating into the darkness. . . . They were gone.
The Patronus turned. It was cantering back toward Harry across the still
surface of the water. It wasn’t a rl with the long plait down her back, looking
at Harry, “that you can produce a Patronus?”
There was a murmur of interest around the group at this.
“Yeah,” said Harry slightly defensively.
“A corporeal Patronus?”
The phrase stirred something in Harry’s memory.
“Er — you don’t know Madam Bones, do you?” he asked.
The girl smiled.
“She’s my auntie,” she said. “I’m Susan Bones. She told me about your
hearing. So — is it really true? You make a stag Patronus?”
“Yes,” said Harry.
“Blimey, Harry!” said Lee, looking deeply impressed. “I never knew that!”
“Mum told Ron not to spread it around,” said Fred, grinning at Harry. “She
said you got enough attention as it was.”
“She’s not wrong,” mumbled Harry and a couple of people laughed. The
veiled witch sitting alone shifted very slightly in her seat.
“And did you kill a basilisk with that sword in Dumbledore’s office?”
demanded Terry Boot. “That’s what one of the portraits on the wall told me
when I was in there last year . . .”
“Er — yeah, I did, yeah,” said Harry.
Ju y something like a
dementor.
“Oh, don’t be such a killjoy,” said Cho brightly, watching her silvery swan-
shaped Patronus soar around the Room of Requirement during their last
lesson before Easter. “They’re so pretty!”
“They’re not supposed to be pretty, they’re supposed to protect you,” said
Harry patiently. “What we really need is a boggart or something; that’s how I
learned, I had to conjure a Patronus while the boggart was pretending to be a
dementor —”
“But that would be really scary!” said Lavender, who was shooting puffs of
silver vapor out of the end of her wand. “And I still — can’t — do it!” she
added angrily.
Neville was having trouble too. His face was screwed up in concentration,
but only feeble wisps of silver smoke issued from his wand-tip.
“You’ve got to think of something happy,” Harry reminded him.
“I’m trying,” said Neville miserably, who was trying so hard his round face
was actually shining with sweat.
“Harry, I think I’m doing it!” yelled Seamus, who had been brought along
to his first e Remus?”
“No, I haven’t been in contact with anybody very much,” said Lupin. “But
Tonks has got her own family to go to, hasn’t she?”
“Hmmm,” said Mrs. Weasley. “Maybe. I got the impression she was
planning to spend Christmas alone, actually.”
She gave Lupin an annoyed look, as though it was all his fault she was
getting Fleur for a daughter-in-law instead of Tonks, but Harry, glancing
across at Fleur, who was now feeding Bill bits of turkey off her own fork,
thought that Mrs. Weasley was fighting a long-lost battle. He was, however,
reminded of a question he had with regard to Tonks, and who better to ask
than Lupin, the man who knew all about Patronuses?
“Tonks’s Patronus has changed its form,” he told him. “Snape said so
anyway. I didn’t know that could happen. Why would your Patronus change?”
Lupin took his time chewing his turkey and swallowing before saying
slowly, “Sometimes . . . a great shock . . . an emotional upheaval . . .”
“It looked big, and it had four legs,” said Harry, struck by a sudden thoug ver D.A. meeting by Dean. “Look — ah — it’s gone. . . . But it
was definitely something hairy, Harry!”
Hermione’s Patronus, a shining silver otter, was gamboling around her.
“They 
are
 sort of nice, aren’t they?” she said, looking at it fondly.
The door of the Room of Requirement opened and then closed again; Harry
looked around to see who had entered, but there did not seem to be anybodythere. It was a few moments before he realized that the people close to the
door had fallen silent. Next thing he knew, something was tugging at his robes
somewhere near the knee. He looked down and saw, to his very great
astonishment, Dobby the house-elf peering up at him from beneath his usual
eight hats.
“Hi, Dobby!” he said. “What are you — what’s wrong?”
For the elf’s eyes were wide with terror and he was shaking. The members
of the D.A. closest to Harry had fallen silent now: Everybody in the room was
watching Dobby. The few Patronuses people had managed to conjure faded
away into silver mist, leaving the room looking  ssor
Lupin turned up, carrying a large packing case, which he heaved onto
Professor Binns’s desk.
“What’s that?” said Harry.
“Another boggart,” said Lupin, stripping off his cloak. “I’ve been combing
the castle ever since Tuesday, and very luckily, I found this one lurking inside
Mr. Filch’s filing cabinet. It’s the nearest we’ll get to a real dementor. The
boggart will turn into a dementor when he sees you, so we’ll be able to
practice on him. I can store him in my office when we’re not using him;
there’s a cupboard under my desk he’ll like.”
“Okay,” said Harry, trying to sound as though he wasn’t apprehensive at all
and merely glad that Lupin had found such a good substitute for a real
dementor.
“So . . .” Professor Lupin had taken out his own wand, and indicated that
Harry should do the same. “The spell I am going to try and teach you is
highly advanced magic, Harry — well beyond Ordinary Wizarding Level. It
is called the Patronus Charm.”
“How does it work?” said Harry nervously.
“Well, when it works corre"
What form does Harry's Patronus take?,A stag,"According to the text, Harry's Patronus takes the form of a Hagrid-sized figure holding a large club, which is a unique projection of his happy memory.","ctly, it conjures up a Patronus,” said Lupin,
“which is a kind of anti-dementor — a guardian that acts as a shield between
you and the dementor.”
Harry had a sudden vision of himself crouching behind a Hagrid-sized
figure holding a large club. Professor Lupin continued, “The Patronus is a
kind of positive force, a projection of the very things that the dementor feeds
upon — hope, happiness, the desire to survive — but it cannot feel despair, as
real humans can, so the dementors can’t hurt it. But I must warn you, Harry,
that the charm might be too advanced for you. Many qualified wizards have

“What does a Patronus look like?” said Harry curiously.
“Each one is unique to the wizard who conjures it.”
“And how do you conjure it?”“With an incantation, which will work only if you are concentrating, with
all your might, on a single, very happy memory.”
Harry cast his mind about for a happy memory. Certainly, nothing that had
happened to him at the Dursleys’ was going to do. Finally, he settled   . . . one that he could
turn into a good, strong Patronus . . .
The moment when he’d first found out he was a wizard, and would be
leaving the Dursleys for Hogwarts! If that wasn’t a happy memory, he didn’t
know what was. . . . Concentrating very hard on how he had felt when he’d
realized he’d be leaving Privet Drive, Harry got to his feet and faced the
packing case once more.
“Ready?” said Lupin, who looked as though he were doing this against his
better judgment. “Concentrating hard? All right — go!”
He pulled off the lid of the case for the third time, and the dementor rose
out of it; the room fell cold and dark —
“EXPECTO PATRONUM!”
 Harry bellowed. 
“EXPECTO PATRONUM!
EXPECTO PATRONUM!”
The screaming inside Harry’s head had started again — except this time, it
sounded as though it were coming from a badly tuned radio — softer and
louder and softer again — and he could still see the dementor — it had halted
— and then a huge, silver shadow came bursting out of the end of Harry’s
wand, to hover between hi y something like a
dementor.
“Oh, don’t be such a killjoy,” said Cho brightly, watching her silvery swan-
shaped Patronus soar around the Room of Requirement during their last

“You’ve got to think of something happy,” Harry reminded him.
“I’m trying,” said Neville miserably, who was trying so hard his round face
was actually shining with sweat.
“Harry, I think I’m doing it!” yelled Seamus, who had been brought along
to his first e Dark Arts. Here, for the first time, Harry
felt sure he had passed. He had no problem with any of the written questions
and took particular pleasure, during the practical examination, in performing
all the counterjinxes and defensive spells right in front of Umbridge, who was
watching coolly from near the doors into the entrance hall.
“Oh bravo!” cried Professor Tofty, who was examining Harry again, whenHarry demonstrated a perfect boggart banishing spell. “Very good indeed!
Well, I think that’s all, Potter . . . unless . . .”
He leaned forward a little.
“I heard, from my dear friend Tiberius Ogden, that you can produce a
Patronus? For a bonus point . . . ?”
Harry raised his wand, looked directly at Umbridge, and imagined her
being sacked.
“Expecto Patronum!”
The silver stag erupted from the end of his wand and cantered the length of
the hall. All of the examiners looked around to watch its progress and when it
dissolved into silver mist, Professor Tofty clapped his veined and knotted
hands enthusiastically.
 single gold hoop in his
ear. “He looks exactly like James.”
“Except the eyes,” said a wheezy-voiced, silver-haired wizard at the back.
“Lily’s eyes.”
Mad-Eye Moody, who had long grizzled gray hair and a large chunk
missing from his nose, was squinting suspiciously at Harry through his
mismatched eyes. One of the eyes was small, dark, and beady, the other large,
round, and electric blue — the magical eye that could see through walls,
doors, and the back of Moody’s own head.
“Are you quite sure it’s him, Lupin?” he growled. “It’d be a nice lookout if
we bring back some Death Eater impersonating him. We ought to ask him
something only the real Potter would know. Unless anyone brought any
Veritaserum?”
“Harry, what form does your Patronus take?” said Lupin.
“A stag,” said Harry nervously.
“That’s him, Mad-Eye,” said Lupin.
Harry descended the stairs, very conscious of everybody still staring at him,stowing his wand into the back pocket of his jeans as he came.
“Don’t put your wand there, boy!” roared Moody. “What aid Harry angrily, “but I only used it because we were —”
The witch with the monocle on Fudge’s left cut across him in a booming
voice.
“You produced a fully fledged Patronus?”
“Yes,” said Harry, “because —”
“A corporeal Patronus?”
“A — what?” said Harry.“Your Patronus had a clearly defined form? I mean to say, it was more than
vapor or smoke?”
“Yes,” said Harry, feeling both impatient and slightly desperate, “it’s a stag,
it’s always a stag.”
“Always?” boomed Madam Bones. “You have produced a Patronus before
now?”
“Yes,”
 said Harry, “I’ve been doing it for over a year —”
“And you are fifteen years old?”
“Yes, and —”
“You learned this at school?”
“Yes, Professor Lupin taught me in my third year, because of the —”
“Impressive,” said Madam Bones, staring down at him, “a true Patronus at
that age . . . very impressive indeed.”
Some of the wizards and witches around her were muttering again; a few
nodded, but others were frowning and shaking their heads.
“It’s not a question of how impressive the magic was,” sai lf, guilty about his secret desire to
hear his parents’ voices again.
“You’re expecting too much of yourself,” said Professor Lupin sternly in
their fourth week of practice. “For a thirteen-year-old wizard, even an

never wanted him. Then he returned to the Gaunt hovel, performed the
complex bit of magic that would implant a false memory in his uncle’s mind,
laid Morfin’s wand beside its unconscious owner, pocketed the ancient ring he
wore, and departed.”
“And Morfin never realized he hadn’t done it?”
“Never,” said Dumbledore. “He gave, as I say, a full and boastful
confession.”
“But he had this real memory in him all the time!”
“Yes, but it took a great deal of skilled Legilimency to coax it out of him,”
said Dumbledore, “and why should anybody delve further into Morfin’s mind
when he had already confessed to the crime? However, I was able to secure a
visit to Morfin in the last weeks of his life, by which time I was attempting to
discover as much as I could about Voldemort’s past. I extracted this memory
with difficulty. When I saw what it contained, I attempted to use it to secure
Morfin’s release from Azkaban. Before the Ministry reached their decision,
however, Morfin had died.”
“But how come the Ministr over again, leaving the place where it had been slightly redder than before but
quite smooth.
Harry looked around at Umbridge. She was watching him, her wide,
toadlike mouth stretched in a smile.
“Yes?”
“Nothing,” said Harry quietly.
He looked back at the parchment, placed the quill upon it once more, wrote
I must not tell lies,
 and felt the searing pain on the back of his hand for a
second time; once again the words had been cut into his skin, once again they
healed over seconds later.
And on it went. Again and again Harry wrote the words on the parchment
in what he soon came to realize was not ink, but his own blood. And again
and again the words were cut into the back of his hand, healed, and then
reappeared the next time he set quill to parchment.
Darkness fell outside Umbridge’s window. Harry did not ask when he
would be allowed to stop. He did not even check his watch. He knew she was
watching him for signs of weakness and he was not going to show any, not
even if he had to sit here all night, cutting  sked shakily.
“This? It is called a Pensieve,” said Dumbledore. “I sometimes find, and I
am sure you know the feeling, that I simply have too many thoughts and
memories crammed into my mind.”
“Er,” said Harry, who couldn’t truthfully say that he had ever felt anything
of the sort.
“At these times,” said Dumbledore, indicating the stone basin, “I use the
Pensieve. One simply siphons the excess thoughts from one’s mind, pours
them into the basin, and examines them at one’s leisure. It becomes easier to
spot patterns and links, you understand, when they are in this form.”
“You mean . . . that stuff’s your 
thoughts
?” Harry said, staring at the
swirling white substance in the basin.
“Certainly,” said Dumbledore. “Let me show you.”
Dumbledore drew his wand out of the inside of his robes and placed the tip
into his own silvery hair, near his temple. When he took the wand away, hair
seemed to be clinging to it — but then Harry saw that it was in fact a
glistening strand of the same strange silvery-white substance t  give it to me.”
There was a little silence.
“I see,” said Dumbledore eventually, peering at Harry over the top of his
half-moon spectacles and giving Harry the usual sensation that he was being
X-rayed. “And you feel that you have exerted your very best efforts in this
matter, do you? That you have exercised all of your considerable ingenuity?
That you have left no depth of cunning unplumbed in your quest to retrieve
the memory?”
“Well,” Harry stalled, at a loss for what to say next. His single attempt to
get hold of the memory suddenly seemed embarrassingly feeble. “Well . . . the
day Ron swallowed love potion by mistake I took him to Professor Slughorn.
I thought maybe if I got Professor Slughorn in a good enough mood —”
“And did that work?” asked Dumbledore.
“Well, no, sir, because Ron got poisoned —”
“— which, naturally, made you forget all about trying to retrieve the
memory; I would have expected nothing else, while your best friend was in
danger. Once it became clear that Mr. Weasley was going to make , over the place where Dobby’s head now rested.
He then felt in his pocket for a wand.
There were two in there. He had forgotten, lost track; he could not now
remember whose wands these were; he seemed to remember wrenching them
out of someone’s hand. He selected the shorter of the two, which felt
friendlier in his hand, and pointed it at the rock.
Slowly, under his murmured instruction, deep cuts appeared upon the
rock’s surface. He knew that Hermione could have done it more neatly, and
probably more quickly, but he wanted to mark the spot as he had wanted to
dig the grave. When Harry stood up again, the stone read:
HERE LIES DOBBY, A FREE ELF.
He looked down at his handiwork for a few more seconds, then walkedaway, his scar still prickling a little, and his mind full of those things that had
come to him in the grave, ideas that had taken shape in the darkness, ideas
both fascinating and terrible.
They were all sitting in the living room when he entered the little hall, their
attention focused upon Bill, who ated his consciousness like a paralyzing dart.
He was expelled from Hogwarts. It was all over. He was never going back.
He looked up at the Dursleys. Uncle Vernon was purple-faced, shouting,
his fists still raised; Aunt Petunia had her arms around Dudley, who was
retching again.
Harry’s temporarily stupefied brain seemed to reawaken. 
Ministry
representatives will be calling at your place of residence shortly to destroy
your wand. 
There was only one thing for it. He would have to run — now.
Where he was going to go, Harry didn’t know, but he was certain of one
thing: At Hogwarts or outside it, he needed his wand. In an almost dreamlike
state, he pulled his wand out and turned to leave the kitchen.
“Where d’you think you’re going?” yelled Uncle Vernon. When Harry
didn’t reply, he pounded across the kitchen to block the doorway into the hall.
“I haven’t finished with you, boy!”
“Get out of the way,” said Harry quietly.
“You’re going to stay here and explain how my son —”
“If you don’t get out of the way I’m go  trying to remember how to kill it!” said Hermione.
“Well, hurry up, I can’t breathe!” Harry gasped, wrestling with it as it
curled around his chest.
“Devil’s Snare, Devil’s Snare . . . what did Professor Sprout say? — it likes
the dark and the damp —”
“So light a fire!” Harry choked.
“Yes — of course — but there’s no wood!” Hermione cried, wringing her
hands.
“HAVE YOU GONE MAD?” Ron bellowed. “ARE YOU A WITCH OR
NOT?”“Oh, right!” said Hermione, and she whipped out her wand, waved it,
muttered something, and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had used
on Snape at the plant. In a matter of seconds, the two boys felt it loosening its
grip as it cringed away from the light and warmth. Wriggling and flailing, it
unraveled itself from their bodies, and they were able to pull free.
“Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,” said Harry as he joined
her by the wall, wiping sweat off his face.
“Yeah,” said Ron, “and lucky Harry doesn’t lose his head in a crisis
—‘there’s no wood,’ 
honestly.
”
“This wa , from which Harry retrieved it with a Summoning Charm.
Glancing around he thought he had been right to suggest that they practice the
basics first; there was a lot of shoddy spellwork going on; many people were
not succeeding in disarming their opponents at all, but merely causing them to
jump backward a few paces or wince as the feeble spell whooshed over them.“Expelliarmus!” 
said Neville, and Harry, caught unawares, felt his wand
fly out of his hand.
“I DID IT!” said Neville gleefully. “I’ve never done it before — I DID IT!”
“Good one!” said Harry encouragingly, deciding not to point out that in a
real duel situation Neville’s opponent was unlikely to be staring in the
opposite direction with his wand held loosely at his side. “Listen, Neville, can
you take it in turns to practice with Ron and Hermione for a couple of minutes
so I can walk around and see how the rest are doing?”
Harry moved off into the middle of the room. Something very odd was
happening to Zacharias Smith; every time he opened his mouth"

“Oh hurry up,” Ron moaned, massaging his stomach.
“Now, Ron, the Sorting’s much more important than food,” said Nearly
Headless Nick as “Madley, Laura!” became a Hufflepuff.“’Course it is, if you’re dead,” snapped Ron.
“I do hope this year’s batch of Gryffindors are up to scratch,” said Nearly
Headless Nick, applauding as “McDonald, Natalie!” joined the Gryffindor
table. “We don’t want to break our winning streak, do we?”
Gryffindor had won the Inter-House Championship for the last three years
in a row.
“Pritchard, Graham!”
“SLYTHERIN!”
“Quirke, Orla!”
“RAVENCLAW!”
And finally, with “Whitby, Kevin!”(“HUFFLEPUFF!”), the Sorting ended.
Professor McGonagall picked up the hat and the stool and carried them away.
“About time,” said Ron, seizing his knife and fork and looking expectantly
at his golden plate.
Professor Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was smiling around at the
students, his arms opened wide in welcome.
“I have only two words to say to you,” he told them, his deep voice echoing
around the  rom a doorway to the right — the
rest of the school must already be here — but Professor McGonagall showed
the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in,
standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering
about nervously.
“Welcome to Hogwarts,” said Professor McGonagall. “The start-of-term
banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall,
you will be sorted into your Houses. The Sorting is a very importantceremony because, while you are here, your House will be something like
your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your
House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free time in your House

“The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and
Slytherin. Each House has its own noble history and each has produced
outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs
will earn your House points, while any rule-breaking will lose House points.
At the end of the cer in the Muggle world —
everyone follows Quidditch — played up in the air on broomsticks and
there’s four balls — sorta hard ter explain the rules.”
“And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?”
“School Houses. There’s four. Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o’
duffers, but —”
“I bet I’m in Hufflepuff,” said Harry gloomily.
“Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin,” said Hagrid darkly. “There’s not a
single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn’t in Slytherin. You-Know-
Who was one.”
“Vol-, sorry — You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?”
“Years an’ years ago,” said Hagrid.
They bought Harry’s school books in a shop called Flourish and Blotts
where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as paving
stones bound in leather; books the size of postage stamps in covers of silk;
books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with nothing in them at all.
Even Dudley, who never read anything, would have been wild to get his
hands on some of these. Hagrid almost had to drag Harry away from

CHAPTER  TWENTY-EIGHT
SNAPE’S WORST MEMORY
 
——— 
BY ORDER OF
 ———
The Ministry of Magic
 
Dolores Jane Umbridge (High Inquisitor) has replaced Albus
Dumbledore as Head of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
 
The above is in accordance with Educational Decree Number Twenty-
eight.
The notices had gone up all over the school overnight, but they did not
explain how every single person within the castle seemed to know that
Dumbledore had overcome two Aurors, the High Inquisitor, the Minister of
Magic, and his Junior Assistant to escape. No matter where Harry went withinthe castle next day, the sole topic of conversation was Dumbledore’s flight,
and though some of the details might have gone awry in the retelling (Harry
overheard one second-year girl assuring another that Fudge was now lying in
St. Mungo’s with a pumpkin for a head), it was surprising how accurate the
rest of their information was. Everybody seemed aware, for instance, that
Harry and Marietta were the only students to have w of a very fine person,
who should be sitting here,” he gestured toward the Hufflepuffs, “enjoying
our feast with us. I would like you all, please, to stand, and raise your glasses,
to Cedric Diggory.”
They did it, all of them; the benches scraped as everyone in the Hall stood,
and raised their goblets, and echoed, in one loud, low, rumbling voice,
“Cedric Diggory.”
Harry caught a glimpse of Cho through the crowd. There were tears
pouring silently down her face. He looked down at the table as they all sat
down again.
“Cedric was a person who exemplified many of the qualities that
distinguish Hufflepuff House,” Dumbledore continued. “He was a good and
loyal friend, a hard worker, he valued fair play. His death has affected you all,
whether you knew him well or not. I think that you have the right, therefore,
to know exactly how it came about.”Harry raised his head and stared at Dumbledore.
“Cedric Diggory was murdered by Lord Voldemort.”
A panicked whisper swept the Great Hall. People were staring at
Dumbledore  long line
of scared-looking first years filing into the Hall. Ginny was among them,
easily visible because of her vivid Weasley hair. Meanwhile, Professor
McGonagall, a bespectacled witch with her hair in a tight bun, was placing
the famous Hogwarts Sorting Hat on a stool before the newcomers.
Every year, this aged old hat, patched, frayed, and dirty, sorted new
students into the four Hogwarts Houses (Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw,
and Slytherin). Harry well remembered putting it on, exactly one year ago,and waiting, petrified, for its decision as it muttered aloud in his ear. For a
few horrible seconds he had feared that the hat was going to put him in
Slytherin, the House that had turned out more Dark witches and wizards than
any other — but he had ended up in Gryffindor, along with Ron, Hermione,
and the rest of the Weasleys. Last term, Harry and Ron had helped Gryffindor
win the House Championship, beating Slytherin for the first time in seven
years.
A very small, mousy-haired boy had been called for out this conversation, now raised puffy red eyes and croaked, “I
dunno, Professor . . . that’s fer the Heads of House an’ the headmistress ter
decide . . .”
“Professor Dumbledore always valued your views,” said Professor
McGonagall kindly, “and so do I.”
“Well, I’m stayin’,” said Hagrid, fat tears still leaking out of the corners of
his eyes and trickling down into his tangled beard. “It’s me home, it’s bin me
home since I was thirteen. An’ if there’s kids who wan’ me ter teach ’em, I’ll
do it. But . . . I dunno . . . Hogwarts without Dumbledore . . .” He gulped and
disappeared behind his handkerchief once more, and there was silence.
“Very well,” said Professor McGonagall, glancing out of the window at thegrounds, checking to see whether the Minister was yet approaching, “then I
must agree with Filius that the right thing to do is to consult the governors,
who will make the final decision.
“Now, as to getting students home . . . there is an argument for doing it
sooner rather than later. We could arrange for  the Slytherins. Then
the Hufflepuffs stood, and almost at the same moment, the Ravenclaws, all of
them with their backs to Harry, all of them looking toward Pansy instead, and
Harry, awestruck and overwhelmed, saw wands emerging everywhere, pulled
from beneath cloaks and from under sleeves.
“Thank you, Miss Parkinson,” said Professor McGonagall in a clipped
voice. “You will leave the Hall first with Mr. Filch. If the rest of your House
could follow.”
Harry heard the grinding of benches and then the sound of the Slytherins
trooping out on the other side of the Hall.
“Ravenclaws, follow on!” cried Professor McGonagall.
Slowly the four tables emptied. The Slytherin table was completely
deserted, but a number of older Ravenclaws remained seated while their
fellows filed out; even more Hufflepuffs stayed behind, and half of Gryffindor
remained in their seats, necessitating Professor McGonagall’s descent from
the teachers’ platform to chivvy the underage on their way.
“Absolutely not, Creevey, go! 
And
 you, Peake"
What creature is Buckbeak?,Hippogriff,Buckbeak is a hippogriff.,"y, Ron, and
Hermione whip around. Buckbeak the hippogriff was lying in the corner,
chomping on something that was oozing blood all over the floor.
“I couldn’ leave him tied up out there in the snow!” choked Hagrid. “All on
his own! At Christmas.”
Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another. They had never seen eye
to eye with Hagrid about what he called “interesting creatures” and other
people called “terrifying monsters.” On the other hand, there didn’t seem to
be any particular harm in Buckbeak. In fact, by Hagrid’s usual standards, he
was positively cute.
“You’ll have to put up a good strong defense, Hagrid,” said Hermione,
sitting down and laying a hand on Hagrid’s massive forearm. “I’m sure you
can prove Buckbeak is safe.”
“Won’t make no diff’rence!” sobbed Hagrid. “Them Disposal devils,
they’re all in Lucius Malfoy’s pocket! Scared o’ him! An’ if I lose the case,
Buckbeak —”
Hagrid drew his finger swiftly across his throat, then gave a great wail and
lurched forward, his face in his arms.
“What about h. Buckbeak broke into a grudging trot. They
had reached the trees. . . .
“Quick! Quick!” Hermione moaned, darting out from behind her tree,
seizing the rope too and adding her weight to make Buckbeak move faster.
Harry looked over his shoulder; they were now blocked from sight; they
couldn’t see Hagrid’s garden at all.
“Stop!” he whispered to Hermione. “They might hear us —”
Hagrid’s back door had opened with a bang. Harry, Hermione, and
Buckbeak stood quite still; even the hippogriff seemed to be listening intently.
Silence . . . then —
“Where is it?” said the reedy voice of the Committee member. “Where is
the beast?”
“It was tied here!” said the executioner furiously. “I saw it! Just here!”
“How extraordinary,” said Dumbledore. There was a note of amusement in
his voice.
“Beaky!” said Hagrid huskily.
There was a swishing noise, and the thud of an axe. The executioner
seemed to have swung it into the fence in anger. And then came the howling,
and this time they could hear Hagrid’s words through his sobs.“Go the top of Buckbeak’s wing and hoisted himself onto
its back. Buckbeak stood up. Harry wasn’t sure where to hold on; everything
in front of him was covered with feathers.
“Go on, then!” roared Hagrid, slapping the hippogriff’s hindquarters.
Without warning, twelve-foot wings flapped open on either side of Harry;
he just had time to seize the hippogriff around the neck before he was soaring
upward. It was nothing like a broomstick, and Harry knew which one he
preferred; the hippogriff’s wings beat uncomfortably on either side of him,
catching him under his legs and making him feel he was about to be thrown
off; the glossy feathers slipped under his fingers and he didn’t dare get a
stronger grip; instead of the smooth action of his Nimbus Two Thousand, he
now felt himself rocking backward and forward as the hindquarters of the
hippogriff rose and fell with its wings.
Buckbeak flew him once around the paddock and then headed back to the
ground; this was the bit Harry had been dreading; he leaned back as the
smoo s okay then, Hagrid!” said Ron, clapping Hagrid on the
shoulder. But Hagrid continued to sob, and waved one of his gigantic hands,
inviting Harry to read on.
However, we must register our concern about the hippogriff in
question. We have decided to uphold the official complaint of Mr. Lucius
Malfoy, and this matter will therefore be taken to the Committee for the
Disposal of Dangerous Creatures. The hearing will take place on April
20th, and we ask you to present yourself and your hippogriff at theCommittee’s offices in London on that date. In the meantime, the
hippogriff should be kept tethered and isolated.
Yours in fellowship . . .
There followed a list of the school governors.
“Oh,” said Ron. “But you said Buckbeak isn’t a bad hippogriff, Hagrid. I
bet he’ll get off —”
“Yeh don’ know them gargoyles at the Committee fer the Disposal o’
Dangerous Creatures!” choked Hagrid, wiping his eyes on his sleeve.
“They’ve got it in fer interestin’ creatures!”
A sudden sound from the corner of Hagrid’s cabin made Harr ust
then, they heard a burst of song. It was Hagrid, making his way up to the
castle, singing at the top of his voice, and weaving slightly as he walked. A
large bottle was swinging from his hands.
“See?”
 Hermione whispered. “
See what would have happened?
 We’ve got
to keep out of sight! 
No, Buckbeak!
”
The hippogriff was making frantic attempts to get to Hagrid again; Harry
seized his rope too, straining to hold Buckbeak back. They watched Hagrid
meander tipsily up to the castle. He was gone. Buckbeak stopped fighting to
get away. His head drooped sadly.
Barely two minutes later, the castle doors flew open yet again, and Snape
came charging out of them, running toward the Willow.
Harry’s fists clenched as they watched Snape skid to a halt next to the tree,
looking around. He grabbed the Cloak and held it up.
“Get your filthy hands off it,” Harry snarled under his breath.
“Shh!”
Snape seized the branch Lupin had used to freeze the tree, prodded the
knot, and vanished from view as he put on the Cloak.“So th ain and Harry read on: This
specimen was bred in the zoo. “Oh, I see — so you’ve never been to Brazil?”
As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of
them jump. “DUDLEY! MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS
SNAKE! YOU WON’T 
BELIEVE
 WHAT IT’S DOING!”
Dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could.
“Out of the way, you,” he said, punching Harry in the ribs. Caught by
surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What came next happened so
fast no one saw how it happened — one second, Piers and Dudley were
leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with howls of
horror.
Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor’s tank had
vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the
floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for
the exits.
As the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low, hissing
voice said, “Brazil, here I come. . . . Thanksss, amigo.”
The keeper of th ver you need leaves or wood
from a tree in which a bowtruckle lodges, it is wise to have a gift of wood lice
ready to distract or placate it. They may not look dangerous, but if angered
they will gouge out human eyes with their fingers, which, as you can see, are
very sharp and not at all desirable near the eyeballs. So if you’d like to gather
closer, take a few wood lice and a bowtruckle — I have enough here for one
between three — you can study them more closely. I want a sketch from each
of you with all body parts labeled by the end of the lesson.”
The class surged forward around the trestle table. Harry deliberately circled
around the back so that he ended up right next to Professor Grubbly-Plank.
“Where’s Hagrid?” he asked her, while everyone else was choosing
bowtruckles.
“Never you mind,” said Professor Grubbly-Plank repressively, which had
been her attitude last time Hagrid had failed to turn up for a class too.
Smirking all over his pointed face, Draco Malfoy leaned across Harry and
seized the larges ing flat on his back with his arms and legs in the
air, gave Harry one upside-down look of deepest loathing and, with another
loud crack, vanished.
“Good,” said Dumbledore. “There is also the matter of the hippogriff,
Buckbeak. Hagrid has been looking after him since Sirius died, but Buckbeak
is yours now, so if you would prefer to make different arrangements —”
“No,” said Harry at once, “he can stay with Hagrid. I think Buckbeak
would prefer that.”
“Hagrid will be delighted,” said Dumbledore, smiling. “He was thrilled to
see Buckbeak again. Incidentally, we have decided, in the interests of
Buckbeak’s safety, to rechristen him ‘Witherwings’ for the time being, though
I doubt that the Ministry would ever guess he is the hippogriff they once
sentenced to death. Now, Harry, is your trunk packed?”
“Erm . . .”
“Doubtful that I would turn up?” Dumbledore suggested shrewdly.
“I’ll just go and — er — finish off,” said Harry hastily, hurrying to pick up
his fallen telescope and trainers.
It took him a little over ten"
Who is the founder of Gryffindor House?,Godric Gryffindor,The founder of Gryffindor House is Godric Gryffindor.,"ewn,
There lived four wizards of renown,
Whose names are still well known:
Bold Gryffindor, from wild moor,
Fair Ravenclaw, from glen,
Sweet Hufflepuff, from valley broad,
Shrewd Slytherin, from fen.
They shared a wish, a hope, a dream,
They hatched a daring plan
To educate young sorcerers
Thus Hogwarts School began.Now each of these four founders
Formed their own House, for each
Did value different virtues
In the ones they had to teach.
By Gryffindor, the bravest were
Prized far beyond the rest;
For Ravenclaw, the cleverest
Would always be the best;
For Hufflepuff, hard workers were
Most worthy of admission;
And power-hungry Slytherin
Loved those of great ambition.
While still alive they did divide
Their favorites from the throng,
Yet how to pick the worthy ones
When they were dead and gone?
’Twas Gryffindor who found the way,
He whipped me off his head
The founders put some brains in me
So I could choose instead!
Now slip me snug about your ears,
I’ve never yet been wrong,
I’ll have a look inside your mind
 ofessor Binns slowly, “yes, one could argue that, I suppose.”
He peered at Hermione as though he had never seen a student properly before.
“However, the legend of which you speak is such a very 
sensational,
 even
ludicrous
 tale —”
But the whole class was now hanging on Professor Binns’s every word. He
looked dimly at them all, every face turned to his. Harry could tell he was
completely thrown by such an unusual show of interest.
“Oh, very well,” he said slowly. “Let me see . . . the Chamber of
Secrets . . .
“You all know, of course, that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years
ago — the precise date is uncertain — by the four greatest witches and
wizards of the age. The four school Houses are named after them: Godric
Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin.
They built this castle together, far from prying Muggle eyes, for it was an age
when magic was feared by common people, and witches and wizards suffered
much persecution.”
He paused, gazed blearily around the room, and c rom a doorway to the right — the
rest of the school must already be here — but Professor McGonagall showed
the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in,
standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering
about nervously.
“Welcome to Hogwarts,” said Professor McGonagall. “The start-of-term
banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall,
you will be sorted into your Houses. The Sorting is a very importantceremony because, while you are here, your House will be something like
your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your
House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free time in your House
common room.
“The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and
Slytherin. Each House has its own noble history and each has produced
outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs
will earn your House points, while any rule-breaking will lose House points.
At the end of the rotection. The villages of Tinworth in Cornwall, Upper Flagley
in Yorkshire, and Ottery St. Catchpole on the south coast of England were
notable homes to knots of Wizarding families who lived alongside tolerant
and sometimes Confunded Muggles. Most celebrated of these half-magical
dwelling places is, perhaps, Godric’s Hollow, the West Country village where
the great wizard Godric Gryffindor was born, and where Bowman Wright,
Wizarding smith, forged the first Golden Snitch. The graveyard is full of the
names of ancient magical families, and this accounts, no doubt, for the stories
of hauntings that have dogged the little church beside it for many centuries.’
“You and your parents aren’t mentioned,” Hermione said, closing the book,
“because Professor Bagshot doesn’t cover anything later than the end of the
nineteenth century. But you see? Godric’s Hollow, Godric Gryffindor,Gryffindor’s sword; don’t you think Dumbledore would have expected you to
make the connection?”
“Oh yeah . . .”
Harry did not want to admit  uced myself?
Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington at your service. Resident ghost of
Gryffindor Tower.”
“I know who you are!” said Ron suddenly. “My brothers told me about you
— you’re Nearly Headless Nick!”
“I would 
prefer
 you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy —” the ghost began
stiffly, but sandy-haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted.
“
Nearly
 Headless? How can you be 
nearly
 headless?”
Sir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little chat wasn’t going at
all the way he wanted.
“Like 
this,
” he said irritably. He seized his left ear and pulled. His whole
head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge.
Someone had obviously tried to behead him, but not done it properly.
Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces, Nearly Headless Nick
flipped his head back onto his neck, coughed, and said, “So — new
Gryffindors! I hope you’re going to help us win the House Championship this
year? Gryffindors have never gone so long without winning. Slytherins havegot the Cup six years s of old when I was new
And Hogwarts barely started
The founders of our noble school
Thought never to be parted:
United by a common goal,
They had the selfsame yearning,
To make the world’s best magic school
And pass along their learning.
“Together we will build and teach!”
The four good friends decided
And never did they dream that they
Might someday be divided,
For were there such friends anywhere
As Slytherin and Gryffindor?
Unless it was the second pair
Of Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw?
So how could it have gone so wrong?
How could such friendships fail?
Why, I was there and so can tell
The whole sad, sorry tale.
Said Slytherin, “We’ll teach just those
Whose ancestry is purest.”
Said Ravenclaw, “We’ll teach those whose
Intelligence is surest.”
Said Gryffindor, “We’ll teach all those
With brave deeds to their name.”
Said Hufflepuff, “I’ll teach the lot,
And treat them just the same.”These differences caused little strife
When first they came to light,
For each of the four founders had
A House in which they migh ontinued.
“For a few years, the founders worked in harmony together, seeking out
youngsters who showed signs of magic and bringing them to the castle to be
educated. But then disagreements sprang up between them. A rift began to
grow between Slytherin and the others. Slytherin wished to be more 
selective
about the students admitted to Hogwarts. He believed that magical learning
should be kept within all-magic families. He disliked taking students ofMuggle parentage, believing them to be untrustworthy. After a while, there
was a serious argument on the subject between Slytherin and Gryffindor, and
Slytherin left the school.”
Professor Binns paused again, pursing his lips, looking like a wrinkled old
tortoise.
“Reliable historical sources tell us this much,” he said. “But these honest
facts have been obscured by the fanciful legend of the Chamber of Secrets.
The story goes that Slytherin had built a hidden chamber in the castle, of
which the other founders knew nothing.
“Slytherin, according to the legend, sea or of their old dormitory, which now
had a sign on it saying

room, with its five four-posters hung with red velvet and its high, narrow
windows. Their trunks had been brought up for them and stood at the ends of
their beds.
Ron grinned guiltily at Harry.
“I know I shouldn’t’ve enjoyed that or anything, but —”
The dormitory door flew open and in came the other second year
Gryffindor boys, Seamus Finnigan, Dean Thomas, and Neville Longbottom.
“Unbelievable!”
 beamed Seamus.“Cool,” said Dean.
“Amazing,” said Neville, awestruck.
Harry couldn’t help it. He grinned, too.T

he next day, however, Harry barely grinned once. Things started to go
downhill from breakfast in the Great Hall. The four long House tables
were laden with tureens of porridge, plates of kippers, mountains of toast, and
dishes of eggs and bacon, beneath the enchanted ceiling (today, a dull, cloudy
gray). Harry and Ron sat down at the Gryffindor table next to Hermi"

toward the concealed entrance to the Room of Requirement. As they ran, they
met crowds of students, most wearing traveling cloaks over their pajamas,
being shepherded down to the Great Hall by teachers and prefects.
“That was Potter!”
“Harry Potter!”
“It was him, I swear, I just saw him!”
But Harry did not look back, and at last they reached the entrance to the
Room of Requirement. Harry leaned against the enchanted wall, which
opened to admit them, and he and Luna sped back down the steep staircase.
“Wh — ?”
As the room came into view, Harry slipped down a few stairs in shock. It
was packed, far more crowded than when he had last been in there. Kingsley
and Lupin were looking up at him, as were Oliver Wood, Katie Bell, Angelina
Johnson and Alicia Spinnet, Bill and Fleur, and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley.
“Harry, what’s happening?” said Lupin, meeting him at the foot of the
stairs.
“Voldemort’s on his way, they’re barricading the school — Snape’s run for
it — What are you doing here? How did you know?”
“We s rom a doorway to the right — the

At the end of the schools. He supposed, now that he saw representatives of so many
nationalities in the campsite, that he had been stupid never to realize that
Hogwarts couldn’t be the only one. He glanced at Hermione, who looked
utterly unsurprised by the information. No doubt she had run across the news
about other Wizarding schools in some book or other.
“You’ve been ages,” said George when they finally got back to the
Weasleys’ tents.
“Met a few people,” said Ron, setting the water down. “You not got that
fire started yet?”
“Dad’s having fun with the matches,” said Fred.Mr. Weasley was having no success at all in lighting the fire, but it wasn’t
for lack of trying. Splintered matches littered the ground around him, but he
looked as though he was having the time of his life.
“Oops!” he said as he managed to light a match and promptly dropped it in
surprise.
“Come here, Mr. Weasley,” said Hermione kindly, taking the box from him,
and showing him how to do it properly.
At last they got the fire lit, though it was at least ano 
“Watch it!” Hagrid roared, pulling Ron away from his precious pumpkins.
It was nearly lunchtime and as Harry had only had one bit of treacle toffeesince dawn, he was keen to go back to school to eat. They said good-bye to
Hagrid and walked back up to the castle, Ron hiccoughing occasionally, but
only bringing up two very small slugs.
They had barely set foot in the cool entrance hall when a voice rang out,
“There you are, Potter — Weasley.” Professor McGonagall was walking
toward them, looking stern. “You will both do your detentions this evening.”
“What’re we doing, Professor?” said Ron, nervously suppressing a burp.
“
You
 will be polishing the silver in the trophy room with Mr. Filch,” said
Professor McGonagall. “And no magic, Weasley — elbow grease.”
Ron gulped. Argus Filch, the caretaker, was loathed by every student in the
school.
“And you, Potter, will be helping Professor Lockhart answer his fan mail,”
said Professor McGonagall.
“Oh n — Professor, can’t I go and do the trophy room, too?” said Harry
d ofessor Binns slowly, “yes, one could argue that, I suppose.”
He peered at Hermione as though he had never seen a student properly before.

“And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor on the
right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very
painful death.”
Harry laughed, but he was one of the few who did.
“He’s not serious?” he muttered to Percy.
“Must be,” said Percy, frowning at Dumbledore. “It’s odd, because he
usually gives us a reason why we’re not allowed to go somewhere — the
forest’s full of dangerous beasts, everyone knows that. I do think he might
have told us prefects, at least.”
“And now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!” cried
Dumbledore. Harry noticed that the other teachers’ smiles had become rather
fixed.
Dumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he was trying to get a fly off
the end, and a long golden ribbon flew out of it, which rose high above the
tables and twisted itself, snakelike, into words.
“Everyone pick their favorite tune,” said Dumbledore, “and off we go!”
And the school bellowed:
“Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts,
Teach us  ke a canary-yellow circus tent.
“Still got yer letter, Harry?” he asked as he counted stitches.
Harry took the parchment envelope out of his pocket.
“Good,” said Hagrid. “There’s a list there of everything yeh need.”

and read:

occasionally poking one another in the back or eye by mistake.
Hermione’s name was called. Trembling, she left the chamber with
Anthony Goldstein, Gregory Goyle, and Daphne Greengrass. Students who
had already been tested did not return afterward, so Harry and Ron had no
idea how Hermione had done.
“She’ll be fine — remember she got a hundred and twelve percent on one
of our Charms tests?” said Ron.
Ten minutes later, Professor Flitwick called, “Parkinson, Pansy — Patil,
Padma — Patil, Parvati — Potter, Harry.”
“Good luck,” said Ron quietly. Harry walked into the Great Hall, clutching
his wand so tightly his hand shook.
“Professor Tofty is free, Potter,” squeaked Professor Flitwick, who was
standing just inside the door. He pointed Harry toward what looked like the
very oldest and baldest examiner, who was sitting behind a small table in a far
corner, a short distance from Professo"
