Who is Harry Potter's best friend?,Ron Weasley,"According to the text, Harry Potter's best friends are Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger.","ere you’re going, Potter!”
“Sorry, Professor —”
“I’ve just been looking for you in the Gryffindor common room. Well, here
it is, we’ve done everything we could think of, and there doesn’t seem to be
anything wrong with it at all. You’ve got a very good friend somewhere,Potter. . . .”
Harry’s jaw dropped. She was holding out his Firebolt, and it looked as
magnificent as ever.
“I can have it back?” Harry said weakly. “Seriously?”
“Seriously,” said Professor McGonagall, and she was actually smiling. “I
daresay or
companionship on his trip to Diagon Alley. He preferred to operate alone. The
adult Voldemort is the same. You will hear many of his Death Eaters claiming
that they are in his confidence, that they alone are close to him, even
understand him. They are deluded. Lord Voldemort has never had a friend,
nor do I believe that he has ever wanted one.
“And lastly — I hope you are not too sleepy to pay attention to this, Harry
— the young Tom Riddle liked to collect trophies. You saw the box of stolen
articles he py birthday to me . . .”
No cards, no presents, and he would be spending the evening pretending
not to exist. He gazed miserably into the hedge. He had never felt so lonely.
More than anything else at Hogwarts, more even than playing Quidditch,
Harry missed his best friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. They,
however, didn’t seem to be missing him at all. Neither of them had written to
him all summer, even though Ron had said he was going to ask Harry to come
and stay.
Countless times, Harry had been o n!
She’s still Ron’s sister.
I’m his best mate!
That’ll make it worse.
If I talked to him first —
He’d hit you.
What if I don’t care?
He’s your best mate!
Harry barely noticed that they were climbing through the portrait hole into
the sunny common room, and only vaguely registered the small group of
seventh years clustered together there, until Hermione cried, “Katie! You’re
back! Are you okay?”
Harry stared: It was indeed Katie Bell, looking completely healthy and
surrounded by her jubilant friends.
“I’m r  friend.
He’s a convicted murderer, but he’s broken out of Wizard prison and he’s on
the run. He likes to keep in touch with me, though . . . keep up with my
news . . . check if I’m happy. . . .”
And, grinning broadly at the look of horror on Uncle Vernon’s face, Harry
set off toward the station exit, Hedwig rattling along in front of him, for what
looked like a much better summer than the last.

Interior illus ugh Riddle was a friend he’d had when he was very small, and had half-
forgotten. But this was absurd. He’d never had friends before Hogwarts,
Dudley had made sure of that.
Nevertheless, Harry was determined to find out more about Riddle, so next
day at break, he headed for the trophy room to examine Riddle’s special
award, accompanied by an interested Hermione and a thoroughly
unconvinced Ron, who told them he’d seen enough of the trophy room to last
him a lifetime.
Riddle’s burnished gold shield was tucke say you remember him at Hogwarts, Rosmerta,” murmured Professor
McGonagall. “Do you remember who his best friend was?”
“Naturally,” said Madam Rosmerta, with a small laugh. “Never saw one
without the other, did you? The number of times I had them in here — ooh,
they used to make me laugh. Quite the double act, Sirius Black and James
Potter!”
Harry dropped his tankard with a loud clunk. Ron kicked him.
“Precisely,” said Professor McGonagall. “Black and Potter. Ringleaders of
their little gang. Both very brig ell, I would, but he’s always asleep when I go and see him!” said
Lavender fretfully.
“Is he?” said Harry, surprised, for he had found Ron perfectly alert every
time he had been up to the hospital wing, both highly interested in the news of
Dumbledore and Snape’s row and keen to abuse McLaggen as much as
possible.
“Is Hermione Granger still visiting him?” Lavender demanded suddenly.
“Yeah, I think so. Well, they’re friends, aren’t they?” said Harry
uncomfortably.
“Friends, don’t make me laugh,” said Lavende"
What house is Harry Potter sorted into?,Gryffindor,Harry Potter is sorted into Gryffindor House.," year, the House with the most points is awarded the House
Cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever House
becomes yours.
“The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest
of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can
while you are waiting.”
Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville’s cloak, which was fastened
under his left ear, and on Ron’s smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to
flatten his hair.
“I shall return when we are r  you are here, your House will be something like
your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your
House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free time in your House
common room.
“The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and
Slytherin. Each House has its own noble history and each has produced
outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs
will earn your House points, while any rule-breaking will lose House points.
At the end of the House you’ll be in?
I’ve been asking around, and I hope I’m in Gryffindor, it sounds by far the
best; I hear Dumbledore himself was in it, but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn’t
be too bad. . . . Anyway, we’d better go and look for Neville’s toad. You two
had better change, you know, I expect we’ll be there soon.”
And she left, taking the toadless boy with her.“Whatever House I’m in, I hope she’s not in it,” said Ron. He threw his
wand back into his trunk. “Stupid spell — George gave it to me, bet he knew
it was  e wizard with a shock of white hair, was carrying an ancient hat and a
four-legged stool out of the hall.
“Oh,” said Hermione softly, “we’ve missed the Sorting!”
New students at Hogwarts were sorted into Houses by trying on the Sorting
Hat, which shouted out the House they were best suited to (Gryffindor,
Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, or Slytherin). Professor McGonagall strode off toward
her empty seat at the staff table, and Harry and Hermione set off in the other
direction, as quietly as possible, toward the Gry rom a doorway to the right — the
rest of the school must already be here — but Professor McGonagall showed
the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in,
standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering
about nervously.
“Welcome to Hogwarts,” said Professor McGonagall. “The start-of-term
banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall,
you will be sorted into your Houses. The Sorting is a very importantceremony because, while was lying on its side as if Tonks had
just knocked it over again.
“I think somebody’s been in here,” Hermione whispered, pointing toward
it.
“That could’ve happened as the Order left,” Ron murmured back.
“So where are these jinxes they put up against Snape?” Harry asked.
“Maybe they’re only activated if he shows up?” suggested Ron.
Yet they remained close together on the doormat, backs against the door,
scared to move farther into the house.
“Well, we can’t stay here forever,” said Harry, and he took a step  had done at the top of the tower where Dumbledore
had died: of dirt, sweat, and blood.
“So you aren’t wanted, then, Vernon? Or are you on that list under a
different name? What House were you in at Hogwarts?”
“Slytherin,” said Harry automatically.
“Funny ’ow they all thinks we wants to ’ear that,” jeered Scabior out of the
shadows. “But none of ’em can tell us where the common room is.”
“It’s in the dungeons,” said Harry clearly. “You enter through the wall. It’sfull of skulls and stuff and it’s under the   finger, “you wouldn’t
want to be stuck inside this house without company.”
“He’ll have company!” said Hermione. “It’s headquarters to the Order of
the Phoenix, isn’t it? He just got his hopes up that Harry would be coming to
live here with him.”
“I don’t think that’s true,” said Harry, wringing out his cloth. “He wouldn’t
give me a straight answer when I asked him if I could.”
“He just didn’t want to get his own hopes up even more,” said Hermione
wisely. “And he probably felt a bit guilty himself, because "
What is the name of Harry Potter's owl?,Hedwig,"According to the context, Harry Potter's owl is named Hedwig.","rry Potter’s, incidentally, who fought the Death Eaters
alongside him at the Ministry in June and —”
But the rest of this story was obscured by the large birdcage standing on
top of it. Inside it was a magnificent snowy owl. Her amber eyes surveyed the
room imperiously, her head swiveling occasionally to gaze at her snoring
master. Once or twice she clicked her beak impatiently, but Harry was too
deeply asleep to hear her.
A large trunk stood in the very middle of the room. Its lid was open; it
looked expec eeching, hooting, and flapping their wings.
“Harry!” said Hermione breathlessly, plunging her hands into the feathery
mass and pulling out a screech owl bearing a long, cylindrical package. “I
think I know what this means — open this one first!”
Harry ripped off the brown packaging. Out rolled a tightly furled copy of
March’s edition of 
The Quibbler. 
He unrolled it to see his own face grinning
sheepishly at him from the front cover. In large red letters across his picture
were the words:
 
HARRY POTTER SP He
brought it carefully inside. The owl dropped its letter onto Harry’s seat and
began zooming around their compartment, apparently very pleased with itself
for accomplishing its task. Hedwig clicked her beak with a sort of dignified
disapproval. Crookshanks sat up in his seat, following the owl with his great
yellow eyes. Ron, noticing this, snatched the owl safely out of harm’s way.
Harry picked up the letter. It was addressed to him. He ripped open the
letter, and shouted, “It’s from Sirius!”
“What?” sai Hagrid, clapping a hand to his
forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse, and from yet another
pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl — a real, live, rather ruffled-
looking owl — a long quill, and a roll of parchment. With his tongue between
his teeth he scribbled a note that Harry could read upside down:
Dear Professor Dumbledore,
Given Harry his letter.
Taking him to buy his things tomorrow.
Weather’s horrible. Hope you’re well.
Hagrid
Hagrid rolled up the note, gave it to the owl, which nce: A
dazed and ruffled-looking barn owl was sitting outside on the kitchen sill,
having just collided with the closed window.
Ignoring Uncle Vernon’s anguished yell of “OWLS!” Harry crossed the
room at a run and wrenched the window open again. The owl stuck out its leg,
to which a small roll of parchment was tied, shook its feathers, and took off
the moment Harry had pulled off the letter. Hands shaking, Harry unfurled the
second message, which was written very hastily and blotchily in black ink.
Harry 
—  by the cluster of owls, all of
whom were jostling close to her, trying to deliver their own letter first.
“What on earth — ?” Hermione said, taking the letter from the gray owl,
opening it, and starting to read. “Oh really!” she sputtered, going rather red.
“What’s up?” said Ron.
“It’s — oh how ridiculous —”
She thrust the letter at Harry, who saw that it was not handwritten, but
composed from pasted letters that seemed to have been cut out of the 
Daily
Prophet.
You are a WickEd giRL. HarRy PotTER desErve er his shoulder. “What’s thatthing outside your window?”
Harry turned to look outside. Something very small and gray was bobbing
in and out of sight beyond the glass. He stood up for a better look and saw
that it was a tiny owl, carrying a letter that was much too big for it. The owl
was so small, in fact, that it kept tumbling over in the air, buffeted this way
and that in the train’s slipstream. Harry quickly pulled down the window,
stretched out his arm, and caught it. It felt like a very fluffy Snitch.  
“Whose owl am I going to use?” Harry said as they climbed the stairs. “Hetold me not to use Hedwig again.”
“Ask Ron if you can borrow —”
“I’m not asking Ron for anything,” Harry said flatly.
“Well, borrow one of the school owls, then, anyone can use them,” said
Hermione.
They went up to the Owlery. Hermione gave Harry a piece of parchment, a
quill, and a bottle of ink, then strolled around the long lines of perches,
looking at all the different owls, while Harry sat down against a wall and
wrote his letter"
Who is the headmaster of Hogwarts?,Albus Dumbledore,"According to the passage, the headmaster of Hogwarts is Albus Dumbledore.","red
parchment.
A large picture of a familiar, hook-nosed, black-haired man stared up at
them all, beneath a headline that read:
SEVERUS SNAPE CONFIRMED AS HOGWARTS HEADMASTER
“No!” said Ron and Hermione loudly.
Hermione was quickest; she snatched up the newspaper and began to read
the accompanying story out loud.
“‘Severus Snape, long-standing Potions master at Hogwarts School of
Witchcraft and Wizardry, was today appointed headmaster in the most
important of several staffing changes at the ancient school.   at Hogwarts,” said Harry. “I mean, there’s Dumbledore, for one
thing — you know who Dumbledore is, don’t you?”
Dobby bowed his head.
“Albus Dumbledore is the greatest headmaster Hogwarts has ever had.
Dobby knows it, sir. Dobby has heard Dumbledore’s powers rival those of
He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named at the height of his strength. But, sir” —
Dobby’s voice dropped to an urgent whisper — “there are powers
Dumbledore doesn’t . . . powers no decent wizard . . .”
And before Harry could stop him, Dobby bounded off  unfolded it, and read it, with Ron,
Seamus, Dean, and Neville looking over his shoulder. It was an article topped
with a picture of Hagrid looking extremely shifty.
DUMBLEDORE’S GIANT MISTAKE
Albus Dumbledore, eccentric headmaster of Hogwarts School of
Witchcraft and Wizardry, has never been afraid to make
controversial staff appointments, 
writes Rita Skeeter, Special
Correspondent.
 In September of this year, he hired Alastor “Mad-
Eye” Moody, the notoriously jinx-happy ex-Auror, to teach Defense
Against  eep-seated
confusion.
“He might even be pretending,” said one specialist. “This could
be a plea for attention.”
The 
Daily Prophet,
 however, has unearthed worrying facts about
Harry Potter that Albus Dumbledore, headmaster of Hogwarts, has
carefully concealed from the Wizarding public.
“Potter can speak Parseltongue,” reveals Draco Malfoy, a
Hogwarts fourth year. “There were a lot of attacks on students acouple of years ago, and most people thought Potter was behind
them after they saw him lose his temper  o effect
improvements at the Wizarding school. As recently as August 30th
Educational Decree Twenty-two was passed, to ensure that, in the event of the
current headmaster being unable to provide a candidate for a teaching post,
the Ministry should select an appropriate person.
“‘That’s how Dolores Umbridge came to be appointed to the teaching staff
at Hogwarts,’ said Weasley last night. ‘Dumbledore couldn’t find anyone, so
the Minister put in Umbridge and of course, she’s been an immediate success
—’”
“She’ he had just been appointed Head Boy. Harry didn’t realize what he was so
pleased about until the Potions lesson about two weeks after Dumbledore and
Hagrid had left, when, sitting right behind Malfoy, Harry overheard him
gloating to Crabbe and Goyle.
“I always thought Father might be the one who got rid of Dumbledore,” he
said, not troubling to keep his voice down. “I told you he thinks
Dumbledore’s the worst headmaster the school’s ever had. Maybe we’ll get a
decent headmaster now. Someone who won’t 
want
 werewolf Remus Lupin, half-giant Rubeus Hagrid, and delusional
ex-Auror ‘Mad-Eye’ Moody.
“Rumors abound, of course, that Albus Dumbledore, once Supreme
Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards and Chief Warlock
of the Wizengamot, is no longer up to the task of managing the prestigious
school of Hogwarts.
“‘I think the appointment of the Inquisitor is a first step toward ensuring
that Hogwarts has a headmaster in whom we can all repose confidence,’ said
a Ministry insider last night.
“Wizengamot  a
frog? I might get Agrippa — thanks —”
Harry turned over his card and read:

C
onsidered by many the greatest wizard of modern times,
Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the Dark wizard
Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of
dragon’s blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas
Flamel. Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and tenpin
bowling.Harry turned the card back over and saw, to his astonish"
What spell is used to disarm an opponent?,Expelliarmus,The spell used to disarm an opponent is Impedimenta.,"!”
 Harry yelled. The spell hit the skrewt’s armor again and
ricocheted off; Harry staggered back a few paces and fell over.
“IMPEDIMENTA!”
The skrewt was inches from him when it froze — he had managed to hit it
on its fleshy, shell-less underside. Panting, Harry pushed himself away from it
and ran, hard, in the opposite direction — the Impediment Curse was not
permanent; the skrewt would be regaining the use of its legs at any moment.
He took a left path and hit a dead end, a right, and hit another; forcin as a
dangerous enemy, another to speak of them, as Snape was doing, with aloving caress in his voice?
“Your defenses,” said Snape, a little louder, “must therefore be as flexible
and inventive as the arts you seek to undo. These pictures” — he indicated a
few of them as he swept past — “give a fair representation of what happens to
those who suffer, for instance, the Cruciatus Curse” — he waved a hand
toward a witch who was clearly shrieking in agony — “feel the Dementor’s
Kiss” — a wizard lying huddled and  to disarm
Anthony Goldstein, his own wand would fly out of his hand, yet Anthony did
not seem to be making a sound. Harry did not have to look far for the solution
of the mystery, however; Fred and George were several feet from Smith and
taking it in turns to point their wands at his back.
“Sorry, Harry,” said George hastily, when Harry caught his eye. “Couldn’t
resist . . .”
Harry walked around the other pairs, trying to correct those who were
doing the spell wrong. Ginny was teamed with Michael Corner; s rd her use once before.

The slowly revolving Pro behind him.
“. . . you are, I believe, complete novices in the use of nonverbal spells.
What is the advantage of a nonverbal spell?”
Hermione’s hand shot into the air. Snape took his time looking around at
everybody else, making sure he had no choice, before saying curtly, “Very
well — Miss Granger?”
“Your adversary has no warning about what kind of magic you’re about to
perform,” said Hermione, “which gives you a split-second advantage.”
“An answer copied almost word for word from 
The Standard Book of
Spe yes glinting through the darkness.
At these words Harry remembered, as though from a former life, the
dueling club at Hogwarts he had attended briefly two years ago. . . . All he
had learned there was the Disarming Spell,
 “Expelliarmus”
 . . . and what use
would it be to deprive Voldemort of his wand, even if he could, when he was
surrounded by Death Eaters, outnumbered by at least thirty to one? He had
never learned anything that could possibly fit him for this. He knew he was
facing the thing against whi ion, it isagainst nature.”
“But how do you do it?”
“By an act of evil — the supreme act of evil. By committing murder.
Killing rips the soul apart. The wizard intent upon creating a Horcrux would
use the damage to his advantage: He would encase the torn portion —”
“Encase? But how — ?”
“There is a spell, do not ask me, I don’t know!” said Slughorn, shaking his
head like an old elephant bothered by mosquitoes. “Do I look as though I
have tried it — do I look like a killer?”
“No, sir, of course not,” said Rid nd held at the ready.
“Stand up and take out your wand, Potter.”
Harry got to his feet feeling nervous. They faced each other with the desk
between them.
“You may use your wand to attempt to disarm me, or defend yourself inany other way you can think of,” said Snape.
“And what are you going to do?” Harry asked, eyeing Snape’s wand
apprehensively.
“I am about to attempt to break into your mind,” said Snape softly. “We are
going to see how well you resist. I have been told that you have already
shown aptitude"
Who teaches Potions at Hogwarts?,Severus Snape,Professor Snape teaches Potions at Hogwarts.," Potions class
was about as safe as poking a sleeping dragon in the eye.
Potions lessons took place in one of the large dungeons. Thursday
afternoon’s lesson proceeded in the usual way. Twenty cauldrons stood
steaming between the wooden desks, on which stood brass scales and jars of
ingredients. Snape prowled through the fumes, making waspish remarks about
the Gryffindors’ work while the Slytherins sniggered appreciatively. Draco
Malfoy, who was Snape’s favorite student, kept flicking puffer-fish eyes at
Ro ly were they studying as though they had exams every day, but the
lessons themselves had become more demanding than ever before. Harry
barely understood half of what Professor McGonagall said to them these days;
even Hermione had had to ask her to repeat instructions once or twice.
Incredibly, and to Hermione’s increasing resentment, Harry’s best subject had
suddenly become Potions, thanks to the Half-Blood Prince.
Nonverbal spells were now expected, not only in Defense Against the Dark
Arts, but in Charms  their level,” she said briskly to
Snape’s back. “Though I would question whether it is advisable to teach them
a potion like the Strengthening Solution. I think the Ministry would prefer it if
that was removed from the syllabus.”
Snape straightened up slowly and turned to look at her.
“Now . . . how long have you been teaching at Hogwarts?” she asked, her
quill poised over her clipboard.
“Fourteen years,” Snape replied. His expression was unfathomable. His
eyes on Snape, Harry added a few drops to his potio s lesson, he knew he’d been wrong.
Snape didn’t dislike Harry — he 
hated
 him.
Potions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons. It was colder here
than up in the main castle, and would have been quite creepy enough without
the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls.
Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and like
Flitwick, he paused at Harry’s name.
“Ah, yes,” he said softly, “Harry Potter. Our new — 
celebrity
.”
Draco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and ghorn showed
us in our first Potions lesson. . . . There aren’t a whole variety of students
standing guard for Malfoy . . . it’s just Crabbe and Goyle as usual. . . . Yeah, it
all fits!” said Harry, jumping up and starting to pace in front of the fire.
“They’re stupid enough to do what they’re told even if he won’t tell them
what he’s up to . . . but he doesn’t want them to be seen lurking around
outside the Room of Requirement, so he’s got them taking Polyjuice to make
them look like other people. . . . Th thing for a whole
year —”
“We can’t do much by ourselves,” said Ron in a defeated voice. “I mean,
all right, we can go and look jinxes up in the library and try and practice
them, I suppose —”
“No, I agree, we’ve gone past the stage where we can just learn things out
of books,” said Hermione. “We need a teacher, a proper one, who can show us
how to use the spells and correct us if we’re going wrong.”
“If you’re talking about Lupin . . .” Harry began.
“No, no, I’m not talking about Lupin,” said Hermione. “He yone finding out that Harry had spent most of the last two
years at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The most they could
do, however, was to lock away Harry’s spellbooks, wand, cauldron, and
broomstick at the start of the summer break, and forbid him to talk to the
neighbors.
This separation from his spellbooks had been a real problem for Harry,
because his teachers at Hogwarts had given him a lot of holiday work. One of
the essays, a particularly nasty one about shrinking potions, was for Harry’ ady had some,” said Harry. “Professor Lupin gave me some. He
gave it to all of us.”
“Did he, now?” said Madam Pomfrey approvingly. “So we’ve finally got a
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher who knows his remedies?”
“Are you sure you feel all right, Potter?” Professor McGonagall said
sharply.
“Yes,” 
said Harry.
“Very well. Kindly wait outside while I have a quick word with Miss
Granger about her course schedule, then we can go down to the feast
together.”
Harry went back into the corridor with Madam Pomf"
What is the name of the Weasley's house?,The Burrow,"The name of the Weasley's house is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. However, it is described as having a rickety staircase that zigzagged through the house to the upper stories.","?” asked Harry, who found Ron just as
interesting as Ron found him.
“Er — yes, I think so,” said Ron. “I think Mum’s got a second cousin
who’s an accountant, but we never talk about him.”
“So you must know loads of magic already.”The Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale boy
in Diagon Alley had talked about.
“I heard you went to live with Muggles,” said Ron. “What are they like?”
“Horrible — well, not all of them. My aunt and uncle and cousin are,
though. Wish I’d had three wiza em was
engraved with one of the Weasley family’s names. There were no numerals
around the face, but descriptions of where each family member might be.
“Home,” “school,” and “work” were there, but there was also “traveling,”
“lost,” “hospital,” “prison,” and, in the position where the number twelve
would be on a normal clock, “mortal peril.”
Eight of the hands were currently pointing to the “home” position, but Mr.
Weasley’s, which was the longest, was still pointing to “work.” Mrs. Weasleysighed.
“Your fath ning on. “Right.”
“Yeah, we’ll come too,” said George.
“You stay where you are!”
 snarled Mrs. Weasley.
Harry and Ron edged out of the kitchen, and they, Hermione, and Ginny set
off along the narrow hallway and up the rickety staircase that zigzagged
through the house to the upper stories.
“What are Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes?” Harry asked as they climbed.
Ron and Ginny both laughed, although Hermione didn’t.
“Mum found this stack of order forms when she was cleaning Fred and
George’s room,” said Ron quietly. nt with a wave of her wand: In the flash of light caused by Mrs.
Weasley’s charm, Harry caught a glimpse of what looked like the plan of a
building.
Mrs. Weasley had seen him looking. She snatched the plan off the table and
stuffed it into Bill’s heavily laden arms.
“This sort of thing ought to be cleared away promptly at the end of
meetings,” she snapped before sweeping off toward an ancient dresser from
which she started unloading dinner plates.
Bill took out his wand, muttered 
“Evanesco!”
 and the scrol  Weasley normally
occupied, leaving Harry, Ron, and Hermione to squeeze side by side onto the
sofa. Once they had done so, Scrimgeour spoke.
“I have some questions for the three of you, and I think it will be best if we
do it individually. If you two” — he pointed at Harry and Hermione — “can
wait upstairs, I will start with Ronald.”
“We’re not going anywhere,” said Harry, while Hermione nodded
vigorously. “You can speak to us together, or not at all.”
Scrimgeour gave Harry a cold, appraising look. Harry ha  front door slammed.
“He’s back!” said George. “Dad’s home!”
They hurried through the garden and back into the house.
Mr. Weasley was slumped in a kitchen chair with his glasses off and his
eyes closed. He was a thin man, going bald, but the little hair he had was as
red as any of his children’s. He was wearing long green robes, which were
dusty and travel-worn.
“What a night,” he mumbled, groping for the teapot as they all sat down
around him. “Nine raids. Nine! And old Mundungus Fletcher tried to put a
he pparently rooted to the floor. Hermione disengaged
herself gently from her mother to join the group.
“Good afternoon,” said Mr. Weasley pleasantly to Uncle Vernon, coming to
a halt right in front of him. “You might remember me, my name’s Arthur
Weasley.”
As Mr. Weasley had singlehandedly demolished most of the Dursleys’
living room two years previously, Harry would have been very surprised if
Uncle Vernon had forgotten him. Sure enough, Uncle Vernon turned a deeper
shade of puce and glared at Mr. Weasley, b eir mouths. “There
are dangers involved of which you can have no idea, any of you . . . I think
Molly’s right, Sirius. We’ve said enough.”
Sirius half-shrugged but did not argue. Mrs. Weasley beckoned imperiously
to her sons and Hermione. One by one they stood up and Harry, recognizing
defeat, followed suit.M

reached the first landing."

The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.
Harry read the words slowly, as though he would have only one chance to
take in their meaning, and he read the last of them aloud.
“‘The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death’ . . .” A horrible thought
came to him, and wit . Again, your readers will have to buy my book for the
whole story, but there is no question that Dumbledore took an unnatural
interest in Potter from the word go. Whether that was really in the boy’s
best interests — well, we’ll see. It’s certainly an open secret that Potter
has had a most troubled adolescence.”
I ask whether Skeeter is still in touch with Harry Potter, whom she so
famously interviewed last year: a breakthrough piece in which Potter
spoke exclusively of his conviction that You-Know-Who had hose friends of Harry Potter’s who are
suffering for their allegiance?” Lee was saying.
“Well, as regular listeners will know, several of the more outspoken
supporters of Harry Potter have now been imprisoned, including Xenophilius
Lovegood, erstwhile editor of

“At least he’s still alive!” muttered Ron.

three of them gasped, and so nearly missed the rest of the sentence — “well-

DUMBLEDORE’S GIANT MISTAKE
Albus Dumbledore, eccentric headmaster of Hogwarts School of
Witchcraft and Wizardry, has never been afraid to make
controversial staff appointments, 
writes Rita Skeeter, Special
Correspondent.
 In September of this year, he hired Alastor “Mad-
Eye” Moody, the notoriously jinx-happy ex-Auror, to teach Defense
Against  said Ron, but Hermione told him to be quiet until she’d looked
something up, and started flicking frantically through the pages, muttering to
herself.
At last she found what she was looking for.
“I knew it! I 
knew
 it!”
“Are we allowed to speak yet?” said Ron grumpily. Hermione ignored him.
“Nicolas Flamel,” she whispered dramatically, “is the 
only known maker of
the Sorcerer’s Stone
!”
This didn’t have quite the effect she’d expected.

pulled out the first page of parchment within, and read:
Dear Mr. Potter,
Please note that the new school year will begin on September the first.
The Hogwarts Express will leave from King’s Cross station, platform
nine and three-quarters, at eleven o’clock.
Third years are permitted to visit the village of Hogsmeade on certain
weekends. Please give the enclosed permission form to your parent or
guardian to sign.A list of books for next ye and all too soon, the Hogwarts
Express was pulling in at platform nine and three-quarters. The usual
confusion and noise filled the corridors as the students began to disembark.Ron and Hermione struggled out past Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, carrying
their trunks. Harry, however, stayed put.
“Fred — George — wait a moment.”
The twins turned. Harry pulled open his trunk and drew out his Triwizard
winnings.
“Take it,” he said, and he thrust the sack into George’s hands.
“What?” said Fred, looking flabbergasted.  ten. The only tricky part was doing this in an
unobtrusive way, so as to avoid attracting Muggle attention. They did it in
groups today; Harry, Ron, and Hermione (the most conspicuous, since they
were accompanied by Pigwidgeon and Crookshanks) went first; they leaned
casually against the barrier, chatting unconcernedly, and slid sideways
through it . . . and as they did so, platform nine and three-quarters
materialized in front of them.
The Hogwarts Express, a gleaming scarlet steam engine, was already the ough onto
platform nine and three quarters, where the Hogwarts Express stood belching
sooty steam over a platform packed with departing students and their families.Harry inhaled the familiar smell and felt his spirits soar. . . . He was really
going back. . . .
“I hope the others make it in time,” said Mrs. Weasley anxiously, staring
behind her at the wrought-iron arch spanning the platform, through which
new arrivals would come.
“Nice dog, Harry!” called a tall boy with dreadlocks.
“Thanks, Lee,” said Harr eks beforehand. A limited number use Muggle
transport, but we can’t have too many clogging up their buses and trains —
remember, wizards are coming from all over the world. Some Apparate, of
course, but we have to set up safe points for them to appear, well away from
Muggles. I believe there’s a handy wood they’re using as the Apparition
point. For those who don’t want to Apparate, or can’t, we use Portkeys.
They’re objects that are used to transport wizards from one spot to another at
a prearranged time. Y agical Games and Sports.
I do hope you will allow us to take Harry to the match, as this
really is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity; Britain hasn’t hosted the
Cup for thirty years, and tickets are extremely hard to come by. We
would of course be glad to have Harry stay for the remainder of the
summer holidays, and to see him safely onto the train back to
school.
It would be best for Harry to send us your answer as quickly as
possible in the normal way, because the Muggle postman has never

“Don’ you worry, Harry. You’ll learn fast enough. Everyone starts at the

Yeh’ve been singled out, an’ that’s always hard. But yeh’ll have a great time
at Hogwarts — I did — still do, ’smatter of fact.”
Hagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take him back to the
Dursleys, then handed him an envelope.

spluttered. “I got famous because he murdered my family but couldn’t kill

following Dudley’s diet, and he wasn’t going to let Uncle Vernon stop him
from going to the Quidditch World Cup, not if he could help it. Harry took a
deep, steadying breath and then said, “Okay, I can’t see the World Cup. Can I
go now, then? Only I’ve got a letter to Sirius I want to finish. You know —
my godfather.”
He had done it. He had said the magic words. Now he watched the purple
recede blotchily from Uncle Vernon’s face, making it look   Harry bid him
and Hermione good-bye, then wheeled the trolley bearing his trunk and
Hedwig’s cage toward Uncle Vernon, who greeted him in his usual fashion.
“What’s that?” he snarled, staring at the envelope Harry was still clutching
in his hand. “If it’s another form for me to sign, you’ve got another —”
“It’s not,” said Harry cheerfully. “It’s a letter from my godfather.”
“Godfather?” spluttered Uncle Vernon. “You haven’t got a godfather!”
“Yes, I have,” said Harry brightly. “He was my mum and dad’s best ’s boss!” Ron breathed. “Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of
Magic!”
Harry elbowed Ron hard to make him shut up.
Hagrid had gone pale and sweaty. He dropped into one of his chairs and
looked from Dumbledore to Cornelius Fudge.“Bad business, Hagrid,” said Fudge in rather clipped tones. “Very bad
business. Had to come. Four attacks on Muggle-borns. Things’ve gone far
enough. Ministry’s got to act.”
“I never,” said Hagrid, looking imploringly at Dumbledore. “You know I

and started turning the pages, searching, until . . .
He stopped on a picture of his parents’ wedding day. There was his father
waving up at him, beaming, the untidy black hair Harry had inheritedstanding up in all directions. There was his mother, alight with happiness, arm
in arm with his dad. And there . . . that must be him. Their best man . . . Harry
had never given him a thought before.
If he hadn’t known themselves in after them; Harry took one glance back at the
thestrals, now foraging for scraps of rotten food inside the dumpster, then
forced himself into the box after Luna.
“Whoever’s nearest the receiver, dial six two four four two!” he said.
Ron did it, his arm bent bizarrely to reach the dial. As it whirred back into
place the cool female voice sounded inside the box, “Welcome to the Ministry
of Magic. Please state your name and business.”
“Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger,” Harry said very o his plate and splashing it everywhere in his anger. “Sort of
thing she’d do, isn’t it, hide in bushes listening to people.”
“Like you and Ron did, you mean,” said Hermione.
“We weren’t trying to hear him!” said Ron indignantly. “We didn’t have
any choice! The stupid prat, talking about his giantess mother where anyone
could have heard him!”
“We’ve got to go and see him,” said Harry. “This evening, after Divination.

leapt. There were no Aurors waiting outside the inn, but instead the gigantic,
black-bearded form of Rubeus Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper, wearing a
long beaverskin coat, beaming at the sight of Harry’s face and oblivious to the
startled stares of passing Muggles.“Harry!” he boomed, sweeping Harry into a bone-crushing hug the moment
Harry had stepped out of the car. “Buckbeak — Witherwings, I mean — yeh
should see him, Harry, he’s so happy ter be back in the open air —”
“Glad he’s pleased,” said Harr ists.) Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper, had
obliged with a sack full of his own homemade rock cakes. (Harry hadn’t
touched these; he had had too much experience of Hagrid’s cooking.) Mrs.
Weasley, however, had sent the family owl, Errol, with an enormous fruitcake
and assorted meat pies. Poor Errol, who was elderly and feeble, had needed a
full five days to recover from the journey. And then on Harry’s birthday(which the Dursleys had completely ignored) he had received four superb
birthday cakes, one each f im ’ere on the
Knight Bus, di’n’t we, Ern? ’E was tryin’ to run for it. . . .”
He, Harry, had broken Wizard law just like Sirius Black. Was inflating
Aunt Marge bad enough to land him in Azkaban? Harry didn’t know anything
about the wizard prison, though everyone he’d ever heard speak of it did so in
the same fearful tone. Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper, had spent two
months there only last year. Harry wouldn’t soon forget the look of terror on
Hagrid’s face when he had been told where he was going, and Ha w. Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two
large ice creams to show he couldn’t come in.
“That’s Hagrid,” said Harry, pleased to know something the boy didn’t.
“He works at Hogwarts.”
“Oh,” said the boy, “I’ve heard of him. He’s a sort of servant, isn’t he?”
“He’s the gamekeeper,” said Harry. He was liking the boy less and less
every second.
“Yes, exactly. I heard he’s a sort of 
savage

grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic,  d in front of him, holding a tray of what looked horribly
like whole human fingernails. She leered at him, showing mossy teeth. Harry
backed away.“I’m fine, thanks,” he said. “I’m just —”
“HARRY! What d’yeh think yer doin’ down there?”
Harry’s heart leapt. So did the witch; a load of fingernails cascaded down
over her feet and she cursed as the massive form of Hagrid, the Hogwarts
gamekeeper, came striding toward them, beetle-black eyes flashing over his
great bristling beard.
“Hagrid!” Harry croaked in rel s. One of Harry’s most prized
possessions was his Nimbus Two Thousand racing broom.
Harry put the leather case aside and picked up his last parcel. He
recognized the untidy scrawl on the brown paper at once: This was from
Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper. He tore off the top layer of paper and
glimpsed something green and leathery, but before he could unwrap it
properly, the parcel gave a strange quiver, and whatever was inside it snapped
loudly — as though it had jaws.
Harry froze. He knew that Hagrid would 
or catch the Snitch, a few goals and they would be in the lead as usual, Harry
assured himself, bobbing and weaving through the other players in pursuit of
something shiny that turned out to be Montague’s watch strap. . . .
But Ron let in two more goals. There was an edge of panic in Harry’s
desire to find the Snitch now. If he could just get it soon and finish the game
quickly . . .

there were no bent twigs to clip, and the handle was so shiny already it
seemed pointless to polish it. He and Ron simply sat admiring it from every
angle until the portrait hole opened, and Hermione came in, accompanied by
Professor McGonagall.
Though Professor McGonagall was head of Gryffindor House, Harry had
seen her in the"

“Yeah, that’s right,” said Ron in a heartened tone. “And we 
have 
got plenty
of time to do it all . . .”
Harry glanced over to his right as they approached the Quidditch pitch, to
where the trees of the Forbidden Forest were swaying darkly. Nothing flew
out of them; the sky was empty but for a few distant owls fluttering around
the Owlery Tower. He had enough to worry about; the flying horse wasn’t
doing him any harm: He pushed it out of his mind.
They collected balls from t  distant chair. A closer look
showed him that it was Cormac McLaggen.
“I’ve been waiting for you to come back,” said McLaggen, disregarding
Harry’s drawn wand. “Must’ve fallen asleep. Look, I saw them taking
Weasley up to the hospital wing earlier. Didn’t look like he’ll be fit for next
week’s match.”
It took Harry a few moments to realize what McLaggen was talking about.
“Oh . . . right . . . Quidditch,” he said, putting his wand back into the belt of
his jeans and running a hand wearily through his hair.  , but he had another reason for not
wanting Snape near him while he was playing Quidditch. . . .
The rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of
practice, but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common room,
where he found Ron and Hermione playing chess. Chess was the only thing
Hermione ever lost at, something Harry and Ron thought was very good for
her.
“Don’t talk to me for a moment,” said Ron when Harry sat down next to
him, “I need to concen —” He caught sight of H in

Crabbe and Goyle seemed to exist to do Malfoy’s bidding. They were both
wide and musclely; Crabbe was taller, with a pudding-bowl haircut and a very
thick neck; Goyle had short, bristly hair and long, gorilla-ish arms.
“Well, look who it is,” said Malfoy in his usual lazy drawl, pulling open the
compartment door. “Potty and the Weasel.”
Crabbe and Goyle chuckled trollishly.
“I heard your father finally got his hands on some gold  h. In the
end, he chose the same new subjects as Ron, feeling that if he was lousy at
them, at least he’d have someone friendly to help him.Gryffindor’s next Quidditch match would be against Hufflepuff. Wood was
insisting on team practices every night after dinner, so that Harry barely had
time for anything but Quidditch and homework. However, the training
sessions were getting better, or at least drier, and the evening before
Saturday’s match he went up to his dormitory to drop off his broomstick
feeling G he damage, but Harry swore to himself not to
meddle in things that weren’t his business from now on. He’d had it with
sneaking around and spying. He felt so ashamed of himself that he went to
Wood and offered to resign from the Quidditch team.
“Resign?”
 Wood thundered. “What good’ll that do? How are we going toget any points back if we can’t win at Quidditch?”
But even Quidditch had lost its fun. The rest of the team wouldn’t speak to
Harry during practice, and if they had to speak about him, they called h  He guards the goalposts. That’s
it, really.”
But Colin didn’t stop questioning Harry all the way down the sloping lawns
to the Quidditch field, and Harry only shook him off when he reached the
changing rooms; Colin called after him in a piping voice, “I’ll go and get a
good seat, Harry!” and hurried off to the stands.
The rest of the Gryffindor team were already in the changing room. Wood
was the only person who looked truly awake. Fred and George Weasley were
sitting, puffy-eyed and tousle-haired, next to House was obsessed with the coming match.
Gryffindor hadn’t won the Quidditch Cup since the legendary Charlie
Weasley (Ron’s second oldest brother) had been Seeker. But Harry doubted
whether any of them, even Wood, wanted to win as much as he did. The
enmity between Harry and Malfoy was at its highest point ever. Malfoy was
still smarting about the mud-throwing incident in Hogsmeade and was even
more furious that Harry had somehow wormed his way out of punishment.
Harry hadn’t forgotten Malfoy’s attempt to "
Who is the ghost of Gryffindor House?,Nearly Headless Nick,"The ghost of Gryffindor House is Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, also known as Nearly Headless Nick.","k, the Gryffindor
House ghost, and Parvati Patil and Lavender Brown, the last two of whom
gave Harry airy, overly friendly greetings that made him quite sure they had
stopped talking about him a split second before. He had more important
things to worry about, however: He was looking over the students’ heads to
the staff table that ran along the top wall of the Hall.
“He’s not there.”
Ron and Hermione scanned the staff table too, though there was no real
need; Hagrid’s size made him instantly obvious in any ching the
bottom of the stairs, where Nearly Headless Nick, ghost of Gryffindor Tower,
stood waiting for him.
“Harry! My dear boy!”Nick made to grasp Harry’s hands with both of his own: Harry’s felt as
though they had been thrust into icy water.
“Nick, you’ve got to help me. Who’s the ghost of Ravenclaw Tower?”
Nearly Headless Nick looked surprised and a little offended.
“The Gray Lady, of course; but if it is ghostly services you require — ?”
“It’s got to be her — d’you know where she is?”
“Let’s see. . .  oating over the tables in midair. The four long House
tables were packed with chattering students; at the top of the Hall, the staff sat
along one side of a fifth table, facing their pupils. It was much warmer in
here. Harry, Ron, and Hermione walked past the Slytherins, the Ravenclaws,
and the Hufflepuffs, and sat down with the rest of the Gryffindors at the farside of the Hall, next to Nearly Headless Nick, the Gryffindor ghost. Pearly
white and semitransparent, Nick was dressed tonight in his usual doubl uced myself?
Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington at your service. Resident ghost of
Gryffindor Tower.”
“I know who you are!” said Ron suddenly. “My brothers told me about you
— you’re Nearly Headless Nick!”
“I would 
prefer
 you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy —” the ghost began
stiffly, but sandy-haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted.
“
Nearly
 Headless? How can you be 
nearly
 headless?”
Sir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little chat wasn’t going at
all the way he wanted.
“Like 
this,
” he said  ing animatedly to tiny little Professor Flitwick, the
Charms teacher. Harry moved his eyes along the table, to the place where
Snape sat. Was he imagining it, or were Snape’s eyes flickering toward Lupin
more often than was natural?
The feast finished with an entertainment provided by the Hogwarts ghosts.
They popped out of the walls and tables to do a bit of formation gliding;
Nearly Headless Nick, the Gryffindor ghost, had a great success with a
reenactment of his own botched beheading.
It had been such a  withconcentration as he took aim again.
“PEEVES!” yelled an angry voice. “Peeves, come down here at ONCE!”
Professor McGonagall, deputy headmistress and Head of Gryffindor
House, had come dashing out of the Great Hall; she skidded on the wet floor
and grabbed Hermione around the neck to stop herself from falling.
“Ouch — sorry, Miss Granger —”
“That’s all right, Professor!” Hermione gasped, massaging her throat.
“Peeves, get down here NOW!” barked Professor McGonagall,
straightening her pointed hat and gla rry recognized him at once from the card he’d gotten out of
the Chocolate Frog on the train. Dumbledore’s silver hair was the only thing
in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts. Harry spotted Professor
Quirrell, too, the nervous young man from the Leaky Cauldron. He was
looking very peculiar in a large purple turban.
And now there were only four people left to be sorted. “Thomas, Dean,” a
black boy even taller than Ron, joined Harry at the Gryffindor table. “Turpin,
Lisa,” became a Ravenclaw  ently, when Nick continued to say nothing.
Nearly Headless Nick hesitated, then said, “Not everyone can come back as
a ghost.”
“What d’you mean?” said Harry quickly.
“Only . . . only wizards.”
“Oh,” said Harry, and he almost laughed with relief. “Well, that’s okaythen, the person I’m asking about is a wizard. So he can come back, right?”
Nick turned away from the window and looked mournfully at Harry. “He
won’t come back.”
“Who?”
“Sirius Black,” said Nick.
“But you did!” said Harry angrily. “You came back —"

“C’mon, let’s go. If we hurry we’ll be able to follow the Hogwarts Express

And they marched off through the crowd of curious Muggles, out of the
station and back onto the side road where the old Ford Anglia was parked.
Ron unlocked the cavernous trunk with a series of taps from his wand.
They heaved their luggage back in, put Hedwig on the back seat, and got into
the front.
“Check that no one’s watching,” said Ron, starting the ignition with another

discernible only when they moved, shimmering insubstantially on the
gleaming air.Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny filed into seats at the end of a row beside
the lake. People were whispering to each other; it sounded like a breeze in the
grass, but the birdsong was louder by far. The crowd continued to swell; with

him.
“Parked all right, then?” Ron asked Harry. “I did. Hermione didn’t believe I
could pass a Muggle driving test, did you? She thought I’d have to Confund

“No, I didn’t,” said Hermione, “I had complete faith in you.”
“As a matter of fact, I

together they lifted Albus’s trunk and owl onto the train.  es
over Pigwidgeon as they left the train, heads bent and eyes narrowed against
the downpour. The rain was now coming down so thick and fast that it was as
though buckets of ice-cold water were being emptied repeatedly over their
heads.

platform.
“All righ’, Harry?” Hagrid bellowed back, waving. “See yeh at the feast if

The weather could not have been more different on the journey back to King’s

There wasn’t a single cloud in the sky. Harry, Ron, and Hermione had
managed to get a compartment to themselves. Pigwidgeon was once again

What is the name of the house elf who serves the Malfoy family?,Dobby,The house-elf who serves the Malfoy family is Kreacher.," Malfoy made Dudley Dursley look like a kind,
thoughtful, and sensitive boy.
“I don’t know whether the Malfoys own a house-elf. . . .” said Harry.
“Well, whoever owns him will be an old Wizarding family, and they’ll be
rich,” said Fred.
“Yeah, Mum’s always wishing we had a house-elf to do the ironing,” said
George. “But all we’ve got is a lousy old ghoul in the attic and gnomes all
over the garden. House-elves come with big old manors and castles and
places like that; you wouldn’t catch one in our house. .   wearily to Harry. “I’m no
great shakes at languages; I need Barty Crouch for this sort of thing. Ah, I see
his house-elf’s saving him a seat. . . . Good job too, these Bulgarian blighters
have been trying to cadge all the best places . . . ah, and here’s Lucius!”
Harry, Ron, and Hermione turned quickly. Edging along the second row to
three still-empty seats right behind Mr. Weasley were none other than Dobby
the house-elf’s former owners: Lucius Malfoy; his son, Draco; and a woman
Harry supposed must be Dr r
to a house-elf!”
“Yeah, we don’t need to hear about you being in love with Malfoy,” Harry
told Kreacher. “Let’s fast forward to where he’s actually been going.”
Kreacher bowed again, looking furious, and then said, “Master Malfoy eats
in the Great Hall, he sleeps in a dormitory in the dungeons, he attends his
classes in a variety of —”
“Dobby, you tell me,” said Harry, cutting across Kreacher. “Has he been
going anywhere he shouldn’t have?”
“Harry Potter, sir,” squeaked Dobby, his great orblike eyes shini  Winky the house-elf
was fighting her way out of a clump of bushes nearby. She was moving in a
most peculiar fashion, apparently with great difficulty; it was as though
someone invisible were trying to hold her back.
“There is bad wizards about!” she squeaked distractedly as she leaned
forward and labored to keep running. “People high — high in the air! Winky
is getting out of the way!”
And she disappeared into the trees on the other side of the path, panting and
squeaking as she fought the force that was r he other hand, I would
advise you, Lucius, not to go giving out any more of Lord Voldemort’s old
school things. If any more of them find their way into innocent hands, I think
Arthur Weasley, for one, will make sure they are traced back to you. . . .”
Lucius Malfoy stood for a moment, and Harry distinctly saw his right hand
twitch as though he was longing to reach for his wand. Instead, he turned to
his house-elf.
“We’re going, Dobby!”
He wrenched open the door and as the elf came hurrying up to him, he
kic  clothes!”
Harry knew that the only way to turn a house-elf free was to present it with
proper garments. It was pitiful to see the way Winky clutched at her tea towelas she sobbed over Mr. Crouch’s feet.
“But she was frightened!” Hermione burst out angrily, glaring at Mr.
Crouch. “Your elf’s scared of heights, and those wizards in masks were
levitating people! You can’t blame her for wanting to get out of their way!”
Mr. Crouch took a step backward, freeing himself from contact with the elf,
whom he was sur imly, looking down at Winky’s
unconscious form. “Barty Crouch’s house-elf . . . I mean to say . . .”“Come off it, Amos,” said Mr. Weasley quietly, “you don’t seriously think
it was the elf? The Dark Mark’s a wizard’s sign. It requires a wand.”
“Yeah,” said Mr. Diggory, “and she 
had
 a wand.”
“What?”
 said Mr. Weasley.
“Here, look.” Mr. Diggory held up a wand and showed it to Mr. Weasley.
“Had it in her hand. So that’s clause three of the Code of Wand Use broken,
for a start. 
No non-human creature is permi use-elf,” said the creature.
“Oh — really?” said Harry. “Er — I don’t want to be rude or anything, but
— this isn’t a great time for me to have a house-elf in my bedroom.”
Aunt Petunia’s high, false laugh sounded from the living room. The elf
hung his head.
“Not that I’m not pleased to meet you,” said Harry quickly, “but, er, is there
any particular reason you’re here?”
“Oh, yes, sir,” said Dobby earnestly. “Dobby has come to tell you, sir . . . it
is difficult, sir . . . Dobby wonders where to begin. . . ."
Who is the Half-Blood Prince?,Severus Snape,"The Half-Blood Prince is a mysterious figure whose identity is not fully revealed until the end of the book. However, it is eventually discovered that the Half-Blood Prince is actually a nickname used by Professor Snape, who was writing notes and comments in one of Harry's schoolbooks.","n of his father had reminded him that there was something he
had been looking forward to asking Lupin.
“Have you ever heard of someone called the Half-Blood Prince?”
“The Half-Blood what?”
“Prince,” said Harry, watching him closely for signs of recognition.
“There are no Wizarding princes,” said Lupin, now smiling. “Is this a title
you’re thinking of adopting? I should have thought being ‘the Chosen One’
would be enough.”
“It’s nothing to do with me!” said Harry indignantly. “The Half-Blood
Prince is someon n birth to a —”
“— murderer,” spat Harry.
“Well . . . yes,” said Hermione. “So . . . I was sort of right. Snape must have
been proud of being ‘half a Prince,’ you see? Tobias Snape was a Muggle
from what it said in the 
Prophet.
”
“Yeah, that fits,” said Harry. “He’d play up the pure-blood side so he could
get in with Lucius Malfoy and the rest of them. . . . He’s just like Voldemort.
Pure-blood mother, Muggle father . . . ashamed of his parentage, trying to
make himself feared using the Dark Arts, gave him  If, say, her father wasa wizard whose surname was Prince, and her mother was a Muggle, then that
would make her a ‘half-blood Prince’!”
“Yeah, very ingenious, Hermione . . .”
“But it would! Maybe she was proud of being half a Prince!”
“Listen, Hermione, I can tell it’s not a girl. I can just tell.”
“The truth is that you don’t think a girl would have been clever enough,”
said Hermione angrily.
“How can I have hung round with you for five years and not think girls are
clever?” said Harry, stung by this. “It from the Half-Blood Prince than Snape or Slughorn have taught
me in —”
“I’m not talking about your stupid so-called Prince,” said Hermione, giving
his book a nasty look as though it had been rude to her. “I’m talking about
earlier. I went into the girls’ bathroom just before I came in here and there
were about a dozen girls in there, including that Romilda Vane, trying to
decide how to slip you a love potion. They’re all hoping they’re going to get
you to take them to Slughorn’s party, and they all seem to  at!” said Hermione, her cheeks reddening. “I
just think it’s very irresponsible to start performing spells when you don’t
even know what they’re for, and stop talking about ‘the Prince’ as if it’s his
title, I bet it’s just a stupid nickname, and it doesn’t seem as though he was a
very nice person to me!”
“I don’t see where you get that from,” said Harry heatedly. “If he’d been a
budding Death Eater he wouldn’t have been boasting about being ‘half-
blood,’ would he?”
Even as he said it, Harry remembered tha y just remembered.
“What?” said Ron and Hermione together.
“My dad used this spell,” said Harry. “I — Lupin told me.”
This last part was not true; in fact, Harry had seen his father use the spell
on Snape, but he had never told Ron and Hermione about that particular
excursion into the Pensieve. Now, however, a wonderful possibility occurred
to him. Could the Half-Blood Prince possibly be — ?
“Maybe your dad did use it, Harry,” said Hermione, “but he’s not the only
one. We’ve seen a whole bunch of people use self an impressive new
name — 
Lord
 Voldemort — the Half-Blood 
Prince —
 how could Dumbledore
have missed — ?”
He broke off, looking out the window. He could not stop himself dwelling
upon Dumbledore’s inexcusable trust in Snape . . . but as Hermione had just
inadvertently reminded him, he, Harry, had been taken in just the same. . . . Inspite of the increasing nastiness of those scribbled spells, he had refused to
believe ill of the boy who had been so clever, who had helped him so
much. . . .
Helped him have chosen wrong!” said Harry. “He might have marked the
wrong person!”
“He chose the boy he thought most likely to be a danger to him,” said
Dumbledore. “And notice this, Harry. He chose, not the pureblood (which,
according to his creed, is the only kind of wizard worth being or knowing),
but the half-blood, like himself. He saw himself in you before he had ever
seen you, and in marking you with that scar, he did not kill you, as he
intended, but gave you powers, and a future, which have fitted you to esc"
What is the spell to summon objects?,Accio,"The spell to summon objects is ""Accio"".","Summoning Charm.
“That’s better, Harry, that’s loads better,” Hermione said, looking exhausted
but very pleased.
“Well, now we know what to do next time I can’t manage a spell,” Harry
said, throwing a rune dictionary back to Hermione, so he could try again,
“threaten me with a dragon. Right . . .” He raised his wand once more. 
“Accio
Dictionary!”
The heavy book soared out of Hermione’s hand, flew across the room, and
Harry caught it.
“Harry, I really think you’ve got it!” said Hermione delightedly.
“Just a y, pointing the wand’s beam at it. This looked
like some kind of enchantment. He wondered whether he might be able to
blast it out of the way.
“Reducto!”
 he said.
The spell shot straight through the mist, leaving it intact. He supposed he
should have known better; the Reductor Curse was for solid objects. What
would happen if he walked through the mist? Was it worth chancing it, or
should he double back?
He was still hesitating when a scream shattered the silence.
“Fleur?” Harry yelled.
There was silence.  agic?” he repeated in a whisper.“That’s right,” said Dumbledore.
“It’s . . . it’s magic, what I can do?”
“What is it that you can do?”
“All sorts,” breathed Riddle. A flush of excitement was rising up his neck
into his hollow cheeks; he looked fevered. “I can make things move without
touching them. I can make animals do what I want them to do, without
training them. I can make bad things happen to people who annoy me. I can
make them hurt if I want to.”
His legs were trembling. He stumbled forward and sat d  to cast their Patronuses: Luna, Ernie, and
Seamus.
“That’s right,” said Luna encouragingly, as if they were back in the Room
of Requirement and this was simply spell practice for the D.A. “That’s right,
Harry . . . come on, think of something happy. . . .”
“Something happy?” he said, his voice cracked.
“We’re all still here,” she whispered, “we’re still fighting. Come on,
now. . . .”
There was a silver spark, then a wavering light, and then, with the greatest
effort it had ever cost him, the stag burst fro to run.
“Stupefy!”
 Harry yelled.
The spell hit Krum in the back; he stopped dead in his tracks, fell forward,and lay motionless, facedown in the grass. Harry dashed over to Cedric, who
had stopped twitching and was lying there panting, his hands over his face.
“Are you all right?” Harry said roughly, grabbing Cedric’s arm.
“Yeah,” panted Cedric. “Yeah . . . I don’t believe it . . . he crept up behind
me. . . . I heard him, I turned around, and he had his wand on me. . . .”
Cedric got up. He was still shaki n you, Harry,
that the charm might be too advanced for you. Many qualified wizards have
difficulty with it.”
“What does a Patronus look like?” said Harry curiously.
“Each one is unique to the wizard who conjures it.”
“And how do you conjure it?”“With an incantation, which will work only if you are concentrating, with
all your might, on a single, very happy memory.”
Harry cast his mind about for a happy memory. Certainly, nothing that had
happened to him at the Dursleys’ was going to do. Finally, he settled  ion, it isagainst nature.”
“But how do you do it?”
“By an act of evil — the supreme act of evil. By committing murder.
Killing rips the soul apart. The wizard intent upon creating a Horcrux would
use the damage to his advantage: He would encase the torn portion —”
“Encase? But how — ?”
“There is a spell, do not ask me, I don’t know!” said Slughorn, shaking his
head like an old elephant bothered by mosquitoes. “Do I look as though I
have tried it — do I look like a killer?”
“No, sir, of course not,” said Rid a cupboard under my desk he’ll like.”
“Okay,” said Harry, trying to sound as though he wasn’t apprehensive at all
and merely glad that Lupin had found such a good substitute for a real
dementor.
“So . . .” Professor Lupin had taken out his own wand, and indicated that
Harry should do the same. “The spell I am going to try and teach you is
highly advanced magic, Harry — well beyond Ordinary Wizarding Level. It
is called the Patronus Charm.”
“How does it work?” said Harry nervously.
“Well, when it works corre"
Who is the defense against the dark arts teacher in Harry's first year?,Quirinus Quirrell,The Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher in Harry's first year is Professor Quirrell.,"was still fighting his way across the
lake with the first years; Professor McGonagall was presumably supervisingthe drying of the entrance hall floor, but there was another empty chair too,
and Harry couldn’t think who else was missing.
“Where’s the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher?” said Hermione,
who was also looking up at the teachers.
They had never yet had a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher who had
lasted more than three terms. Harry’s favorite by far had been Professor
Lupin, who had res he teaches?” said Ron, frowning at Professor Lupin’s pallid
profile.
“That’s obvious,” whispered Hermione. “There’s only one vacancy, isn’t
there? Defense Against the Dark Arts.”
Harry, Ron, and Hermione had already had two Defense Against the Dark
Arts teachers, both of whom had lasted only one year. There were rumors that
the job was jinxed.
“Well, I hope he’s up to it,” said Ron doubtfully. “He looks like one good
hex would finish him off, doesn’t he? Anyway . . .” He turned to Harry.
“What were you goin e,” said Lupin. “I tried to follow him, but was thrown back just like
Neville. . . .”“He must have known a spell we didn’t,” whispered McGonagall. “After
all — he was the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. . . . I just assumed
that he was in a hurry to chase after the Death Eaters who’d escaped up to the
tower. . . .”
“He was,” said Harry savagely, “but to help them, not to stop them . . . and
I’ll bet you had to have a Dark Mark to get through that barrier — so what
happened when he came back down?”
“W e Against the Dark Arts teacher, I quite agree
that you had to check. Ron, Hermione, you shouldn’t be quite so quick to
lower your defenses.”
They ran down the stairs toward him. Wrapped in a thick black travelingcloak, he looked exhausted, but pleased to see them.
“No sign of Severus, then?” he asked.
“No,” said Harry. “What’s going on? Is everyone okay?”
“Yes,” said Lupin, “but we’re all being watched. There are a couple of
Death Eaters in the square outside —”
“We know —”
“I had to Apparate very precisel Dark Arts. Here, for the first time, Harry
felt sure he had passed. He had no problem with any of the written questions
and took particular pleasure, during the practical examination, in performing
all the counterjinxes and defensive spells right in front of Umbridge, who was
watching coolly from near the doors into the entrance hall.
“Oh bravo!” cried Professor Tofty, who was examining Harry again, whenHarry demonstrated a perfect boggart banishing spell. “Very good indeed!
Well, I think that’s all, Potter ogether, turning to stare at Harry. “But
you said —”
“Professor Snape, meanwhile,” said Dumbledore, raising his voice so that it
carried over all the muttering, “will be taking over the position of Defense
Against the Dark Arts teacher.”
“No!” said Harry, so loudly that many heads turned in his direction. He didnot care; he was staring up at the staff table, incensed. How could Snape be
given the Defense Against the Dark Arts job after all this time? Hadn’t it been
widely known for years that Dumbledore did gainst the Dark Arts,” said
Hermione.
“Me?” said Harry, now grinning more broadly than ever. “No I’m not,
you’ve beaten me in every test —”
“Actually, I haven’t,” said Hermione coolly. “You beat me in our third year
— the only year we both sat the test and had a teacher who actually knew the
subject. But I’m not talking about test results, Harry. Look what you’ve
done
!”
“How d’you mean?”
“You know what, I’m not sure I want someone this stupid teaching me,”
Ron said to Hermione, smirking slightly. He turned ne —”
“— and Umbridge herself.”
“Well, be a good boy and keep your temper with Umbridge today,” said
George. “Angelina’ll do her nut if you miss any more Quidditch practices.”
But Harry did not have to wait for Defense Against the Dark Arts to meetProfessor Umbridge. He was pulling out his dream diary in a seat at the very
back of the shadowy Divination room when Ron elbowed him in the ribs and,
looking round, he saw Professor Umbridge emerging through the trapdoor in
the floor. The class, which had been ta"

“
You
 let the troll in?”
“Certainly. I have a special gift with trolls — you must have seen what I
did to the one in the chamber back there? Unfortunately, while everyone else
was running around looking for it, Snape, who already suspected me, went
straight to the third floor to head me off — and not only did my troll fail to
beat you to death, that three-headed dog didn’t even manage to bite Snape’s
leg off properly.
“Now, wait quietly, P ht into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a dog thatfilled the whole space between ceiling and floor. It had three heads. Three
pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching and quivering in their
direction; three drooling mouths, saliva hanging in slippery ropes from
yellowish fangs.
It was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and Harry knew that
the only reason they weren’t already dead was that their sudden appearance
had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over that, there wa  Mr. Flamel,
who celebrated his six hundred and sixty-fifth birthday last year,
enjoys a quiet life in Devon with his wife, Perenelle (six hundred
and fifty-eight).
“See?” said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had finished. “The dog must be
guarding Flamel’s Sorcerer’s Stone! I bet he asked Dumbledore to keep it safe
for him, because they’re friends and he knew someone was after it, that’s why
he wanted the Stone moved out of Gringotts!”
“A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying!” said Harry. “No

knight turned his helmeted head to look down at Ron.
“Do we — er — have to join you to get across?”
The black knight nodded. Ron turned to the other two.“This needs thinking about. . . .” he said. “I suppose we’ve got to take the
place of three of the black pieces. . . .”
Harry and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron think. Finally he said,
“Now, don’t be offended or anything, but neither of you are that good at chess

“We’re   a third stone
effigy came back to him: that of an ugly old warlock, onto whose head Harry
himself had placed a wig and a battered old tiara. The shock shot through
Harry with the heat of firewhisky, and he nearly stumbled.
He knew, at last, where the Horcrux sat waiting for him. . . .Tom Riddle, who confided in no one and operated alone, might have been
arrogant enough to assume that he, and only he, had penetrated the deepest
mysteries of Hogwarts Castle. Of course, Dumbledore and Flitwick, those
model pu ve him. The Snitch! He tried to catch it,
but his arms were too heavy.
He blinked. It wasn’t the Snitch at all. It was a pair of glasses. How strange.
He blinked again. The smiling face of Albus Dumbledore swam into view
above him.
“Good afternoon, Harry,” said Dumbledore.
Harry stared at him. Then he remembered: “Sir! The Stone! It was Quirrell!
He’s got the Stone! Sir, quick —”
“Calm yourself, dear boy, you are a little behind the times,” said
Dumbledore. “Quirrell does not have the Stone.”
“Then who does ering what could possibly need such heavy protection.
“It’s either really valuable or really dangerous,” said Ron.
“Or both,” said Harry.
But as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was
about two inches long, they didn’t have much chance of guessing what it was
without further clues.
Neither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay
underneath the dog and the trapdoor. All Neville cared about was never going
near the dog again.
Hermione was now refusing to spea ound out how to get past him without asking Hagrid,”
said Ron, looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them. “I bet
there’s a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant three-
headed dog. So what do we do, Harry?”
The light of adventure was kindling again in Ron’s eyes, but Hermione
answered before Harry could.
“Go to Dumbledore. That’s what we should have done ages ago. If we try
anything ourselves we’ll be thrown out for sure.”
“But we’ve got no

What creature is Aragog?,Acromantula,"Aragog is a giant spider, specifically a Acromantula.","pes shifted all around him.
“The thing that lives in the castle,” said Aragog, “is an ancient creature we
spiders fear above all others. Well do I remember how I pleaded with Hagrid
to let me go, when I sensed the beast moving about the school.”
“What is it?” said Harry urgently.
More loud clicking, more rustling; the spiders seemed to be closing in.
“We do not speak of it!” said Aragog fiercely. “We do not name it! I never
even told Hagrid the name of that dread creature, though he asked me, many
times.”
H Aragog.”
“Aragog,” said Harry and Hagrid together.
Both Slughorn and Hagrid drank deeply. Harry, however, with the way
ahead illuminated for him by Felix Felicis, knew that he must not drink, so he
merely pretended to take a gulp and then set the mug back on the table before
him.
“I had him from an egg, yeh know,” said Hagrid morosely. “Tiny little

flood of his tears. “See, the rest o’ the tribe . . . Aragog’s fa  the misty, domed web, a spider the size of a small

“Men,” clicked the spider who had caught Harry.

vaguely.

onto the compost heap, crying harder than ever.
“There, there,” said Slughorn, waving his wand so that the huge pile of
earth ro d with the light
spilling from Hagrid’s window to illuminate Aragog’s body lying on the edge
of a massive pit beside a ten-foot-high mound of freshly dug earth.
“Magnificent,” said Slughorn, approaching the spider’s head, where eight
milky eyes stared blankly at the sky and two huge, curved pincers shone,
motionless, in the moonlight. Harry thought he heard the tinkle of bottles as
Slughorn bent over the pincers, apparently examining the enormous hairy
head.

raised her eyebrows, and she let out a reluctant giggle.

CHAPTER EIGHT
THE WEDDING
hree o’clock on the following afternoon found Harry, Ron, Fred, and
George standing outside the great white marquee in the orchard,
awaiting the arrival of the wedding guests. Harry had taken a large dose of
Polyjuice Potion and was now the double of a redheaded Muggle boy from
the local village, Ottery St. Catchpo .
Mrs. Cattermole gave a single, shaky nod.“Married to Reginald Cattermole of the Magical Maintenance
Department?”
Mrs. Cattermole burst into tears.
“I don’t know where he is, he was supposed to meet me here!”
Umbridge ignored her.
“Mother to Maisie, Ellie, and Alfred Cattermole?”
Mrs. Cattermole sobbed harder than ever.
“They’re frightened, they think I might not come home —”
“Spare us,” spat Yaxley. “The brats of Mudbloods do not stir our
sympathies.”
Mrs. Cattermole’s sobs masked Harry’s footsteps as he  f wizard pictures of his
mother and father. He sat down on his bed, drew the hangings around him,
and started turning the pages, searching, until . . .
He stopped on a picture of his parents’ wedding day. There was his father
waving up at him, beaming, the untidy black hair Harry had inheritedstanding up in all directions. There was his mother, alight with happiness, arm
in arm with his dad. And there . . . that must be him. Their best man . . . Harry

If he hadn’t known said to us once before,” said Hermione quietly, “that there was time to
turn back if we wanted to. We’ve had time, haven’t we?”
“We’re with you whatever happens,” said Ron. “But mate, you’re going to
have to come round my mum and dad’s house before we do anything else,
even Godric’s Hollow.”
“Why?”
“Bill and Fleur’s wedding, remember?”
Harry looked at him, startled; the idea that anything as normal as a wedding
could still exist seemed incredible and yet wonderful.
“Yeah, we shouldn’t miss that,” he said fi"

“Undesirable Number One,” Harry muttered under his breath as he
replaced Mr. Weasley’s folder and s turned a page loudly, and Dumbledore’s name leapt out at him. It was a
moment or two before he took in the meaning of the photograph, which
showed a family group. Beneath the photograph were the words:
 The
Dumbledore family, left to right: Albus; Percival, holding newborn Ariana;
Kendra; and Aberforth.
His attention caught, Harry examined the picture more carefully.
Dumbledore’s father, Percival, was a good-looking man with eyes that
seemed to twinkle even in this faded old photograph. The baby, Ariana, wa

Mrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. Dursley wondered
whether he dared tell her he’d heard the name “Potter.” He decided he didn’tdare. Instead he said, as casually as he could, “Their son — he’d be about
Dudley’s age now, wouldn’t he?”
“I suppose so,” said Mrs. Dursley stiffly.
“What’s his name again? Howard, isn’t it?”
“Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.”
“Oh, yes,” said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. “Yes, I quite agree.”
He didn’t say another wo ?” asked Harry, who found Ron just as
interesting as Ron found him.
“Er — yes, I think so,” said Ron. “I think Mum’s got a second cousin
who’s an accountant, but we never talk about him.”
“So you must know loads of magic already.”The Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale boy
in Diagon Alley had talked about.
“I heard you went to live with Muggles,” said Ron. “What are they like?”
“Horrible — well, not all of them. My aunt and uncle and cousin are,
though. Wish I’d had three wiza  If, say, her father wasa wizard whose surname was Prince, and her mother was a Muggle, then that
would make her a ‘half-blood Prince’!”
“Yeah, very ingenious, Hermione . . .”
“But it would! Maybe she was proud of being half a Prince!”
“Listen, Hermione, I can tell it’s not a girl. I can just tell.”
“The truth is that you don’t think a girl would have been clever enough,”
said Hermione angrily.
“How can I have hung round with you for five years and not think girls are
clever?” said Harry, stung by this. “It five of the
Weasley children currently attend.
Harry scanned the moving photograph, and a grin spread across his face as
he saw all nine of the Weasleys waving furiously at him, standing in front of a
large pyramid. Plump little Mrs. Weasley; tall, balding Mr. Weasley; six sons;
and one daughter, all (though the black-and-white picture didn’t show it) with
flaming-red hair. Right in the middle of the picture was Ron, tall and
gangling, with his pet rat, Scabbers, on his shoulder and his arm around his

have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine. I think
they should keep it in the old wizarding families. What’s your surname,
anyway?”
But before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, “That’s you done, my
dear,” and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped
down from the footstool.
“Well, I’ll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,” said the drawling boy.
Harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cre get
some more money —”
“Don’t be ridiculous, Ron,” said Mr. Weasley, who on closer inspection
looked very strained. “Black’s not going to be caught by a thirteen-year-old
wizard. It’s the Azkaban guards who’ll get him back, you mark my words.”
At that moment Mrs. Weasley entered the bar, laden with shopping bags
and followed by the twins, Fred and George, who were about to start their
fifth year at Hogwarts; the newly elected Head Boy, Percy; and the Weasleys’
youngest child and only girl, Ginny.

What is the name of the wand shop in Diagon Alley?,Ollivanders,The wand shop in Diagon Alley is Ollivander's.,". He was a good man,
Florean.”
“Talking of Diagon Alley,” said Mr. Weasley, “looks like Ollivander’s gone
too.”
“The wandmaker?” said Ginny, looking startled.
“That’s the one. Shop’s empty. No sign of a struggle. No one knows
whether he left voluntarily or was kidnapped.”
“But wands — what’ll people do for wands?”
“They’ll make do with other makers,” said Lupin. “But Ollivander was the
best, and if the other side have got him it’s not so good for us.”
The day after this rather gloomy birthday tea, their let le eyes standing quietly by the window. Harry had met Mr.
Ollivander before — he was the wandmaker from whom Harry had bought
his own wand over three years ago in Diagon Alley.
“Mademoiselle Delacour, could we have you first, please?” said Mr.Ollivander, stepping into the empty space in the middle of the room.
Fleur Delacour swept over to Mr. Ollivander and handed him her wand.
“Hmmm . . .” he said.
He twirled the wand between his long fingers like a baton and it emitted a
number of pink and gold sparks. Th cabbers was looking thinner than usual, and there was a definite droop to
his whiskers.
“There’s a magical creature shop just over there,” said Harry, who knew
Diagon Alley very well by now. “You could see if they’ve got anything for
Scabbers, and Hermione can get her owl.”
So they paid for their ice cream and crossed the street to the Magical
Menagerie.
There wasn’t much room inside. Every inch of wall was hidden by cages. It
was smelly and very noisy because the occupants of these cages were all
squeaking  thick woollen balaclava.
After breakfast Harry would go out into the backyard, take out his wand,
tap the third brick from the left above the trash bin, and stand back as the
archway into Diagon Alley opened in the wall.
Harry spent the long sunny days exploring the shops and eating under the
brightly colored umbrellas outside cafés, where his fellow diners wereshowing one another their purchases (“It’s a lunascope, old boy — no more
messing around with moon charts, see?”) or else discussing the case of Si e entrance
and paused, looking around.
Diagon Alley had changed. The colorful, glittering window displays of
spellbooks, potion ingredients, and cauldrons were lost to view, hidden behind
the large Ministry of Magic posters that had been pasted over them. Most of
these somber purple posters carried blown-up versions of the security advice
on the Ministry pamphlets that had been sent out over the summer, but others
bore moving black-and-white photographs of Death Eaters known to be on
the loose. Bellatrix Le , or Hermione
Granger this time.
Three boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle one at once: It was
the pale boy from Madam Malkin’s robe shop. He was looking at Harry with
a lot more interest than he’d shown back in Diagon Alley.
“Is it true?” he said. “They’re saying all down the train that Harry Potter’s
in this compartment. So it’s you, is it?”
“Yes,” said Harry. He was looking at the other boys. Both of them were
thickset and looked extremely mean. Standing on either side of the pale boy,
they loo .”
Harry shivered. He wasn’t sure he liked Mr. Ollivander too much. He paid
seven gold Galleons for his wand, and Mr. Ollivander bowed them from his
shop.The late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harry and Hagrid made their
way back down Diagon Alley, back through the wall, back through the Leaky
Cauldron, now empty. Harry didn’t speak at all as they walked down the road;
he didn’t even notice how much people were gawking at them on the
Underground, laden as they were with all their funny-shaped package se!”
But Harry did not lower his wand. Narcissa Malfoy smiled unpleasantly.
“I see that being Dumbledore’s favorite has given you a false sense of
security, Harry Potter. But Dumbledore won’t always be there to protect you.”
Harry looked mockingly all around the shop. “Wow . . . look at that . . . he’s
not here now! So why not have a go? They might be able to find you a double
cell in Azkaban with your loser of a husband!”
Malfoy made an angry movement toward Harry, but stumbled over his
overlong robe. Ron "

Professor McGonagall was gone in a swish of tartan.
“He says he’ll be delighted,” said a bored voice behind Dumbledore; the
wizard called Phineas had reappeared in front of his Slytherin banner. “My
great-great-grandson has always had odd taste in houseguests . . .”
“Come here, then,” Dumbledore said to Harry and the Weasleys. “And
quickly, before anyone else joins us . . .”
Harry and the others gathered around Dumbledore’s desk.
“You have all used  you are here, your House will be something like
your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your
House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free time in your House

“The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and
Slytherin. Each House has its own noble history and each has produced
outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs
will earn your House points, while any rule-breaking will lose House points.
At the end of the us,

House. Very cheeky answers I used to get back too.”
“Which was your House?”
“I was Head of Slytherin,” said Slughorn. “Oh, now,” he went on quickly,
seeing the expression on Harry’s face and wagging a stubby finger at him,
“don’t go holding that against me! You’ll be Gryffindor like her, I suppose?
Yes, it usually goes in families. Not always, though. Ever heard of Sirius
Black? You must have done — been in the papers for the last   withconcentration as he took aim again.
“PEEVES!” yelled an angry voice. “Peeves, come down here at ONCE!”
Professor McGonagall, deputy headmistress and Head of Gryffindor
House, had come dashing out of the Great Hall; she skidded on the wet floor
and grabbed Hermione around the neck to stop herself from falling.
“Ouch — sorry, Miss Granger —”
“That’s all right, Professor!” Hermione gasped, massaging her throat.
“Peeves, get down here NOW!” barked Professor McGonagall,
straightening her pointed hat and gla . .
“You all know, of course, that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years
ago — the precise date is uncertain — by the four greatest witches and
wizards of the age. The four school Houses are named after them: Godric
Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin.
They built this castle together, far from prying Muggle eyes, for it was an age
when magic was feared by common people, and witches and wizards suffered
much persecution.”
He paused, gazed blearily around the room, and c e wizard with a shock of white hair, was carrying an ancient hat and a
four-legged stool out of the hall.
“Oh,” said Hermione softly, “we’ve missed the Sorting!”
New students at Hogwarts were sorted into Houses by trying on the Sorting
Hat, which shouted out the House they were best suited to (Gryffindor,
Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, or Slytherin). Professor McGonagall strode off toward
her empty seat at the staff table, and Harry and Hermione set off in the other
direction, as quietly as possible, toward the Gry  the Slytherins. Then
the Hufflepuffs stood, and almost at the same moment, the Ravenclaws, all of
them with their backs to Harry, all of them looking toward Pansy instead, and
Harry, awestruck and overwhelmed, saw wands emerging everywhere, pulled
from beneath cloaks and from under sleeves.
“Thank you, Miss Parkinson,” said Professor McGonagall in a clipped
voice. “You will leave the Hall first with Mr. Filch. If the rest of your House
could follow.”
Harry heard the grinding of benches and then the sound o  had done at the top of the tower where Dumbledore
had died: of dirt, sweat, and blood.
“So you aren’t wanted, then, Vernon? Or are you on that list under a
different name? What House were you in at Hogwarts?”
“Slytherin,” said Harry automatically.
“Funny ’ow they all thinks we wants to ’ear that,” jeered Scabior out of the
shadows. “But none of ’em can tell us where the common room is.”
“It’s in the dungeons,” said Harry clearly. “You enter through the wall. It’sfull of skulls and stuff and it’s under the "

sealed with wax. “I wanted Ron to think I’d done it, so I faked it when I knew
you were looking.” He looked at Ron. “You saved everything because you felt
lucky. You did it all yourself.”
He pocketed the potion again.
“There really wasn’t anything in my pumpkin juice?” Ron said, astounded.
“But the weather’s good . . . and Vaisey couldn’t play. . . . I honestly haven’t

Harry shook his head. Ron gaped at him for a  as still

and murmuring,

 so that Neville,
who was passing the foot of his bed at the time, would not hear.
“Nice one, Harry!” said Ron enthusiastically, waving the new pair of
Quidditch Keeper’s gloves Harry had given him.
“No problem,” said Harry absentmindedly, as he searched the Slytherin
dormitory closely for Malfoy. “Hey . . . I don’t th putation for Potions brilliance you don’t deserve,” said
Hermione nastily.
“Give it a rest, Hermione!” said Ginny, and Harry was so amazed, so
grateful, he looked up. “By the sound of it, Malfoy was trying to use an
Unforgivable Curse, you should be glad Harry had something good up his
sleeve!”
“Well, of course I’m glad Harry wasn’t cursed!” said Hermione, clearly
stung. “But you can’t call that Sectumsempra spell good, Ginny, look where
it’s landed him! And I’d have thought, seeing what this has done to yo think?” said Harry bitterly.
“Lucky,” said Ron suddenly. “Harry, that’s it — get lucky!”
“What d’you mean?”
“Use your lucky potion!”
“Ron, that’s — that’s it!” said Hermione, sounding stunned. “Of course!
Why didn’t I think of it?”
Harry stared at them both. “Felix Felicis?” he said. “I dunno . . . I was sort
of saving it. . . .”
“What for?” demanded Ron incredulously.
“What on earth is more important than this memory, Harry?” asked
Hermione.
Harry did not answer. The thought of that little golden bottle ha  Potions class
was about as safe as poking a sleeping dragon in the eye.
Potions lessons took place in one of the large dungeons. Thursday
afternoon’s lesson proceeded in the usual way. Twenty cauldrons stood
steaming between the wooden desks, on which stood brass scales and jars of
ingredients. Snape prowled through the fumes, making waspish remarks about
the Gryffindors’ work while the Slytherins sniggered appreciatively. Draco
Malfoy, who was Snape’s favorite student, kept flicking puffer-fish eyes at

no comment, but occasionally gave the potions a stir or a sniff. At last he
reached the table where Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ernie were sitting. He
smiled ruefully at the tarlike substance in Ron’s cauldron. He passed over
Ernie’s navy concoction. Hermione’s potion he gave an approving nod. Then
he saw Harry’s, and a look of incredulous delight spread over his face.
“The clear winner!” he cried to the dungeon. “Excellent, excellent, Harry!

someone to go with you, that’ll stop all the others thinking they’ve still got a

“There isn’t anyone I want to invite,” mumbled Harry, who was still trying
not to think about Ginny any more than he could help, despite the fact that she
kept cropping up in his dreams in ways that made him devoutly thankful that
Ron could not perform Legilimency.
“Well, just be careful what you drink, because Romilda Vane look d just taken out of her bag.
“Luck can only get you so far, Harry. The situation with Slughorn was

“Yeah . . . I — er . . . thanks,” said Harry weakly.
“What is this thing?” said Moody, drawing the Marauder’s Map out of his
pocket and unfolding it.
“Map of Hogwarts,” said Harry, hoping Moody was going to pull him out
of the staircase soon; his leg was really hurting him.
“Merlin’s beard,” Moody whispered, staring at the map, his magical eye
going haywire. “This . . . this is some map, Potter!”

It was a map showing every detail of the Hogwarts castle and grounds. But
the truly remarkable thing were the tiny ink dots moving around it, each
labeled with a name in minuscule writing. Astounded, Harry bent over it. A
labeled dot in the top left corner showed that Professor Dumbledore was
pacing his study; the caretaker’s cat, Mrs. Norris, was prowling the second
floor; and Peeves the Poltergeist was currently bouncing around the trophy
room. And as Harry’s eyes traveled up and down th Invisibility Cloak and
throwing it over both of them. He gave the wall a little push.
It melted away at his touch and they slipped outside: Harry glanced back
and saw that it had resealed itself at once. They were standing in a dark
corridor: Harry pulled Luna back into the shadows, fumbled in the pouch
around his neck, and took out the Marauder’s Map. Holding it close to his
nose he searched, and located his and Luna’s dots at last.
“We’re up on the fifth floor,” he whispered, watching Filch moving away

and began to rummage in it, while Ron watched impatiently.
“Harry . . .”“Malfoy’s using Crabbe and Goyle as lookouts. He was arguing with

He had found it, a folded square of apparently blank parchment, which he

“Maybe the Marauders never knew the room was there,” said Ron.
“I think it’ll be part of the magic of the room,” said Hermione. “If you need
it to be Unplottable, it will be.”
“Dobby, have you managed to get in to have a look at what Malfoy’s
doing?” said Harry eagerly.
“No, Harry Potter, that is impossible,” said Dobby.
“No, it’s not,” said Harry at once. “Malfoy got into our headquarters there

front doors.
“’Bye!” Harry called to Ron. “See you when you get back!”
Ron grinned and winked.Harry hurried up to the third floor, slipping the Marauder’s Map out of his
pocket as he went. Crouching behind the one-eyed witch, he smoothed it out.

“The Triwizard Tournament was first established some seven hundred years
ago as a friendly competition between the three largest European schools of

to represent each school, and the three champions competed in three magical

There was a sound of scurrying feet behind him, and Ludo Bagman entered

Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two
lemon drops, seemed not to notice. “It all gets so confusing if we keep saying
‘You-Know-Who.’ I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying
Voldemort’s name.”
“I know you haven’t,” said Professor McGonagall, sounding half
exasperated, half admiring. “But you’re different. Everyone knows you’re the
only one You-Know- oh, all right,  rs of his name rearranged
themselves:
I AM LORD VOLDEMORT
“You see?” he whispered. “It was a name I was already using at Hogwarts,
to my most intimate friends only, of course. You think I was going to use my
filthy Muggle father’s name forever? I, in whose veins runs the blood of
Salazar Slytherin himself, through my mother’s side? I, keep the name of a
foul, common Muggle, who abandoned me even before I was born, just
because he found out his wife was a witch? No, Harry — I fashioned myself a
new name, a n n his long,
crooked nose at its burnt and soggy pages.
“Brilliant,” he said softly. “Of course, he was probably the most brilliantstudent Hogwarts has ever seen.” He turned around to the Weasleys, who
were looking utterly bewildered.
“Very few people know that Lord Voldemort was once called Tom Riddle. I
taught him myself, fifty years ago, at Hogwarts. He disappeared after leaving
the school . . . traveled far and wide . . . sank so deeply into the Dark Arts,
consorted with the very worst of our kind, under 
their charges’ youthful beginnings.”
He raised his glass as though toasting Voldemort, whose face remained
expressionless. Nevertheless, Harry felt the atmosphere in the room change
subtly: Dumbledore’s refusal to use Voldemort’s chosen name was a refusal to
allow Voldemort to dictate the terms of the meeting, and Harry could tell that
Voldemort took it as such.
“I am surprised you have remained here so long,” said Voldemort after a
short pause. “I always wondered why a wizard such as yourself never wished s about He-Who-Must-Not-Be-
Named?” Rita asked Hermione in a hushed voice.
“Yes, I do,” said Hermione. “The true story. All the facts. Exactly as Harry
reports them. He’ll give you all the details, he’ll tell you the names of the
undiscovered Death Eaters he saw there, he’ll tell you what Voldemort looks
like now — oh, get a grip on yourself,” she added contemptuously, throwing a
napkin across the table, for at the sound of Voldemort’s name, Rita had
jumped so badly that she had slopped half her glass of fi age. This is understandable, of course; he had grown up in an
orphanage and naturally wished to know how he came to be there. It seems
that he searched in vain for some trace of Tom Riddle senior on the shields in

What spell is used to produce light from a wand?,Lumos,"The spell used to produce light from a wand is not explicitly mentioned in this context. However, it is implied that the spell is not a specific incantation, but rather a magical property of the wand itself.

“The thing is,” whispered Hermione through the dark, “we could have
achieved that with Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder.”
There was a small 
click,
 and the ball of light from the lamp flew back to the
ceiling and illuminated them all once more.
“Still, it’s cool,” said Ron, a little defensively. “And from what they said,
Dumbledore invented it himself!”
“I know, but surely he wouldn’t have singled you out in his will just to help
us turn out the lights!”“D’you think he knew the  bead of light right back into Voldemort’s wand . . . and slowly . . .
very slowly . . . it moved along the golden thread . . . it trembled for a
moment . . . and then it connected. . . .
At once, Voldemort’s wand began to emit echoing screams of pain . . . then

of the tip of it and vanished . . . the ghost of the hand he had made
Wormtail . . . more shouts of pain . . . and then something much larger began
to blossom from Voldemort’s w  lighting his own wand hastily as he went.
An eerie sight met their eyes: They were standing on the edge of a great
black lake, so vast that Harry could not make out the distant banks, in a
cavern so high that the ceiling too was out of sight. A misty greenish light
shone far away in what looked like the middle of the lake; it was reflected in
the completely still water below. The greenish glow and the light from the
two wands were the only things that broke the otherwise velvety blackness,
though their ray like a set of scales with only one dish. It
began to vibrate. A narrow strip of parchment came speeding out of a slit in
the base. The wizard tore this off and read the writing upon it.
“Eleven inches, phoenix-feather core, been in use four years. That correct?”
“Yes,” said Harry nervously.
“I keep this,” said the wizard, impaling the slip of parchment on a small
brass spike. “You get this back,” he added, thrusting the wand at Harry.
“Thank you.”
“Hang on . . .” said the wizard slowly.
His eyes had darted  e . . . and Lord Voldemort rewards his helpers. . . .”
Voldemort raised his wand again and whirled it through the air. A streak of
what looked like molten silver hung shining in the wand’s wake. Momentarily
shapeless, it writhed and then formed itself into a gleaming replica of a
human hand, bright as moonlight, which soared downward and fixed itself
upon Wormtail’s bleeding wrist.
Wormtail’s sobbing stopped abruptly. His breathing harsh and ragged, he
raised his head and stared in disbelief at the silver h lt a creeping chill behind him that could mean only
one thing. There was more than one.
“DUDLEY, KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT! WHATEVER YOU DO,
KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT! Wand!” Harry muttered frantically, his hands
flying over the ground like spiders. “Where’s — wand — come on —
Lumos!
”
He said the spell automatically, desperate for light to help him in his search
— and to his disbelieving relief, light flared inches from his right hand — the
wand-tip had ignited. Harry snatched it up, scrambled to his feet, and turne eyes furious, fixed . . .and slowly, very slowly, the beads quivered to a halt, and then, just as slowly,
they began to move the other way . . . and it was Voldemort’s wand that was

fearful. . . .
One of the beads of light was quivering, inches from the tip of Voldemort’s
wand. Harry didn’t understand why he was doing it, didn’t know what it
might achieve . . . but he now concentrated as he had never done in his life on
forcing that  ther he could make out his fingers when it
happened.
A bright silver light appeared right ahead of him, moving through the trees.
Whatever the source, it was moving soundlessly. The light seemed simply to
drift toward him.
He jumped to his feet, his voice frozen in his throat, and raised Hermione’s
wand. He screwed up his eyes as the light became blinding, the trees in front
of it pitch-black in silhouette, and still the thing came closer. . . .
And then the source of the light stepped out from behind an oa"
What is the name of Hermione's cat?,Crookshanks,The name of Hermione's cat is Crookshanks.,"y had only gone a few paces when Hermione’s bandy-legged ginger
cat, Crookshanks, came pelting out of the garden, bottlebrush tail held high in
the air, chasing what looked like a muddy potato on legs. Harry recognized it
instantly as a gnome. Barely ten inches high, its horny little feet pattered very
fast as it sprinted across the yard and dived headlong into one of the
Wellington boots that lay scattered around the door. Harry could hear the
gnome giggling madly as Crookshanks inserted a paw into the boo  Harry. The cat’s ginger fur was thick
and fluffy, but it was definitely a bit bowlegged and its face looked grumpy
and oddly squashed, as though it had run headlong into a brick wall. Now that
Scabbers was out of sight, however, the cat was purring contentedly in
Hermione’s arms.
“Hermione, that thing nearly scalped me!” said Ron.
“He didn’t mean to, did you, Crookshanks?” said Hermione.
“And what about Scabbers?” said Ron, pointing at the lump in his chest
pocket. “He needs rest and relaxation! How’s he g  you still got Millicent’s nose or
something?”
Hermione let her robes fall and Ron backed into the sink.
Her face was covered in black fur. Her eyes had turned yellow and there
were long, pointed ears poking through her hair.
“It was a c-cat hair!” she howled. “M-Millicent Bulstrode m-must have a
cat! And the p-potion isn’t supposed to be used for animal transformations!”
“Uh-oh,” said Ron.
“You’ll be teased something 
dreadful

“It’s okay, Hermione,” said Harry quickly. “We’ll take y  himself
between them and looking uncharacteristically serious.
“What?” said Harry.
“Hermione,” said Hagrid.
“What about her?” said Ron.
“She’s in a righ’ state, that’s what. She’s bin comin’ down ter visit me a lotsince Chris’mas. Bin feelin’ lonely. Firs’ yeh weren’ talking to her because o’
the Firebolt, now yer not talkin’ to her because her cat —”
“— ate Scabbers!” Ron interjected angrily.
“Because her cat acted like all cats do,” Hagrid continued doggedly. “She’s
cried a fair few times, yeh know. Goin  ! Oh, it’s you,” said Ron in relief, as Harry
entered the room. Ron lay back down on the bed, which he had evidently just
vacated. The room was just as messy as it had been all week; the only change
was that Hermione was now sitting in the far corner, her fluffy ginger cat,
Crookshanks, at her feet, sorting books, some of which Harry recognized as
his own, into two enormous piles.
“Hi, Harry,” she said, as he sat down on his camp bed.
“And how did you manage to get away?”
“Oh, Ron’s mum forgot that she ask es since I last bought him school robes. Are you hungry, Harry?”
“Yeah, I am,” said Harry, suddenly realizing just how hungry he was.
“Sit down, dear, I’ll knock something up.”
As Harry sat down, a furry ginger cat with a squashed face jumped onto his
knees and settled there, purring.“So Hermione’s here?” he asked happily as he tickled Crookshanks behind
the ears.
“Oh yes, she arrived the day before yesterday,” said Mrs. Weasley, rapping
a large iron pot with her wand. It bounced onto the stove with a loud  front

of the corridor, as silence fell among the mass of students pressing forward to
see the grisly sight.
Then someone shouted through the quiet.
“Enemies of the Heir, beware! You’ll be next, Mudbloods!”
It was Draco Malfoy. He had pushed to the front of the crowd, his cold eyes
alive, his usually bloodless face flushed, as he grinned at the sight of the
hanging, immobile cat.W

“What 
was
 that?”
“It was either a very big cat or quite a small tiger,” said Harry.
“Where’s Hermione?”
“Probably getting her owl —”
They made their way back up the crowded street to the Magical Menagerie.
As they reached it, Hermione came out, but she wasn’t carrying an owl. Her
arms were clamped tightly around the enormous ginger cat.
“You

 that monster?” said Ron, his mouth hanging open.

green rat tails. “Right before you go into the lake, sir — gillyweed!”
“What’s it do?” said Harry, staring at the gillyweed.
“It will make Harry Potter breathe underwater, sir!”
“Dobby,” said Harry frantically, “listen — are you sure about this?”
He couldn’t quite forget that the last time Dobby had tried to “help” him,
he had ended up with no bones in his right arm.
“Dobby is quite sure, sir!” said the elf earnestly. “Dobby hears things, sir,
he is   guide Harry Potter through the Triwizard Tournament without
appearing to do so. A servant who would watch over Harry Potter. Ensure he
reached the Triwizard Cup. Turn the Cup into a Portkey, which would take the
first person to touch it to my master. But first —”
“You needed Alastor Moody,” said Dumbledore. His blue eyes were
blazing, though his voice remained calm.
“Wormtail and I did it. We had prepared the Polyjuice Potion beforehand.
We journeyed to his house. Moody put up a struggle. There was a commo d him.
“I’ve got to go and look for people who can’t use their voices above the
ground. . . .” he said slowly. “Er . . . who could that be?”
“Slow, aren’t you?”
He had never seen Moaning Myrtle so cheerful, apart from the day when a
dose of Polyjuice Potion had given Hermione the hairy face and tail of a cat.
Harry stared around the bathroom, thinking . . . if the voices could only be
heard underwater, then it made sense for them to belong to underwater
creatures. He ran this theory past Myrtle, who smirked  did not think
that Dumbledore could hear him; he had rolled onto his side and was drawing
great, rattling breaths that sounded agonizing. 
“Aguamenti — Aguamenti —
AGUAMENTI!”
The goblet filled and emptied once more. And now Dumbledore’s
breathing was fading. His brain whirling in panic, Harry knew, instinctively,
the only way left to get water, because Voldemort had planned it so . . .
He flung himself over to the edge of the rock and plunged the goblet into
the lake, bringing it up full to the brim of ic 
 he shouted, jabbing the goblet with his wand.
The goblet filled with clear water; Harry dropped to his knees beside
Dumbledore, raised his head, and brought the glass to his lips — but it was
empty. Dumbledore groaned and began to pant.
“But I had some — wait — 
Aguamenti!
” said Harry again, pointing his
wand at the goblet. Once more, for a second, clear water gleamed within it,
but as he approached Dumbledore’s mouth, the water vanished again.“Sir, I’m trying, I’m trying!” said Harry desperately, but he will be
marked on how well they perform each of the tournament tasks and the
champion with the highest total after task three will win the Triwizard Cup.
The champions will be chosen by an impartial selector: the Goblet of Fire.”
Dumbledore now took out his wand and tapped three times upon the top of
the casket. The lid creaked slowly open. Dumbledore reached inside it and
pulled out a large, roughly hewn wooden cup. It would have been entirely
unremarkable had it not been full to the brim with dancing blue problem facing him:
how to survive underwater for an hour on the twenty-fourth of February.
Ron quite liked the idea of using the Summoning Charm again — Harry
had explained about Aqua-Lungs, and Ron couldn’t see why Harry shouldn’t
Summon one from the nearest Muggle town. Hermione squashed this plan by
pointing out that, in the unlikely event that Harry managed to learn how to

Every so often he hit more dead ends, but the increasing darkness made
him feel sure he was getting near the heart of the maze. Then, as he strode
down a long, straight path, he saw movement once again, and his beam of
wandlight hit an extraordinary creature, one which he had only seen in picture
form, in his 
Monster Book of Monsters.
It was a sphinx. It had the body of an over-large lion: great clawed paws
and a long yellowish tail ending "

had tampered so ill-advisedly with the deepest laws of magic. Only toward
him was that wand abnormally powerful. Otherwise it was a wand like any
other . . . though a good one, I am sure,” Dumbledore finished kindly.Harry sat in thought for a long time, or perhaps seconds. It was very hard to
be sure of things like time, here.
“He killed me with your wand.”
“He 
failed 
to kill you with my wand,” Dumbledore corrected Harry. “I
think we can agree that you are not dead — , Harry. But — he couldn’t. He
couldn’t kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how, but they’re saying that
when he couldn’t kill Harry Potter, Voldemort’s power somehow broke —
and that’s why he’s gone.”
Dumbledore nodded glumly.
“It’s — it’s 
true
?” faltered Professor McGonagall. “After all he’s done . . .
all the people he’s killed . . . he couldn’t kill a little boy? It’s just
astounding . . . of all the things to stop him . . . but how in the name of heaven
did Harry survive?”
“We can only guess,” until the end. She was buried under my name and
bearing my appearance. Everyone believed her to be me.”
The man’s eyelids flickered.
“And what did your father do with you, when he had got you home?” said
Dumbledore quietly.
“Staged my mother’s death. A quiet, private funeral. That grave is empty.
The house-elf nursed me back to health. Then I had to be concealed. I had to
be controlled. My father had to use a number of spells to subdue me. When I

magical object in one stroke. Ah, poor Lucius . . . what with Voldemort’s fury
about the fact that he threw away the Horcrux for his own gain, and the fiasco
at the Ministry last year, I would not be surprised if he is not secretly glad to
be safe in Azkaban at the moment.”Harry sat in thought for a moment, then asked, “So if all of his Horcruxes
are destroyed, Voldemort 
could
 be killed?”
“Yes, I think so,” said Dumbledore. “Without   Harry, “but you were wrong.”
For the first time, the watching crowd stirred as the hundreds of people
around the walls drew breath as one.
“Dumbledore is dead!”
 Voldemort hurled the words at Harry as though
they would cause him unendurable pain. “His body decays in the marble tomb
in the grounds of this castle, I have seen it, Potter, and he will not return!”
“Yes, Dumbledore’s dead,” said Harry calmly, “but you didn’t have him
killed. He chose his own manner of dying, chose it months before he died,
arra one’s unconscious, bud we could feel a bulse —”
There was a loud bang and a yell from behind the dais. Harry saw
Kingsley, yelling in pain, hit the ground. Bellatrix Lestrange turned tail and
ran as Dumbledore whipped around. He aimed a spell at her but she deflected
it. She was halfway up the steps now —“Harry — no!” cried Lupin, but Harry had already ripped his arm from
Lupin’s slackened grip.
“SHE KILLED SIRIUS!” bellowed Harry. “SHE KILLED HIM — I’LL
KILL HER!”
And he was off, scrambling up the stone be  hesitate? Was it only reluctantly that
Dumbledore set out to capture the man he was once so delighted he had
met?
And how did the mysterious Ariana die? Was she the inadvertent
victim of some Dark rite? Did she stumble across something she ought
not to have done, as the two young men sat practicing for their attempt at
glory and domination? Is it possible that Ariana Dumbledore was the
first person to die “for the greater good”?
The chapter ended here and Harry looked up. Hermione had reached the
bottom of ed his throat; it was dry from panic and the smoke.
“Hagrid, he killed . . .”
“Killed?” said Hagrid loudly, staring down at Harry. “Snape killed?
What’re yeh on abou’, Harry?”
“Dumbledore,” said Harry. “Snape killed . . . Dumbledore.”
Hagrid simply looked at him, the little of his face that could be seen
completely blank, uncomprehending.

glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley
had punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked about his own
appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt oflightning. He had had it as long as he could remember, and the first question
he could ever remember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it.

arry lay flat on his back, breathing hard as though he had been running.
He had awoken from a vivid dream with his hands pressed over his
face. The old scar on his forehead, which was shaped like a bolt of lightning,
was burning beneath his fingers as though someone had just pressed a white-
hot wire to his skin.
He sat up, one hand still on his scar, the other reaching out in the darkness
for his glasses, which were on the bedside table. He put  scar again. It wasn’t the pain that bothered
him; Harry was no stranger to pain and injury. He had lost all the bones from
his right arm once and had them painfully regrown in a night. The same arm
had been pierced by a venomous foot-long fang not long afterward. Only last
year Harry had fallen fifty feet from an airborne broomstick. He was used to
bizarre accidents and injuries; they were unavoidable if you attended
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and had a knack for attracting a
lot of trouble. e lightning scar on Harry’s forehead with a long,
white finger.
“I’m sorry to say I sold the wand that did it,” he said softly. “Thirteen-and-
a-half inches. Yew. Powerful wand, very powerful, and in the wrong
hands . . . well, if I’d known what that wand was going out into the world to
do. . . .”
He shook his head and then, to Harry’s relief, spotted Hagrid.
“Rubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you again. . . . Oak, sixteen
inches, rather bendy, wasn’t it?”
“It was, sir, yes,” said Hagrid.“Good wand, th way.”
He set off at a brisk pace, past an empty inn and a few houses. According
to a clock on a nearby church, it was almost midnight.
“So tell me, Harry,” said Dumbledore. “Your scar . . . has it been hurting at
all?”Harry raised a hand unconsciously to his forehead and rubbed the
lightning-shaped mark.
“No,” he said, “and I’ve been wondering about that. I thought it would be
burning all the time now Voldemort’s getting so powerful again.”
He glanced up at Dumbledore and saw that he was wearing a satisfied 
No, the thing that was bothering Harry was that the last time his scar had
hurt him, it had been because Voldemort had been close by. . . . But
Voldemort couldn’t be here, now. . . . The idea of Voldemort lurking in Privet
Drive was absurd, impossible. . . .
Harry listened closely to the silence around him. Was he half-expecting to
hear the creak of a stair or the swish of a cloak? And then he jumped slightly
as he heard his cousin Dudley give a tremendous grunting snore from the next
room.
Harry shook him ce indeed. Looks goblin-made, that. Where did you get
something like this?”
“It’s my father’s,” Harry lied, hoping against hope that it was too dark for
Greyback to see the name etched just below the hilt. “We borrowed it to cut
firewood —”“’ang on a minute, Greyback! Look at this, in the 
Prophet

As Scabior said it, Harry’s scar, which was stretched tight across his
distended forehead, burned savagely. More clearly than he could make out
anything around him, he saw a towering building, a grim fortress,  e only living creature in this house
who didn’t flinch at the sight of him.
Harry, though still rather small and skinny for his age, had grown a few
inches over the last year. His jet-black hair, however, was just as it always had
been — stubbornly untidy, whatever he did to it. The eyes behind his glasses
were bright green, and on his forehead, clearly visible through his hair, was a
thin scar, shaped like a bolt of lightning.
Of all the unusual things about Harry, this scar was the most extraordinary

“I think he’s brilliant,” said Harry coldly.
“
Do
 you?” said the boy, with a slight sneer. “Why is he with you? Where
are your parents?”
“They’re dead,” said Harry shortly. He didn’t feel much like going into the
matter with this boy.
“Oh, sorry,” said the other, not sounding sorry at all. “But they were 
ourkind, weren’t they?”
“They were a witch and wizard, if that’s what you mean.”
“I really don’t think they should let the other sort in, do you? They’re just

nobody will believe. Fudge is behind it, I’ll bet anything. They want wizards

tells ridiculous tall stories because he loves being famous and wants to keep it
going.”“I didn’t ask — I didn’t want — 
Voldemort killed my parents!
” Harry
spluttered. “I got famous because he murdered my family but couldn’t kill
me! Who wants to be famous for that? Don’t they th ?” asked Harry, who found Ron just as
interesting as Ron found him.
“Er — yes, I think so,” said Ron. “I think Mum’s got a second cousin
who’s an accountant, but we never talk about him.”
“So you must know loads of magic already.”The Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale boy
in Diagon Alley had talked about.
“I heard you went to live with Muggles,” said Ron. “What are they like?”
“Horrible — well, not all of them. My aunt and uncle and cousin are,

“Listen, Hermione, I can tell it’s not a girl. I can just tell.”
“The truth is that you don’t think a girl would have been clever enough,”
said Hermione angrily.
“How can I have hung round with you for five years and not think girls are
clever?” said Harry, stung by this. “It  them. I loved my parents, I loved my brother
and my sister, but I was selfish, Harry, more selfish than you, who are a
remarkably selfless person, could possibly imagine.
“So that, when my mother died, and I was left the responsibility of a
damaged sister and a wayward brother, I returned to my village in anger and
bitterness. Trapped and wasted, I thought! And then, of course, he came. . . .”
Dumbledore looked directly into Harry’s eyes again.
“Grindelwald. You cannot imagine how his ideas caught me, Harr  and

the article, and Cedric hadn’t been mentioned at all.

“But will it cover all three of us?” said Ron.
“All — all three of us?”
“Oh, come off it, you don’t think we’d let you go alone?”
“Of course not,” said Hermione briskly. “How do you think you’d get to

“No problem,” said George from the front passenger seat. “Out of the way,
Harry.”
Fred and George climbed catlike through the window into Harry’s room.
You had to hand it to them, thought Harry, as George took an ordinary hairpinfrom his pocket and started to pick the lock.
“A lot of wizards think it’s a waste of time, knowing this sort of Muggle
trick,” said Fred, “but we feel they’re skills worth learning, even if they are a
bit slow.”
There was a small click and the door swung open.
“So — we’ll get your understood why the Wizarding
community preferred Scrimgeour to Fudge as a leader in these dangerous
times.
“How do you do?” said the Prime Minister politely, holding out his hand.
Scrimgeour grasped it briefly, his eyes scanning the room, then pulled out a
wand from under his robes.
“Fudge told you everything?” he asked, striding over to the door and
tapping the keyhole with his wand. The Prime Minister heard the lock click.
“Er — yes,” said the Prime Minister. “And if you don’t mind, I’d rather

old smile. “I’ll just —”
He put his hand on the door knob, but Ron and Harry both pointed their
wands at him.
“You can go first,” Ron snarled.
White-faced and wandless, Lockhart approached the opening.
“Boys,” he said, his voice feeble. “Boys, what good will it do?”
Harry jabbed him in the back with his wand. Lockhart slid his legs into the
pipe.
“I really don’t think —” he started to say, but Ron gave him a push, and he
slid out of sight. Harry followed quickly. He lo e, be reasonable,” said Fudge. “This door’s been locked, we
just saw —”
“THEY HELPED HIM ESCAPE, I KNOW IT!” Snape howled, pointing at
Harry and Hermione. His face was twisted; spit was flying from his mouth.
“Calm down, man!” Fudge barked. “You’re talking nonsense!”
“YOU DON’T KNOW POTTER!” shrieked Snape. “HE DID IT, I KNOW
HE DID IT —”
“That will do, Severus,” said Dumbledore quietly. “Think about what you
are saying. This door has been locked since I left the ward ten minutes ago.

hoarse roar, then retreated. Harry could see it trembling, and as they drew
nearer he saw the scars made by vicious slashes across its face, and guessed
that it had been taught to fear hot swords when it heard the sound of the
Clankers.
“Make him press his hand to the door!” Griphook urged Harry, who turned
his wand again upon Bogrod. The old goblin obeyed, pressing his palm to the
wood, and the door of the vault melted away to reveal a cavel passageway.
“What if he’s — ?”
“He’ll be all right,” said Harry, trying to convince himself. “What do you

“We’ve had Sprout’s, that was the Devil’s Snare; Flitwick must’ve putcharms on the keys; McGonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them

They had reached another door.
“All right?” Harry whispered.

Harry pushed it open.

up over their noses. Eye e and the walls and grounds of

Snape eyed Harry, tracing his mouth with one long, thin finger as he did so.

“Shouldn’t have let Professor Snape teach us that one,” said Harry
furiously, kicking Lockhart’s trunk aside. Lockhart was looking up at him,
feeble once more. Harry was still pointing his wand at him.
“What d’you want me to do?” said Lockhart weakly. “I don’t know where
the Chamber of Secrets is. There’s nothing I can do.”
“You’re in luck,” said Harry, forcing Lockhart to his feet at wandpoint.

What does the Imperius Curse do?,Controls the victim,"The Imperius Curse is a powerful curse that can control a person's actions, making them do things against their will.

Ron gave an involuntary shudder.
“Years back, there were a lot of witches and wizards being controlled by
the Imperius Curse,” said Moody, and Harry knew he was talking about the
days in which Voldemort had been all-powerful. “Some job for the Ministry,
trying to sort out who was being forced to act, and who was acting of their
own free will.
“The Imperius Curse can be fought, and I’ll be teaching you how, but it
takes real strength of character, and not everyone’s got it. Better a e Dark Arts.
To their surprise, Professor Moody had announced that he would be putting
the Imperius Curse on each of them in turn, to demonstrate its power and to
see whether they could resist its effects.
“But — but you said it’s illegal, Professor,” said Hermione uncertainly as
Moody cleared away the desks with a sweep of his wand, leaving a large clear
space in the middle of the room. “You said — to use it against another human

“Dumbledore wants you taught what it feels like,” said Moody, his magi  their Prime Minister gets put under the Imperius Curse. The new

“I’m not getting rid of Kingsley Shacklebolt, if that’s what you’re
suggesting!” said the Prime Minister hotly. “He’s highly efficient, gets
through twice the work the rest of them —”
“That’s because he’s a wizard,” said Scrimgeour, without a flicker of a
smile. “A highly trained Auror, who has been assigned to you for your
protection.”
“Now, wait a moment!” declared the Prime Minister. “You can’t just put
you  much as a nosebleed. But that doesn’t matter.
I’m not here to teach you how to do it.
“Now, if there’s no countercurse, why am I showing you? 
Because you’ve

 You’ve got to appreciate what the worst is. You don’t want to

“Now . . . those three curses — 
Avada Kedavra,
 Imperius, and Cruciatus —
are known as the Unforgivable Curses. The use of any one of them on a
fellow human  !”
 Harry yelled. The spell hit the skrewt’s armor again and
ricocheted off; Harry staggered back a few paces and fell over.
“IMPEDIMENTA!”
The skrewt was inches from him when it froze — he had managed to hit it
on its fleshy, shell-less underside. Panting, Harry pushed himself away from it
and ran, hard, in the opposite direction — the Impediment Curse was not
permanent; the skrewt would be regaining the use of its legs at any moment.
He took a left path and hit a dead end, a right, and hit another; forcin eted. Harry fully expected to receive low marks
on his, because he had disagreed with Snape on the best way to tackle
dementors, but he did not care: Slughorn’s memory was the most important
thing to him now.
“I’m telling you, the stupid Prince isn’t going to be able to help you with
this, Harry!” said Hermione, more loudly. “There’s only one way to force
someone to do what you want, and that’s the Imperius Curse, which is illegal

“Yeah, I know that, thanks,” said Harry, not looking up from the book.

There was another yell from below, rather louder than the last. Malfoy

went on: “So poor Rosmerta was forced to lurk in her own bathroom and pass

Who teaches Transfiguration at Hogwarts?,Minerva McGonagall,Professor McGonagall teaches Transfiguration at Hogwarts.,"was a tiny little wizard who had to
stand on a pile of books to see over his desk. At the start of their first class he
took the roll call, and when he reached Harry’s name he gave an excited
squeak and toppled out of sight.
Professor McGonagall was again different. Harry had been quite right to
think she wasn’t a teacher to cross. Strict and clever, she gave them a talking-
to the moment they sat down in her first class.
“Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you
will learn at Hog ng Secrecy — it
was too much to hope that no Muggles would spot an Aqua-Lung zooming
across the countryside to Hogwarts.
“Of course, the ideal solution would be for you to Transfigure yourself into
a submarine or something,” Hermione said. “If only we’d done human
Transfiguration already! But I don’t think we start that until sixth year, and it
can go badly wrong if you don’t know what you’re doing. . . .”
“Yeah, I don’t fancy walking around with a periscope sticking out of my
head,” said Harry. “I s’pose I d the brains, or the power!
“Only the Transfiguration teacher, Dumbledore, seemed to think Hagrid
was innocent. He persuaded Dippet to keep Hagrid and train him as
gamekeeper. Yes, I think Dumbledore might have guessed. . . . Dumbledore
never seemed to like me as much as the other teachers did. . . .”
“I bet Dumbledore saw right through you,” said Harry, his teeth gritted.
“Well, he certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on me after Hagrid was
expelled,” said Riddle carelessly. “I knew it wouldn’t be safe particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into
something else, of course, it’s supposed to be very difficult —”; “You’ll be
starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing —”).
Harry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at the High
Table again. Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet. Professor
McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore. Professor Quirrell, in his
absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked no ything else
we’ve got to do?”
All the fourth years had noticed a definite increase in the amount of work
they were required to do this term. Professor McGonagall explained why,
when the class gave a particularly loud groan at the amount of Transfiguration
homework she had assigned.
“You are now entering a most important phase of your magical education!”
she told them, her eyes glinting dangerously behind her square spectacles.
“Your Ordinary Wizarding Levels are drawing closer —”
“We don’t take O.W.L.s till and Transfiguration too. Harry frequently looked over at
his classmates in the common room or at mealtimes to see them purple in the
face and straining as though they had overdosed on U-No-Poo; but he knew
that they were really struggling to make spells work without saying
incantations aloud. It was a relief to get outside into the greenhouses; they
were dealing with more dangerous plants than ever in Herbology, but at least
they were still allowed to swear loudly if the Venomous Tentacula seized
them unexp k than either of the
others. Difficult and dangerous though it would undoubtedly be, Moody was
right: Harry had managed to find his way past monstrous creatures and
enchanted barriers before now, and this time he had some notice, some chance
to prepare himself for what lay ahead.
Tired of walking in on Harry, Hermione, and Ron all over the school,Professor McGonagall had given them permission to use the empty
Transfiguration classroom at lunchtimes. Harry had soon mastered the
Impediment Curse, a spell to s eep-seated
confusion.

be a plea for attention.”

“Here it is,” said Hermione excitedly as she found the page headed 
The
Polyjuice Potion.
 It was decorated with drawings of people halfway through
transforming into other people. Harry sincerely hoped the artist had imagined
the looks of intense pain on their faces.
“This is the most complicated potion I’ve ever seen,” said Hermione as
they scanned the recipe. “Lacewing flies, leeches, fluxweed, and knotgrass,”
she murmured, running her finger g up at Hagrid. “The Polyjuice
Potion is designed for human use only.”
“None of the Order would have told Voldemort we were moving tonight,”
said Harry. The idea was dreadful to him, he could not believe it of any of
them. “Voldemort only caught up with me toward the end, he didn’t knowwhich one I was in the beginning. If he’d been in on the plan he’d have
known from the start I was the one with Hagrid.”
“Voldemort caught up with you?” said Lupin sharply. “What happened?
How did you escape?”
Harry explained see him, but
he seems in no immediate danger.”
Harry did as he was told; Dumbledore covered Moody in the cloak, tucked
it around him, and clambered out of the trunk again. Then he picked up the
hip flask that stood upon the desk, unscrewed it, and turned it over. A thick
glutinous liquid splattered onto the office floor.
“Polyjuice Potion, Harry,” said Dumbledore. “You see the simplicity of it,and the brilliance. For Moody never

Hermione’s hand was fastest once more.
“It’s Polyjuice Potion, sir,” she said.
Harry too had recognized the slow-bubbling, mudlike substance in the
second cauldron, but did not resent Hermione getting the credit for answering
the question; she, after all, was the one who had succeeded in making it, back
in their second year.

common room right now, if only we could hear him.”
“This Polyjuice stuff sounds a bit dodgy to me,” said Ron, frowning. “What
if we were stuck looking like three of the Slytherins forever?”
“It wears off after a while,” said Hermio he’s Mafalda Hopkirk,” he said, reading a small card that identified their
victim as an assistant in the Improper Use of Magic Office. “You’d better take

He passed her several small golden coins, all embossed with the letters

“It seems all right,” said Hermione, still staring at the book suspiciously. “I

What is the name of Voldemort's snake?,Nagini,The name of Voldemort's snake is Nagini.," snake emerged to climb slowly up Voldemort’s chair. It rose,
seemingly endlessly, and came to rest across Voldemort’s shoulders: its neck
the thickness of a man’s thigh; its eyes, with their vertical slits for pupils,
unblinking. Voldemort stroked the creature absently with long thin fingers,
still looking at Lucius Malfoy.
“Why do the Malfoys look so unhappy with their lot? Is my return, my riseto power, not the very thing they professed to desire for so many years?”
“Of course, my Lord,” said Lucius Malf serpent, which relinquished its hold
upon Voldemort at once and turned, hissing furiously, to face Dumbledore.
Voldemort vanished. The snake reared from the floor, ready to strike —
There was a burst of flame in midair above Dumbledore just as Voldemort
reappeared, standing on the plinth in the middle of the pool where so recently
the five statues had stood.
“Look out!” 
Harry yelled.
But even as he shouted, one more jet of green light had flown at
Dumbledore from Voldemort’s wand and the snake had struck —  Voldemort, who stood with his head bowed, and
his white hands folded over the Elder Wand in front of him. He might have
been praying, or else counting silently in his mind, and Harry, standing still
on the edge of the scene, thought absurdly of a child counting in a game of
hide-and-seek. Behind his head, still swirling and coiling, the great snake
Nagini floated in her glittering, charmed cage, like a monstrous halo.
When Dolohov and Yaxley rejoined the circle, Voldemort looked up.
“No sign of him, my Lor He’s in the Shrieking Shack. The snake’s with him, it’s got some sort of
magical protection around it. He’s just sent Lucius Malfoy to find Snape.”
“Voldemort’s sitting in the Shrieking Shack?” said Hermione, outraged.
“He’s not — he’s not even

?”
“He doesn’t think he needs to fight,” said Harry. “He thinks I’m going to go
to him.”
“But why?”
“He knows I’m after Horcruxes — he’s keeping Nagini close beside him —
obviously I’m going to have to go to him to get near the thing —”

DUMBLEDORE’S GIANT MISTAKE
Albus Dumbledore, eccentric headmaster of Hogwarts School of
Witchcraft and Wizardry, has never been afraid to make
controversial staff appointments, 
writes Rita Skeeter, Special
Correspondent.
 In September of this year, he hired Alastor “Mad-
Eye” Moody, the notoriously jinx-happy ex-Auror, to teach Defense
Against  werewolf Remus Lupin, half-giant Rubeus Hagrid, and delusional
ex-Auror ‘Mad-Eye’ Moody.
“Rumors abound, of course, that Albus Dumbledore, once Supreme
Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards and Chief Warlock
of the Wizengamot, is no longer up to the task of managing the prestigious
school of Hogwarts.
“‘I think the appointment of the Inquisitor is a first step toward ensuring
that Hogwarts has a headmaster in whom we can all repose confidence,’ said
a Ministry insider last night.
“Wizengamot ked, before he could stop himself.
“’Course,” said Hagrid. “They wanted Dumbledore fer Minister, o’ course,
but he’d never leave Hogwarts, so old Cornelius Fudge got the job. Bungler if
ever there was one. So he pelts Dumbledore with owls every morning, askin’
fer advice.”
“But what does a Ministry of Magic 
do
?”
“Well, their main job is to keep it from the Muggles that there’s still
witches an’ wizards up an’ down the country.”
“Why?”

“It — well — it shows me my family —”
“And it showed your friend Ron himself as Head Boy.”
“How did you know — ?”
“I don’t need a cloak to become invisible,” said Dumbledore gently. “Now,
can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?”
Harry shook his head.
“Let me explain. The happiest man on earth would be able to use the
Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it and see
himself exactly as he is. Does that help?”
Harry thought. Then he said slo e other than Albus
Dumbledore. Harry must have walked straight past him, so desperate to get to
the mirror he hadn’t noticed him.“I — I didn’t see you, sir.”
“Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you,” said Dumbledore,
and Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling.
“So,” said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with Harry,
“you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of
Erised.”
“I didn’t know it was called that, sir.”
“But I expect you’ve real n driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible.

He looked in the mirror again. A woman standing right behind his
reflection was smiling at him and waving. He reached out a hand and felt the
air behind him. If she was really there, he’d touch her, their reflections were
so close together, but he felt only air — she and the others existed only in the
mirror.
She was a very pretty woman. She had dark red hair and her eyes — 
her
eyes are just like mine,
 Harry thought, edging a little closer to the glass.
 f the way.
It was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold
frame, standing on two clawed feet. There was an inscription carved around
the top: 
Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi.
His panic fading now that there was no sound of Filch and Snape, Harry
moved nearer to the mirror, wanting to look at himself but see no reflection
again. He stepped in front of it.
He had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming. He
whirled around. His heart was pounding far  ck at the mirror, raised it in front of his face
with trembling hands, and said, loudly and clearly, “Sirius.”
His breath misted the surface of the glass. He held the mirror even closer,
excitement flooding through him, but the eyes blinking back at him through
the fog were definitely his own.
He wiped the mirror clear again and said, so that every syllable rang clearly
through the room, “Sirius Black!”
Nothing happened. The frustrated face looking back out of the mirror was
still, definitely, his own. . .  otter. I need to examine this interesting mirror.”
It was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell. It
was the Mirror of Erised.
“This mirror is the key to finding the Stone,” Quirrell murmured, tapping
his way around the frame. “Trust Dumbledore to come up with something like
this . . . but he’s in London . . . I’ll be far away by the time he gets back. . . .”
All Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and stop him
from concentrating on the mirror.
“I saw you and Sna  thought desperately. 
I must look and lie about what I see,
that’s all.
Quirrell moved close behind him. Harry breathed in the funny smell that
seemed to come from Quirrell’s turban. He closed his eyes, stepped in front of
the mirror, and opened them again.
He saw his reflection, pale and scared-looking at first. But a moment later,
the reflection smiled at him. It put its hand into its pocket and pulled out a
blood-red stone. It winked and put the Stone back in its pocket — and as it
did so, Harry felt so"

They listened. Some distance to their right, the something big was snapping

Harry snapped the earmuffs over his ears. They shut out sound completely.
Professor Sprout put the pink, fluffy pair over her own ears, rolled up thesleeves of her robes, grasped one of the tufty plants firmly, and pulled hard.
Harry let out a gasp of surprise that no one could hear.
Instead of roots, a small, muddy, and extremely ugly baby popped out of
the earth. The leaves were growing right out of his head. He had pale green,
mottled skin, and was clearly bawling at the t sted rather
than revolted, but putting down his rock cake all the same.
“Jus’ giant grubs,” said Hagrid.
“And they grow into . . . ?” said Ron, looking apprehensive.“They won’ grow inter nuthin’,” said Hagrid. “I got ’em ter feed ter

And without warning, he burst into tears.
“Hagrid!” cried Hermione, leaping up, hurrying around the table the long
way to avoid the barrel of maggots, and putting an arm around his shaking
shoulders. “What is it?”
“It’s . . . him . . .” gulped Hagrid, his beetle-black  n’t tell which. . . . It was making a horrible noise,
a yowling, screeching scream. . . .“Keep back there, Hagrid!” yelled a wizard near the fence, straining on the
chain he was holding. “They can shoot fire at a range of twenty feet, you
know! I’ve seen this Horntail do forty!”
“Is’n’ it beautiful?” said Hagrid softly.
“It’s no good!” yelled another wizard. “Stunning Spells, on the count of

Harry saw each of the dragon keepers pull out his wand.
“Stupefy!”
 they shouted in unison, and the Stunning  muffled sort of thump he landed on something soft.
He sat up and felt around, his eyes not used to the gloom. It felt as though he
was sitting on some sort of plant.
“It’s okay!” he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp, which was
the open trapdoor, “it’s a soft landing, you can jump!”
Ron followed right away. He landed, sprawled next to Harry.
“What’s this stuff?” were his first words.“Dunno, some sort of plant thing. I suppose it’s here to break the fall. Come

He turned, shook his shaggy head to get the hair out of his face, and gave

sound.
Hagrid gave the shrieking cry again.  stopped. There was a loud bark from the dog, but
Hermione had already jumped. She landed on Harry’s other side.
“We must be miles under the school,” she said.
“Lucky this plant thing’s here, really,” said Ron.
“Lucky!”
 shrieked Hermione. “Look at you both!”
She leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. She had to struggle

with his fellow students, is warned about the dangers of associating
with part-giants.
Harry finished reading and looked up at Ron, whose mouth was hanging
open.
“How did she find out?” he whispered.
But that wasn’t what was bothering Harry.
“What d’you mean, ‘we all hate Hagrid’?” Harry spat at Malfoy. “What’s

forgotten. But this was absurd. He’d never had friends before Hogwarts,
Dudley had made sure of that.
Nevertheless, Harry was determined to find out more about Riddle, so next
day at break, he headed for the trophy room to examine Riddle’s special
award, accompanied by an interested Hermione and a thoroughly
unconvinced Ron, who told them he’d seen enough of the trophy room to last
him a lifetime.
Riddle’s burnished gold shield was tucke ld have involved revealing that he’d gone to
Hogsmeade without permission, and he knew Lupin wouldn’t be very
impressed by that. So he finished his butterbeer, thanked Lupin, and left the
History of Magic classroom.
Harry half wished that he hadn’t asked what was under a dementor’s hood,
the answer had been so horrible, and he was so lost in unpleasant thoughts of
what it would feel like to have your soul sucked out of you that he walked
headlong into Professor McGonagall halfway up the stairs.
“Do watch wh seem to fit at all. Judging by that note, the

She looked nervous even saying the name again.
“What about him?” asked Harry heavily, slumping back in his chair.

“Yeah, very ingenious, Hermione . . .”
“But it would! Maybe she was proud of being half a Prince!”
“Listen, Hermione, I can tell it’s not a girl. I can just tell.”
“The truth is that you don’t think a girl would have been clever enough,”
said Hermione angrily.
“How can I have hung round with you for five years and not think girls are
clever?” said Harry, stung by this. “It . .”
He was already half hoping that she didn’t want to.
“Oh, no, I’d love to go with you as friends!” said Luna, beaming as he had
never seen her beam before. “Nobody’s ever asked me to a party before, as a
friend! Is that why you dyed your eyebrow, for the party? Should I do mine
too?”
“No,” said Harry firmly, “that was a mistake. I’ll get Hermione to put it
right for me. So, I’ll meet you in the entrance hall at eight o’clock then.”
“AHA!” screamed a voice from overhead and both of them jumped;
unnoticed  — yeah, all right,” said Harry. He turned back to Hermione, Ron, and
Nearly Headless Nick. “Brothers and sisters usually go in the same Houses,
don’t they?” he said. He was judging by the Weasleys, all seven of whom had
been put into Gryffindor.
“Oh no, not necessarily,” said Hermione. “Parvati Patil’s twin’s in
Ravenclaw, and they’re identical. You’d think they’d be together, wouldn’t

There was a murmur of interest around the group at this.

The phrase stirred something in Harry’s memory.

The girl smiled.
“She’s my auntie,” she said. “I’m Susan Bones. She told me about your

His stomach turned over.

came.Stumbling backward, Harry raised his wand.

A silvery wisp of vapor shot from the tip of the wand and the dementor

“Are there big blank periods where you don’t know what you’ve been up to?”

“And Morfin never realized he hadn’t done it?”

“But he had this real memory in him all the time!”
“Yes, but it took a great deal of skilled Legilimency to coax it out of him,”

of the sort.

“I couldn’ leave him tied up out there in the snow!” choked Hagrid. “All on

Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another. They had never seen eye
to eye with Hagrid about what he called “interesting creatures” and other
people called “terrifying monsters.” On the other hand, there didn’t seem to
be any particular harm in Buckbeak. In fac ne! Gone! Bless his little beak, he’s

will have led him away on foot?” said Dumbledore, still sounding amused. 
“Come off it, you’ve ridden him, haven’t you?” said Ron.
Harry stepped forward and bowed low to the hippogriff without breaking
eye contact or blinking. After a few seconds, Buckbeak sank into a bow too.

couldn’t see Hagrid’s garden at all.

“A hippogriff,” he said firmly.

parchment perched upon her knees. “My boy, you may well be seeing the
outcome of poor Hagrid’s trouble with the Ministry of Magic! Look

words. Ron noticed nothing; he was too busy describing each of his other
penalties in loving detail.
The great gray hippogriff, Buckbeak, was tethered in front of Hagrid’s

head toward them.

“Hi,” said Cedric, looking around at them all.
Everybody said hi back except Fred and George, who merely nodded. They
had never quite forgiven Cedric for beating their team, Gryffindor,"
What is the name of the school that Harry Potter attends?,Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry,"According to the text, Harry Potter attends Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry."," trained up a bit. With a mum an’ dad like yours, what else would yeh be?
An’ I reckon it’s abou’ time yeh read yer letter.”
Harry stretched out his hand at last to take the yellowish envelope,
addressed in emerald green to Mr. H. Potter, The Floor, Hut-on-the-Rock, The
Sea. He pulled out the letter and read:
HOGWARTS SCHOOL
of
 WITCHCRAFT 
and
 WIZARDRY
Headmaster: Albus Dumbledore
(Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sorc., Chf. Warlock, Supreme
Mugwump, International Confed. of Wizards)
Dear Mr. Potter,
 . .
“You all know, of course, that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years
ago — the precise date is uncertain — by the four greatest witches and
wizards of the age. The four school Houses are named after them: Godric
Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin.
They built this castle together, far from prying Muggle eyes, for it was an age
when magic was feared by common people, and witches and wizards suffered
much persecution.”
He paused, gazed blearily around the room, and c 
“Watch it!” Hagrid roared, pulling Ron away from his precious pumpkins.
It was nearly lunchtime and as Harry had only had one bit of treacle toffeesince dawn, he was keen to go back to school to eat. They said good-bye to
Hagrid and walked back up to the castle, Ron hiccoughing occasionally, but
only bringing up two very small slugs.
They had barely set foot in the cool entrance hall when a voice rang out,
“There you are, Potter — Weasley.” Professor McGonagall was walking
toward them, looking stern. “You  at’s keeping me going. You don’t know what it’s like
here. I don’t 
belong
 here. I belong in your world — at Hogwarts.”
“No, no, no,” squeaked Dobby, shaking his head so hard his ears flapped.
“Harry Potter must stay where he is safe. He is too great, too good, to lose. If
Harry Potter goes back to Hogwarts, he will be in mortal danger.”
“Why?” said Harry in surprise.“There is a plot, Harry Potter. A plot to make most terrible things happen at
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year,” whispere  a
frog? I might get Agrippa — thanks —”
Harry turned over his card and read:
 
ALBUS DUMBLEDORE
 
CURRENTLY  HEADMASTER  OF  HOGWARTS
C
onsidered by many the greatest wizard of modern times,
Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the Dark wizard
Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of
dragon’s blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas
Flamel. Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and tenpin
bowling.Harry turned the card back over and saw, to his astonish id in front of me that he never assumed he knew all of
Hogwarts’s secrets. I’m telling you, if there was one place Vol —”
“Oi!”
“YOU-KNOW-WHO, then!” Harry shouted, goaded past endurance. “If
there was one place that was really important to You-Know-Who, it was
Hogwarts!”
“Oh, come on,” scoffed Ron. “His 
school
?”“Yeah, his school! It was his first real home, the place that meant he was
special; it meant everything to him, and even after he left —”
“This is You-Know-Who we’re talking about, right? Not you? ’ll be a short visit, and then I’ll be gone for good.”
“But where will you go if you don’t come back to school?”
“I thought I might go back to Godric’s Hollow,” Harry muttered. He had
had the idea in his head ever since the night of Dumbledore’s death. “For me,
it started there, all of it. I’ve just got a feeling I need to go there. And I can
visit my parents’ graves, I’d like that.”
“And then what?” said Ron.
“Then I’ve got to track down the rest of the Horcruxes, haven’t I?” said
Harry, his eyes upon Dumb given them a rather high opinion of
themselves . . . and of course Potter has always been allowed an extraordinary
amount of license by the headmaster —”
“Ah, well, Snape . . . Harry Potter, you know . . . we’ve all got a bit of a
blind spot where he’s concerned.”“And yet — is it good for him to be given so much special treatment?
Personally, I try and treat him like any other student. And any other student
would be suspended — at the very least — for leading his friends into such
danger. Consider, Minister"
