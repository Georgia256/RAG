parents felt about him going off to school, because they were both
murdered before he started.”
“And there was no one to care for him?” I ask.
“Well, I’m sure the Dursleys took him in, out of charity. There
are some who would argue that it was the worst fate imaginable.”
“Because he was raised by Muggles,” I say.
“Yes,” says Ske

“I don't know if I can do it,” said Harry.
“What do
you mean?” asked Hermione.
“I mean, it's not like I've ever done it before, you know!” said
Harry. Ron snorted angrily. 
“You're supposed to be a Parselmouth!” he said. ""What's so difficult about saying 'Petrificus Totalus'? You've done that before!"" 
“Yeah, on a spider!” snapped Harry. 

“What's the problem?” demanded Ron.
“It's just – it feels like a really powerful curse. You know, like
Avada Kedavra – you don' t just say them lightly. That's all.”
Hermione was looking at him as if he had suggested selling his wand to her.
“You don t have the faintest idea, do y

you?” she asked. ”Parseltongue – that's a rare gift you've got there, Potter. Rarer than being able t
o speak and understand real Parseltounge. What's more, Parsel
tongues can force people to do their bidding without saying a word.
You can imagine how useful that would be in dueling. Of course, no
one would ever use that sort of thing for their own ends, would they?” 
H

ermiones eyes flickered to Harry, then away again. A moment later, she
stood up, saying, ""Well, if no

one else is interested in
learning a bit more about the Dark Arts, perhaps I will. See you later."" 
She marched off toward the classroom door.

Answer: Dumbledore.
Dumbledore was speaking to the students. He was wearing long black robes
under a cloak, his white hair was disheveled, giving him a vaguely
uncombed look, as though he had just come of age. His long, crooked nose
seemed more crookeder than ever, he was balding, a fact he tried to
compensate for by wearing a shiny wig. Hagrid, looking bronzed after a
summer out doors, stood beside him, leaning on his walking stick, with his
usual shrewd and protective expression on this face.
“It’s always good to see you, Harry,” Dumbledore said quietly. “You’re
looking well.”
“I’m looking forward to seeing what you’ve done with your name,”
Dumbled

said, grinning at Dumbledore. They
all three looked at Ron.
“I’ve been to St Mungo’s,” Ron said in a low voice, glancing around
fearfully. Ron was a year younger than the rest of Hufflepuff’s
class, because his birthday was in September and he, like Harry, had
been placed in Gryffindor’s year. However, this meant that Ron had only
just turned seventeen, which made him the youngest person they had ever

Context. ""The first day of term, a Monday, was always a half-day, so that students could
trudge up to the school in their thousands, their families in tow, waving and weeping
and making promises of good behavior and excellence, which were usually broken

him, that she would put out a hand to tell him she could see him, she was
there, too. But no such picture window was broken that day. He stood
watching as people passed him in ones and twos, some of them looking
around and seeming to be wondering why their son or daughter’s name had
not been called, others hugging their children and smiling with relief, or
squeezing in among the rest of their family group, holding a relative’s hand
or carrying a baby. Some of these people were so famous Harry knew their
names, but what he cared most about was recognizing someone who looked

interfering or they would miss their turn. A woman in front of him

Riddl

terrible, terrible thing. But there was something in it Harry had never
seen before. Something he recognized now but had been unable to identify
in the past: a reflection of himself.
Dumbledore was watching him. And Harry felt, as he had not felt since he’d
watched Snape killing his mother, a great welling of hatred. Unreasoning
hatred. Hatred that was so strong it almost replaced the terror in him

The next morning, Harry woke up late and went to the Great Hall for breakfast. 
He sat next to Ron and Hermione. They were discussing the upcoming task. Ron 
said that he would be happy to compete in a task where you could see where 
you were going. Hermione disagreed. She said that the task would probably be 
something to do with the Dark Arts. 

Harry thought that this was possible, but he 
thought that it would also be something to have to with dragons. This was 
because he had seen a dragon in the woods the previous night. There was an 
unusual dragon that had escaped from Gringotts bank. It had been trapped 
in a cave in one of Hagrid's patches of forest. H
Hagrid had told Harry that 
he had had to kill it. However, Hufflepuff's cup had not been stolen. Instead, it 
had been hidden in an enchanted chest. No one knew where the chest was, or 
if it had ever been found. But Harry was sure that a part of this task had

The fourth year at Hogwarts was the most exciting year of them all. In
addition to their usual classes, they were learning how to play Quidditch.
Harry was learning to be a Seeker. Seekers had a broomstick and had
 to find the snitch. Quirrell was teaching them how
Quiddich was played. Professor McGonagall was showing them the rules of 
the game. After they had learned how it worked, Professor Quiggle took 
them to a Quadditch field. Here, there were three teams of students. Each 
team had seven players. One team had three Chasers, two Beaters, a Keeper, 

and a 
Seeker.

Harry had never seen anything like it before. All of a sudden, he
felt as if he was flying. When he came down, his brooms

as many goals as possible. Goal keepers were in charge of keeping
goals out of their own net. Beater's were defenders. Their job
 was
defend the goals. Finally, Seekes were attackers. Th

was to catch the ball. Once they caught the
ball, th

on the edge of a swimming pool. One was tall and thin and has long white
hair and beard. His face was very wrinkled, yet his eyes were bright, a deep
green, like Harrys.

Q:::: What was the shape of Hagrid's hut? 
 
 Context:::: Harry sat down and began to eat, looking around the
campsite. Hangers of meat and dead rabbits hung from the trees; the fire was
crackling merrily, sending sparks and little flakes of wood into the air. A
very large black dog lay dozing in front of it, its nose quivering as it
snored. Something moved in one ofthe trees overhead: Harry looked up and
saw a pair of orange eyes, glowing in
the darkness.
 Answer:::: Hanger. This is a type of rack for hanging meat.
Hangers are used in kitchens and in camping. They are usually made of
metal and have several hooks for holding meat. In this case, Hargrid has
hangers made from trees, for he is living in tents.
Context:::: He sat in an old armchair, his feet propped up on a stool, reading
a book by candlelight. On the walls around him were various shrunken heads,
some with black eyeholes, some with eyes still green and glinting. Next to the

Harry had been thinking about the diary ever since. It seemed to him
more and more likely that Voldemort had hidden the diaries in order to
create the false memory of himself in them. But what was he trying to hide?
Or what had he been trying not to tell someone? Why had Voldemort been
trying to prevent someone from finding out something? Harry had asked
Dumbledore about this when they had returned to Hogwarts, only to be told
to wait. Wait for what? He was sick of waiting. What was Voldemort trying

the corridor. There was no one there. No one was watching him, no

Answer. Gryfindor has 390 points.
Answer:
Harry looked around at the faces of all those who had sat at
his bedside in hospital, listening to Dumbledore’s words.
But it was the face of one of them that Harry remembered as he lay
in his bed in Gryﬁndor Tower that night, wide awake and thinking of
all the things he still had left to do. That was what Ron had looked like
when he’d asked if Harry was sure he did not want to go home. Ron,
who thought his father would die in Azkaban whether Harry helped or
no, had not asked Harry to leave school. Instead, he was offering his full
support. And Harry knew that Ron would stick with him until the end.
It was not Ron’s face that he remembered, though. His mind kept
drifting back to Professor Lupin. They had only known each other for
a short time. Lup in had never been part of that elite group of students
who had followed Malfoy around, giving him the kind of laughs
